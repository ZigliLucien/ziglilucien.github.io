However, just because two phones measure the same on paper, this does not mean that you can use phone cases designed for either model on the other device.</p><p>Smartphone manufacturers often make changes to the design of their phones, even if the size remains the same as the previous iteration. For example, the placement of the power button or volume button might change. In some instances, the speaker grills change positions. A change in the style and size of camera lenses or camera bars is also a common occurrence.</p><p>Sometimes, even when the stars seem to align, the slightest shifts in design can make a significant difference. This is the case with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a>.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel 10</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel 9</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>152.8mm x 72mm x 8.6mm</p></td><td  ><p>152.8mm x 72mm x 8.5mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>204g</p></td><td  ><p>198g</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>As you can see from the table above, the on-paper measurements of the two Pixels are almost exactly the same. Going off of just the specs, you would think that the Google Pixel 10 can fit Pixel 9 cases. However, this is not the case.</p><p>Google changed the size of the camera island with the Pixel 10, so the shape and length don't match the Pixel 9. The speaker, grills, mic, and USB-C port are also misaligned with the last-gen Pixel. Thus, even if you manage to fit a soft Pixel 9 case on your Pixel 10, you'll end up covering the speaker and getting a poor fit. Hard <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9-and-pixel-9-pro-cases">Pixel 9 cases</a> won't fit the Pixel 10 at all.</p><p>Even if you manage to fit a flexible silicone or TPU case designed for the Pixel 9 on your Pixel 10, it isn't a good idea to do so. Since the case is designed to add protection to the Pixel 9, it will not provide the same level of impact absorption or drop-proofing to your Pixel 10. It's simply not worth the risk. Please buy a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/best-google-pixel-10-cases">Google Pixel 10 case</a> instead. There are plenty of excellent options in varying price ranges.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="2e14a9a2-a995-4388-ae95-96f6621a5d17">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P2VuWjwLCiqD338ULfskKe.jpg' alt="Google Pixel 10 in Indigo"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 10</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Powered by AI magic</strong></em></p><p>The Google Pixel 10 is a spunky little device with improved new cameras, including a brand new telephoto lens.

The event will take place at 5 am ET and will clue users into what's coming next from its Galaxy portfolio. Those interested can watch from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/us/">Samsung Newsroom</a>, Samsung.com, or the company's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/samsung">YouTube channel</a>.</p><p>While we may have an idea about what's to come, the company only teases that you'll see "new" Galaxy devices. However, Samsung states consumers can now reserve its latest Galaxy Tab, the Galaxy Tab S10 Lite, and receive a $50 credit offer for other purchases.</p><p>Keep in mind that this reservation opportunity lasts until September 3, and purchases with the credit must be made between September 4 and October 5.</p><h2 id="a-new-galaxy-is-coming-2">A new Galaxy is coming</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:822px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="8rwfcrNsHJgs68ckMDk4xU" name="samsung-virtual-unpacked-event-septermber-2025" alt="A Samsung Virtual Unpacked teaser, preparing users for a September 4 event." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8rwfcrNsHJgs68ckMDk4xU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="822" height="462" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>So far, we've had official launches for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/the-samsung-galaxy-buds-3-fe-pack-ai-smarts-and-strong-anc">Galaxy Buds 3 FE</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-lite-september-launch-confirmed">Galaxy Tab S10 Lite</a>. Both products are designed to focus on delivering a more "value-focused" launch at a price point consumers may find more agreeable. There's a chance Samsung will showcase these devices during its Virtual Unpacked in September, but there are other highlights to consider.</p><p>We've been hearing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-fe-launch-earlier-than-usual">rumors about a Galaxy S25 FE</a> for quite a while now, and it seems like this virtual event could have those details. A more recent report claims that a launch for the S25 FE could happen sooner than we think, perhaps in September, after this newly revealed event. More than that, we have the expected Galaxy Tab S11 series, which could also stand in the spotlight early next month.</p><p>There was a report after Samsung's July Unpacked from an executive that stated the Galaxy Tab S11 series would launch "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/galaxy-tab-s11-series-launch-shortly-samsung-exec-comment-report">shortly after</a>." It left speculation to believe that we'd see it either in August or September, more so toward the latter, as that would line up with the S10 series in 2024.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Beginning with the former, Google states Translate now offers a new "language practice" feature, which pushes the app to develop "tailored listening and speaking" practice sessions.</p><p>When using Translate, the post states users need only tap "practice" to get going. Initially, the app will ask you what you believe your current "level" is for any given language. Users will find options like Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced. Google says the practices Translate delivers will be generated "on-the-fly," but they will "adapt" to you the better you get.</p><p>Users will be asked about their goal for learning a language they're interested in before getting into the practice session. Google states practices will be in one of two ways: listening or speaking. If you're listening, you will have to tap the words you recognize from the AI-read statement. Speaking is pretty straightforward, as you'll have to say aloud what's in front of you—hints are there, too, just in case.</p><p>Google states this customized learning is rolling out in beta for the Translate app on Android and iOS this week.</p><h2 id="google-translate-meets-gemini-2">Google Translate meets Gemini</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2xfhC9EmAJ8" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>The Translate app's real-time translations are being upgraded this patch, as Google credits its latest AI models for the improvement. Rolling out this week, users can tap "live translate," select the appropriate languages, and begin speaking.

The publication reports that while Project Hypernova is expected to sport a display on its lens, Meta is "setting low expectations for sales." The post by UploadVR quoted TF International Securities analyst <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1960513106704277658">Ming-Chi Kuo on X</a>, who stated that the Hypernova glasses may enter mass production in Q3 2025.</p><p>Meta is supposedly projecting to sell anywhere from 150,000 to 200,000 units over two years.</p><p>Both CNBC and Ming-Chi Kuo highlight Meta's concerns, which the former states revolve around Hypernova's requirement of "more components" and its "slightly heavier and thicker" build. The projections on X suggest that AI is the "selling point" of these new glasses; however, applying such software to an AR device "is still in its nascent stages."</p><p>The analyst presumes that Meta could treat these Hypernova glasses more like an experimental product once it hits the market than a true device to really hook consumers.</p><h2 id="still-looking-ahead-2">Still looking ahead?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jriGiXXyBox8gzXnTUD28B" name="meta-ray-ban-smart-glasses-hypernova-mockup" alt="A mockup of what Meta Hypernova smart glasses could look like using transparent Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jriGiXXyBox8gzXnTUD28B.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Mid-August held <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/metas-next-gen-smart-glasses-could-land-next-month-for-less-cash-than-youd-think">some interesting estimations</a> about how much Meta could charge for its Hypernova glasses. Projections pit the device at around $800, potentially signaling that Meta is looking to go "mainstream" and not just for those eyeing the high-end segment of the market. It was also alleged that Meta was originally thinking of pricing the glasses at $1,000 or higher, but taking into account Apple's $3,500 Vision Pro (and low consumer interest) probably encouraged the company to knock that price down.</p><p>That same report claimed that Meta could be gearing up for a September launch.</p><p>Interest in Project Hypernova has only increased after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-next-gen-ray-ban-hypernova-glasses-semg-bracelet-render-leaks">a few alleged renders leaked</a> via social media in July. While the glasses look similar in design to the Ray-Ban smart glasses, the images suggest a thicker build, which echoes what we're hearing in August. Those leaks also held a glimpse of what Meta's sEMG bracelet could look like.</p><p>This bracelet has been playtested by Android Central's Nicholas Sutrich, who stated that the sEMG add-on is quite necessary for the glasses. In short, "Using a pair of smart glasses without this band is akin to using a smartphone without a touch screen."</p> ]]></dc:content>

Still, if you need a smartphone that's going to last over a day on a single charge, I might look elsewhere. The Z Fold 7 only has IP48 water/dust protection, which could be a problem if you like to take your phone into more rugged environments.</p><p>Indeed, the elephant in the room is that most foldable enthusiasts will be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-vs-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">choosing between the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and the Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a>, and the decision isn't easy.

Both Derrek and I didn't have the feature for the first few days, and it looks like Tom Pritchard <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/phones/google-pixel-phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review-a-great-phone-but-it-doesnt-feel-like-much-of-an-upgrade">from Toms Guide</a> had the same issue. But while our Magic Cue spun up quite nicely and was making suggested actions appear all over the place, Pritchard didn't have the same experience.</p><p>This makes us wonder what people are going to see on their retail units when they collect them tomorrow. Will Magic Cue start working as expected after the 24-hour processing window Google warns about when enabling it, or is this a feature Google will need to iron out for the next few weeks and months?</p><p>Magic Cue should be grabbing information from all kinds of sources and privately disseminating it in appropriate apps, something that certainly feels great when it works, but is frustrating when it doesn't appear, yet you expect it to!</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AyVTFzWUFY5fwxCJLQbsp8" name="google-pixel-10-pro-jade-spigen-magsafe-ring" alt="The jade Google Pixel 10 Pro with a Spigen MagSafe ring attached" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AyVTFzWUFY5fwxCJLQbsp8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Pixel 10 series might look basically identical to the Pixel 9, but there's something important hiding underneath: Pixelsnap.

I couldn't agree more, and it's about time a major Android manufacturer got on board with magnets inside of a phone. I'm a person who doesn't enjoy using cases and usually kept a case in my car just so I could use the magnetic phone mount I've got on my dash. Now I don't need that!</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xoYNUpVZSvwfBKGUhj8XwU" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-white-back-11" alt="A white Google Pixel 10 Pro XL on a latticework black chair" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xoYNUpVZSvwfBKGUhj8XwU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While I've enjoyed my time with the Pixel 10 Pro series and will continue to use it for the next few weeks, I'm looking forward to going back to my OnePlus 13 when all is said and done. But not TechRadar's Philip Berne, who said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/google-pixel-phones/google-pixel-10-pro-xl-review">in his review</a> that the "Pixel 10 Pro XL will be my primary device this year, for sure."</p><p>Berne says the primary reason for this is that the "Pixel 10 Pro XL is polished and well-built, with a refined look and gorgeous materials and color combinations." I agree that it's well-built, but I think Google could do a lot more to make the phone look more unique than an iPhone with a camera bar on the back — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/the-google-pixel-10-is-eerily-similar-to-the-iphone-and-thats-the-point">which is what it looks like right now</a>, let's not kid ourselves.</p><p>Regardless, Berne thinks "it’s a much nicer-looking phone than the latest iPhone 16 Pro Max, and it delivers on a number of features <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/apple">Apple</a> hasn’t been able to match." That second part is mostly indisputable, as Apple Intelligence was a cluster of a rollout for Apple and Google nailed most of the new AI-based features in the Pixel 10 series out of the box.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wVCNRdJmRYDqgJXAXxVp5G" name="google-pixel-10-pro-XL-moonstone-pixelsnap-ring-04" alt="A Google Pixelsnap ring attached to the back of the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL via Qi2 magnets" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wVCNRdJmRYDqgJXAXxVp5G.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of the only downsides to Google adding Pixelsnap magnets inside the Pixel 10 series is that reverse wireless charging had to be sacrificed. This option was also known as Battery Share and could wirelessly charge devices like headphones or even <em>other phones</em> at a slow rate. It was an emergency power bank, in other words.</p><p>But as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-pixel-10-pro-and-pro-xl-review-redefining-the-smart-in-smartphone-170031073.html">Engadget's Sam Rutherford says</a>, "the Pixel 10 family no longer supports reverse wireless powersharing (aka Battery Share)." I can't say I miss the feature as I've never once used it in all my years of reviewing Android phones, but Rutherford laments the missing feature by noting that "every now and then I would find myself with a gadget that needed some juice, and even if it was slow, it was really nice to be able to bestow some excess energy upon a device without a cable."</p><p>Just goes to show you that even the "niche" features considered for the chopping block have their fans. As for me, I'm just glad <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/google-pixelsnap-hands-on">Pixelsnap</a> lets me use magnetic accessories without a case on my phone.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="2LtyEtsYHXBr23afguKxpB" name="google-pixel-10-pro-pixel-features" alt="All the new Google Pixel 10 Pro features in the Pixel Hub app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2LtyEtsYHXBr23afguKxpB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of the best reasons to choose a Pixel is for security and privacy. Privacy might sound a bit like an oxymoron when placed next to Google, but Pixels were built for privacy-first, and the Pixel 10 series furthers that goal with huge improvements to AI processing.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/766613/google-pixel-10-pro-review-ai-magic-cue-camera-pro-res-zoom">The Verge's Allison Johnson</a> mentioned this in her review as one of the highlights of the new phones. "Magic Cue, for example, runs in the background <em>on device</em>. A camera feature...runs a diffusion model <em>on device</em>. Same with the phone call translator that mimics the sound of your voice. It’s more than just an impressive list; running these entirely on the phone means your data is much more private than if it had taken a trip to the cloud."</p><p>That's a huge deal in a world where most companies try to sell you big AI features but often asterisk them with "internet connectivity needed" for it to work. Pixel's approach not only ensures you never need a subscription to get the phone's best AI features, but that your data doesn't leave your phone to get them.

Reading the feature's description reveals that it uses "generative AI" and cloud processing, which might sound scary for photography purists. However, taking a closer look at Camera Coach reveals it's more about empowering Pixel 10 users to take better photos than using AI to make its own edits.</p><p>After sharing your camera viewfinder with Camera Coach (which is optional, by the way), it uses custom Gemini models to give you photography tips specific to your situation. Camera Coach might recommend you adjust the framing or lighting of the shot to get a better result. It might even give you setup ideas based on the scene. This is all happening with off-device AI, but it's deleted when you're done.</p><p>I'm particularly excited about Camera Coach, not because it can be used as a crutch, but because it could serve as a launchpad for people who want to learn core photography skills and don't know where to start.

That should provide extra layers of security and privacy than cloud processing, which offloads your data to Google servers. Still, that might not be enough for some people, leading them to avoid enabling Magic Cue for privacy reasons.</p><p>Which camp do you fall in?

However, there are benefits to eSIM, like increased security in the event your phone is lost or stolen.</p><p>Our own Nicholas Sutrich, who reviewed the Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL, wrote "while eSIM may be fine for some people, I have no interest in switching away from a physical SIM card." Derrek Lee tested the base Pixel 10, and after an initial eSIM failure during the setup process, called the experience "streamlined."

Let's clear the air — while the Pixel 10's main sensor does have fewer megapixels than the Pixel 9's primary shooter, this change was made to fit a third telephoto camera on the back. Megapixels aren't everything when it comes to smartphone photography, so the shift from a 50MP to a 48MP main lens shouldn't concern you.</p><p>In fact, as we've already covered, the addition of a 5x zoom lens on the base-model Pixel 10 is actually an upgrade that brings the phone in line with competitors like the Samsung Galaxy S25.</p><p>When Google made a similar main camera shift on the Pixel 9a earlier this year, we found that the change actually resulted in better color accuracy and produced ideal results. The same seems to be true of the Pixel 10 with its new camera system, as our reviewer Derrek Lee calls the colors "pretty true to life." Additionally, the Pixel 10 series has the Tensor G5 chip with an all-new image-signal processor (ISP), further improving camera performance.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2LoUHptPbpx8EsmAQRBc7a" name="Pixel-10-all-devices" alt="Pixel 10 series - all devices" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2LoUHptPbpx8EsmAQRBc7a.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This year, there are more similarities between the three Google Pixel 10 models than ever. Notably, they're all powered by the Tensor G5 mobile platform and feature three rear cameras. To the untrained eye, it might be difficult to notice that there are just as many differences between the three models, and you won't want to pick the wrong one.</p><p>For starters, the base-model Pixel 10 only gets Wi-Fi 6E support, rather than Wi-Fi 7 on the Pro models and even the older Pixel 9. That might not be a problem today, but it could loom large a few years from now as people move to more advanced networking hardware. Additionally, the 128GB version of the Pixel 10 uses UFS 3.1 for storage as opposed to the newer UFS 4.0 on the 256GB variant.</p><p>To top it off, the Pixel 10 Pro XL is the only model to get Qi2.2 support for 25W fast wireless charging support.

It's a feature that takes a few days to kick in, but when it does, it's worth the wait. Magic Cue is essentially a superpowered version of that nifty feature that gives you automatic replies to messages.</p><p>If someone mentions an event in a message, a new "chip" button will appear at the bottom of the screen that automatically adds it to your calendar. Emails related to phone calls will appear in the dialer, like doctor's appointment reminders or airline details. It even stealth powers some of the other new features, like Daily Hub.</p><p>Voice Translate real-time translates your voice into another language while on a call. It's a fairly convincing version of your voice, too, and while I've heard some people say the translation is a little bit funny, it's still an impressive upgrade over previous real-time text translation features.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1945px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:71.57%;"><img id="dCJkN4sJksj7LFt7nY9miX" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-camera-edit-with-ask-photos" alt="Removing sun flare glare from a picture using Edit with Ask Photos on a Google Pixel 10 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dCJkN4sJksj7LFt7nY9miX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1945" height="1392" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You can now ask Gemini to edit a photo in Google Photos, including commands like removing glare, making it less blurry, enhancing a pet portrait, and more.

The Pixel Watch 4 might work for runners because its speedy charging could top off the used battery while they shower, but I don't know how many of them will be willing to lose that comforting battery buffer.</p><p>If Google sold a Fitbit Sense 3 or Versa 5 that got the Watch 4's new health sensors, better GPS accuracy, and satellite SOS paired with a week of battery life, both casual and serious athletes would trade away the other Pixel Watch 4 perks for that.

The company has announced the new Chipolo Card and Chipolo Loop, aiming to solve one of the big problems with item trackers.</p><p>While devices like the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/motorola-moto-tag-hands-on-review">Moto Tag</a> and Samsung Galaxy SmartTag+ bring an Apple AirTag-like experience to Android with UWB support, one of the main issues with such devices is that they come with a replaceable battery, which, while convenient for some, is still a hassle for others. Chipolo's new trackers aim to solve this with rechargeable batteries.</p><p>Chipolo Loop features a modern circular design with a built-in loop, making it easy to attach to keys or bags, while the Card offers a credit card-like design for wallets. Both Loop and Card offer IP67 water and dust protection, and Chipolo says both trackers are "adventure-proof."</p><h2 id="chipolo-card-supports-qi-wireless-charging-while-loop-uses-a-usb-c-port-2">Chipolo Card supports Qi wireless charging, while Loop uses a USB-C port</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4qMzGYre33JKt7NkcUGxLd" name="chipolo-loop-usb-c" alt="Chipolo Loop with USB-C port" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4qMzGYre33JKt7NkcUGxLd.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Chipolo)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="D2CypoScKFhmP9o2CB6SBd" name="chipolo-card-new" alt="Chipolo's new Card in a wallet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/D2CypoScKFhmP9o2CB6SBd.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Chipolo)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Chipolo Loop is available in six colors: navy, mint, honey, coral, charcoal, and chalk, while the Card only comes in charcoal. The company also claims both Loop and Card are made of "at least" 50% post-consumer recycled plastic.</p><p>Chipolo Loop offers a USB-C port on the bottom, while Chipolo Card supports Qi wireless charging. While the company hasn't explicitly claimed the tracker has a magnetic ring, it does say the Card automatically aligns to the center of the charger. In terms of battery life, the company claims both Loop and Card provide up to 6 months of battery life per charge.</p><p>Both Loop and Card have a Bluetooth range of up to 120m and improved loud sounds for easier tracking. They're compatible with both Android and iOS, working with Apple's Find My and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/find-my-device">Google's Find Hub</a> so you can track essentials directly from the pre-installed app. You can also pair them with the Chipolo companion app for some extra features like Call Your Phone, out-of-range alerts, and adjustable volume.</p><p>Both Chipolo Card and Loop are priced at €45/$39/£39 and are available for pre-order starting today from Chipolo's website and Amazon. They'll also be available at T-Mobile stores and other retailers starting late September 2025.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/Chipolo/page/B8E7D8A8-5BE4-4BC9-B226-8931CC54797D">Pre-order at Chipolo (Amazon)</a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Now, the core Gemini CLI experience is no longer limited to the text-based, command-line format. Gemini CLI expands to the integrated development environment (IDE) starting today, Aug. 28, as it is now natively available in Zed's multiplayer code editor.</p><p>It's the first AI agent to use Zed's new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://agentclientprotocol.com/overview/introduction" target="_blank">Agent Client Protocol (ACP)</a>, but the framework is open to all. As long as a custom agent implements the open-source ACP and follows the right schema, developers can use their own agents in the Zed environment. For now, Gemini CLI and Zed's first-party agent serve as two starting points for developers to see the ACP in action.</p><p>The new Gemini CLI integration with Zed aims to better meet the needs of developers who have workflows centered around IDEs rather than a text-only terminal, according to a press release. The offering takes the existing capabilities of Gemini CLI and adds "real-time agentic edit visualization, multi-buffer reviews, and seamless navigation between agentic editing and your existing code."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1338px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="f7qHLGHHVmerkHkN9thagk" name="Gemini-CLI-Zed" alt="The Gemini CLI side panel in Zed." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f7qHLGHHVmerkHkN9thagk.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1338" height="754" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Zed users can utilize the "gemini" command to get the Gemini CLI experience they're familiar with right in Zed's integrated terminal. Or, they can use Gemini in the new Agent Panel in Zed's code-editing views, built on the ACP. Gemini CLI can be used in Zed to generate and refractor code in your IDE with a simple prompt and hotkey, or to diagnose issues by highlighting suspect code or selecting error messages to get detailed feedback.</p><p>The AI agent functions similarly to a thinking model, showing the visual changes it's making while completing your request — even if the prompt requires editing multiple files. Additionally, the output works more like a pull request than a typical AI agent, showing every edit proposed by Gemini CLI. From there, you can review, accept, or change anything suggested by the AI agent, so you're still in complete control.</p><p>Beyond what you're working with in your local codebase, you can supply Gemini CLI with context from external sources to help it suggest the correct changes. Since this is all happening within Zed, you won't have to leave your preferred IDE to consult the AI agent for help.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1340px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.12%;"><img id="JQHuyCaiAHAHh4Vnrb6ChK" name="Zed-AI-Agent-Panel" alt="The agent panel in the Zed code editor." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JQHuyCaiAHAHh4Vnrb6ChK.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1340" height="752" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you're curious about how it works, like both Gemini CLI and Zed, the process is open source and you can discover it for yourself on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p><p>"We chose to run Gemini CLI as a sub-process, communicating over standard in and standard out," the Zed team explains in a blog post. "We picked JSON RPC for its simplicity and defined a minimal schema for the interaction between Zed, acting as the client a developer uses, and Gemini CLI, running as the agent."</p><p>You can try out Gemini CLI in Zed starting today, and start building AI agents of your own with the ACP.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The website named MediaMarkt - an online electronics website — uploaded an entire product page for the Galaxy S25 FE, even without its launch date being announced.</p><p>The page, now taken down, allegedly featured official-looking posters, which gave us more than enough information on what to expect from the phone. Nieuwe Mobiel was quick enough to download all the images and notes that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nieuwemobiel.nl/Samsung-Galaxy-S25-FE"><u>S25 FE</u></a> is expected to be "thinner and lighter." Which pretty much lines up with earlier leaks that have mentioned the phone to have a 6.7-inch Dynamic AMOLED display, measuring 7.4mm in width and weighing around 190 grams, approximately 20 grams lighter than its predecessor.</p><p>Additionally, the publication notes that it will feature "an even brighter screen thanks to the AI ​​ProVisual Engine and has an Armor Aluminum housing with Gorilla Glass Victus Plus."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1852px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:58.42%;"><img id="5L9u8D8nzHrMdJNRVLXo4j" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-FE" alt="Samsung Galaxy S25 FE leak" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5L9u8D8nzHrMdJNRVLXo4j.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1852" height="1082" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nieuwe Mobiel)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The images show the alleged Fan edition in a "Navy Blue" colorway, with noticeably thinner bezels around the screen. Other supposed specs of the device, it is expected to feature a triple camera array again with a 50MP main sensor, 12MP ultrawide, and an 8MP telephoto. The selfie camera is reported as a 12MP lens with an f/2.2 aperture.</p><p>Under the hood, it is said to get the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-exynos-2400-comeback">Exynos 2400</a>, which is a two-year-old chip by this point. And it could also retain its battery capacity as its predecessor, which is 4,900 mAh.  The S25 FE could debut with two RAM/storage variations of 8/128GB and 8/256GB. It is said to get <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/one-ui">One UI</a> 8 (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/android-16">Android 16</a>) out of the box, loaded with the latest Gemini features, similar to the recently launched foldables lineup.</p><p>As for the cost, the Portuguese website seems to have quoted  €789.99 ($920) for a device, which seems to be on the higher end; however, this could just be a leak or the fact that the website might've jacked up the price. Either way, the publication also notes that the Samsung Galaxy S25 FE "will be officially announced on September 4th, the day before the IFA trade show in Berlin," which doesn't seem too far away.</p> ]]></dc:content>

To begin, the host attempts to remove the inner foldable display, removing the bezels first, before trying to (very carefully) pry off that screen. Though there was a brief jump scare, the screen actually bid farewell to the land of the living shortly after, as Nelson "forgot the ribbon cables" inside.</p><p>Nelson then got a closer look at Samsung's ultra-thin glass layer, which is a very flexible glass layer for the display's functionality. However, quickly bending the display the wrong way spidered the glass. Nelson hopes Samsung could make that thicker, further improving its longevity.</p><p>The cover display was difficult to remove; however, it still functioned as Nelson got to looking at the Flip 7's OIS (optical image stabilization) capabilities. The device's OIS held up well, even while it was open on the operating table, offering little jitter when shaken with the camera app open.</p><p>Diving into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-review">the Flip 7</a>, it was made evident that Samsung had continued to use its pull tabs for the battery and screws for removing most of its initial layer of components. As the publication noted, this could help its repairability score down the line, but there are still difficulties with repairing foldables.</p><p>You can watch Zach Nelson's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/ejGEddhynE0">full teardown of the Flip 7</a>, where he discusses the new changes to the phone's hinge, its thermal specifications, and more.</p><h2 id="teardowns-samsung-s-development-2">Teardowns & Samsung's Development</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4CpynvwwhLRpCAqoaaW9bS" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-7-vs-Flip-6-Cover-Screen-7" alt="The cover screen experience on the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 compared to the Galaxy Z Flip 6." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4CpynvwwhLRpCAqoaaW9bS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Flip 7's ultra-thin glass might sound familiar if you remember <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-development-behind-thinnest-galaxy-z-fold-7-flip-7">Samsung detailing how it created the device</a> and the Fold 7. Funnily enough, Samsung stated that it made the UTG 50% thicker on the Fold 7, which would aid in reducing how noticeable the phone's crease is over time. It's likely a similar upgrade was made to the Flip 7 for its crease. The Flip 7's highlight was its full, edge-to-edge cover display, and its slimmer bezels that Zach Nelson promptly ripped up.</p><p>The Fold 7 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-z-fold-7-teardown-night-terrors-repairability">went through a teardown</a> earlier in August, but that one truly honed in on its repairability, for which there is very little. A video from iFixit spoke about the sheer difficulties one would experience if attempting to fix the Fold 7. It noted how the battery pull tabs are an "inferior" method, as they often break or require too much force, which could bend the battery, rendering it useless.</p><p>Moreover, if your Fold 7's camera has been damaged, someone would have to take the device apart just to fix it.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The key highlight of this update is that Gemini's upgraded image editing is a product of a new model from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-gemini-vision-world-model-explained">Google DeepMind</a>. Google reiterates that all that's required is for you (the user) to provide an image to Gemini to work with.</p><p>Users can apply Gemini's upgraded prompt-based photo editing in a variety of ways.</p><p>One such way is the ability for users to ask Gemini to "blend" two different photos together. For example, users can take a photo of themselves and a photo of their pet and combine them into one coherent image that looks like it always existed. Google states users can upload "multiple photos and blend them together."</p><p>Elsewhere, Gemini's new capabilities can leverage your imagination, turning your once typical selfies into something new. While Gemini reportedly works to keep the subject's core (what they look like) the same, users can tell the AI to change their outfit and change where they are.</p><h2 id="multi-turns-mix-up-prompts-2">Multi-turns & Mix-Up prompts</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:710px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:63.94%;"><img id="pn9mo7VtAYNR3rmAyb3Vug" name="google-gemini-combine-photo-prompt-example" alt="Google's Gemini can now accept prompts and multiple photos to combine those two images into one coherent scenario." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pn9mo7VtAYNR3rmAyb3Vug.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="710" height="454" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:724px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.94%;"><img id="vtkmfsrUgm7npVdVErQVug" name="google-gemini-combined-photo-example" alt="A combined photo, thanks to Gemini's new AI update, that brought two separate photos of a woman and a dog together into one loving, cuddly image." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vtkmfsrUgm7npVdVErQVug.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="724" height="405" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>There are two more prompts that Google states Gemini is proficient at: multi-turn editing and mix-up designs. The former is essentially like the Gemini's version of follow-up questions, but for editing images. Google states users can walk step-by-step through editing with Gemini. Specifically, you can have Gemini change up an empty room, such as painting the walls, and then add quick one-liners for additional changes.</p><p>You can tell Gemini to "add a bookshelf," "add a coffee table," and "add a couch," per Google's example. The post states that everything Gemini has created before is preserved in the image until you're satisfied. For the mix-up designs, users can take a photo and tell Gemini to turn it into a dress on a model or to take a pattern from one image and put it on another.</p><p>The Gemini app is receiving this DeepMind-upgraded prompt-based editing capability today (Aug 26), so users should begin noticing it soon. Moreover, Google states everything Gemini creates will be marked with SynthID, so people know it was created using artificial intelligence.</p><h2 id="built-in-editing-2">Built-in Editing</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.31%;"><img id="UxAQdiDLdwhuqQHaRVxbyV" name="Gemini-image-editor" alt="image editor in Google Gemini app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UxAQdiDLdwhuqQHaRVxbyV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="901" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The newest updates for the Gemini app build upon what <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/geminis-built-in-ai-image-editor-is-here-to-mess-with-your-photos-directly">Google started back in May</a> when the AI received a built-in editor. Users could alter AI-generated photos or their own photos easily with Gemini. Additionally, some features, such as changing backgrounds, adding/removing objects, and blending photos, mirror what Google announced today.</p><p>However, the key difference is the newer model from DeepMind is the newer update further enhances Gemini's image editing capabilities.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The original poster (OP) on the Fold subreddit states that their DND (do not disturb) settings will "reset every couple of days" on their own, and that this is causing major problems for their daily life. DND, of course, would mute notifications from disturbing you if you're busy or otherwise.</p><p>However, the user states, "I have various exemptions set on Do Not Disturb," but it doesn't matter since One UI 8 is resetting those exemptions on its own every so often. The user reports that they're using a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>, which runs One UI 8. Two other users have chimed in, reporting similar issues, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyFold/comments/1miogsv/comment/na57fae/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">though one states</a> it's "bothering me daily."</p><p>This is causing users to miss out on important notifications, as with DND enabled, you can set if you'd like to silence calls, texts, app notifications, and alarms. The OP likely had these more important notifications enabled (calls, texts), but with DND resetting, they're missing out. A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oneui/comments/1miohd6/comment/na5956j/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">user quoted this</a> Galaxy Fold subreddit report over on the One UI side, and signaled that they may have found a temporary workaround.</p><p>They state that they've set up a Routine on their device to only enable DND when charging.

These reports will surely catch Samsung's attention, but when a proper fix will arrive is anyone's guess.</p><p>Speaking of strange bugs in One UI 8, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/one-ui-8-latest-beta-bug-drenches-moon-photos-in-a-purple-hue">during the fourth beta era</a>, users reported an odd purple tint over their moon photos. The bug affected Galaxy S25 Ultras enrolled in the test. Additionally, it only appeared when users zoomed in by 30x, 50x, or 100x with the Intelligent Optimization setting. Samsung seemed to be quick to hop on that problem, encouraging users to head to its Samsung Members app to provide detailed feedback.</p><p>More recently, we've gotten our hands on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/one-ui-8-beta-5-for-samsung-galaxy-s25">One UI 8 Beta 5</a>, which is (hopefully) signaling that we're closing in on a full release. The 1.78GB update includes several software refinements and the August security patch for testers.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Depending on regional pricing, Project Moohan could cost anywhere from $1,799 to $2,999, putting it well above the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a> but below enterprise VR headsets from brands like Sony in the $4,000+ range.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3877px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6gGYa9Lf8aLaVXVCa9G4Eg" name="Samsung-Project-Moohan-MWC-2025-1" alt="Samsung Project Moohan on display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6gGYa9Lf8aLaVXVCa9G4Eg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3877" height="2181" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-could-use-sony-4k-micro-oled-displays-in-project-moohan-headset">previous leak</a> indicated this headset will use a 1.3-inch, 3552×3840 resolution Micro-OLED display with high brightness and a wide color gamut; its 13.64 million pixels per eye would beat the Apple Vision Pro by almost 2 million and crush the Quest 3 (4.56 million).</p><p>Combined with other premium components like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/qualcomm-snapdragon-xr2-plus-gen-2-announced-for-samsung-headset">Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2 chipset</a>, this explains why Samsung would charge top dollar for Moohan.</p><p>But given the Apple Vision Pro's limited sales and Project Moohan's high price, Samsung may not expect to sell many headsets. Previous leaks have claimed that Samsung only hopes to sell 100,000 units, and this latest report claims Samsung "considers the XR headset merely a 'bridgehead' for its transition to smart glasses."</p><p>Samsung and Google have partnered up to make smart glasses together using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a> as the underlying software, same as Project Moohan.

It felt comfortably balanced with a knob fitting it in place, gesture controls were seamless, and app performance was speedy.</p><p>The main question with Moohan will come down to audience and apps. Most core Google apps have been converted into XR format, while other Android apps will be available as floating 2D windows. Otherwise, it's unclear what kind of gaming library Project Moohan will have, nor whether premium users will find Moohan more tempting than the Apple Vision Pro.</p> ]]></dc:content>

We all use our phones while they're plugged in at least every once in a while, so this kind of thing is really good to talk about.</p><p>The quick answer: using your phone while it's charging, especially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-ultra-leak-reveals-a-slimmer-beast-with-blazing-fast-charging">fast charging</a>, causes more heat to build up.

Electronics are like that, and the way electricity works "creates" heat, so it's not uncommon to see something like a microprocessor reach temperatures into the 75 °C range.</p><p>Your phone has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-turns-off-when-extremely-warm">a built-in method</a> to funnel this heat away as fast as it can, though. Some phones are better than others, but every phone has passed testing so that the designers and engineers are satisfied. When you're actively using your phone, it "creates" more heat than when it's idle and the display is off.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="TnpFPnouK6wRZUu93pnRCQ" name="google-pixel-10-wireless-qi2-charging-dock-03" alt="The official Google Pixelsnap Qi2 wireless charger and dock for the Google Pixel 10 series" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TnpFPnouK6wRZUu93pnRCQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Charging your phone also "creates" heat. I'm using quotes around the word creates because technically, it's a conversion of one type of energy into another, but "creates" is easier to understand; it makes things get hotter.</p><p>Other things your phone can and will do when it gets close to being too hot are forcing the processor and GPU to run slower, and even changing the brightness and refresh rate of the display. You might notice this, but know it's done by design to slow down the rate at which the heat is "created".</p><p>Finally, heat negatively affects the cells in your phone's battery. It <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-take-care-your-phones-battery">lessens the battery's lifespan</a> and capacity and eventually leads to component failure. In severe cases, it can cause <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-makes-phone-battery-explode">a catastrophic failure</a>, which creates something known as thermal runaway, and your phone could catch fire or explode. Thankfully, that rarely happens.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3754px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.21%;"><img id="Qhcu9RAp4NNJeqCcYKfgJK" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S22-review-rear-bottom.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy S22 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Qhcu9RAp4NNJeqCcYKfgJK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3754" height="2110" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's also the chance of mechanical damage caused by using a phone while it's plugged in. The cable port was designed to be used when the phone is in one place, and holding it can lead to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-cables-adapters">USB port</a> connection to the main board coming loose.</p><p>In short, using your phone while you're charging it, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-wireless-chargers"><strong>even with a wireless charger</strong></a>, means it will have a shorter lifespan. But it's not as bad as you might be thinking for most of us.</p><h2 id="you-aren-t-keeping-it-forever-2">You aren't keeping it forever</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="hBkaGZRqYXh3onjPXQaZ2b" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-hazel-back-with-box-2025-02" alt="The Hazel Google Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hBkaGZRqYXh3onjPXQaZ2b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The extra heat caused by using a phone that's charging will make it stop working sooner. There's no question about it. But will it make enough of a difference?</p><p>Not counting your battery, which we'll talk about in a minute, the parts inside your phone will still be in fine working order when you buy a new one. If the heat and clock speeds are managed correctly (they are unless you get in there and change things, voiding the warranty), chances are the components will last for decades.</p><p>Your battery is another story, though. Plain and simple: you are either going to keep a phone long enough to need to change the battery, or you aren't. Two years is about the amount of time it takes before you start to notice your phone battery doesn't hold a charge as long as it used to, but it's measured by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/the-pixel-10s-battery-takes-a-hit-after-200-cycles-courtesy-of-a-feature-you-cant-switch-off">charging cycle</a> and not actual time.</p><p>Starting to see what could be an issue yet? The more often you charge your phone, the shorter the lifespan of the battery will be. That's just how it is, and yes, as it gets older, you'll need to charge it more often, making its lifespan even shorter. The extra heat does have an effect here, but not a huge amount.</p><p>Ideally, you'll set your phone down and give it time to charge before you pick it back up again. Using it while you're charging now and then won't make much of a difference, but doing it all the time will mean you might end up replacing the battery or buying a new phone sooner than you had planned.</p> ]]></dc:content>

On the bright side, there's a decent chance that Mint will run a similar deal on the Google Pixel 10 some day (if we're lucky). Is it worth waiting to see if that happens, or should you jump on this Pixel 9 deal before it's too late? The choice is yours.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Breaking things down, the 3rd-gen indoor Nest camera will allegedly show up 2K HDR camera, a major bump from its 1080p and with a 6x digital zoom. The publication notes that the indoor cam will allow users to "Zoom and Crop" and also focus on a specific zone, for instance, your baby's crib or play area, or your pet's bed. The indoor cam will allow you to record events for up to an hour, even when disconnected from Wifi.</p><p>Additionally, "Google is keeping all of the usual features that Nest owners know and love already, like Activity Zones, Garage Door Alerts, Familiar Face Alerts, and now there’s intelligent alerts," the website adds.</p><p>The renders of the indoor cam show that it is wired and is expected to come in three colors: Snow, Berry, and Hazel.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zCJAyKaEZHWppcZcezhaFM" name="google-tv-streamer-with-nest-cam-hands-on.jpg" alt="Google TV Streamer with Nest Cam" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zCJAyKaEZHWppcZcezhaFM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Instead of launching a third-gen wireless outdoor cam, Google is reportedly working on a second-gen wired camera. It could show up with features similar to the Nest indoor cam, meaning 2K HDR, 6x Zoom, as well as focus areas, Zoom, and Crop features will show up on this one as well. As for colors, the leak claims that we'll see two colorways: Snow and Hazel.</p><p>Furthermore, the new third-gen<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-nest-doorbell-aware-subscription-limitations-hello-rename"> Nest doorbell</a> will also have all the above features as the new Nest cams; however, it could get a new feature called "Daily summaries," which is expected to give you a recap of all your recorded events, like a quick wrap of your day, with the help of Gemini.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZuXbHA2ktii4vFUyvnXzMC" name="doorbell-3.jpg" alt="Google Nest doorbell" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZuXbHA2ktii4vFUyvnXzMC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Lastly, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/leak-suggests-googles-mystery-smart-speaker-may-debut-in-four-colors">mystery speaker</a> that we spotted during the Pixel 10 launch will also show <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/leak-suggests-googles-mystery-smart-speaker-may-debut-in-four-colors">up in four colors</a>, looking like a bulkier version of the Nest Mini, which will also be pumped with Gemini.  And it is supposedly being called the "Google Home Speaker."</p><p>While earlier leaks have talked about the design and security features of this smart speaker, this leak talks about its audio. Rumor has it that it will get a  "360-degree sound and has balanced audio, so it’s going to sound very good, despite its small size. Additionally, you can pair it with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/you-can-play-retro-games-on-practically-anything">Google TV Streamer,</a>" the publication added.</p><p>That said, Google might be allegedly renaming its paid Nest subscription to "Google Home Premium" and a second plan called "Google Home Premium Advanced," but details about the pricing still remain unknown.</p> ]]></dc:content>

While the Android System Key Verifier is the backbone of this, 9to5 states beta testers should find a "Security & Privacy" sub-menu when tapping "verify encryption" in one of your RCS messaging threads.</p><p>When going to verify, the post notes that users should notice a "verify keys for this contact" pop-up, which literally holds the key to your strengthened RCS chat safety. A prominent "Your QR Code" button sits in the center of this sub-menu, above which app/phone number the code will help verify and secure. The QR code works both ways, as users will need to have their contact scan the one on their phone and vice versa.</p><p>Alternatively, users can compare verification codes, which is pretty much the only thing you'd find currently in the Messages app if you were to verify chats.</p><p>The publication's testing also showed that the Android System Key Verifier will initiate scanning, and with a colorful viewfinder, at that.</p><h2 id="make-sure-it-s-the-right-person-2">Make sure it's the right person</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:265px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:226.42%;"><img id="9JKUp9r87exaGGCMFcEt3g" name="google-messages-qr-codes-key-verifier-beta-example" alt="An example of Google Messages' latest beta, which reportedly brings its new QR code-based verified keys to better protect RCS chats." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9JKUp9r87exaGGCMFcEt3g.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="265" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We first heard about Google supposedly working on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-new-app-secures-your-chats-with-a-twist">an improved way to verify</a> your RCS chats back in November. The Android System Key Verifier is the catalyst behind all this, arriving as an app (that should already be on your device) capable of locking down your RCS chats with encryption keys. As 9to5 notes, Google's explainer about these keys says that they "help ensure only you and your contact can read the RCS messages you send each other."</p><p>Those keys are then shared via the QR codes that you and your friend/family member scan on each other's phones.</p><p>Last fall, it was rumored that these QR codes help to identify one another, ensuring that only you and the one you're texting have access to those messages. It was also stated that this feature would only work on devices running Android 10 or newer. Additionally, the real possibility of someone purchasing a new phone was highlighted.</p><p>If that happens, likely, the verification keys won't match anymore, pushing users to repeat the QR code scanning process. Since the feature's just been spotted in beta, we might be a couple of months away from it arriving. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-qpr2-beta-1-is-here">Android 16's QPR2 Beta 1</a> just dropped, maybe we're looking at that launch timeframe for this Messages feature around then, which would be toward December if anything.</p> ]]></dc:content>

In a lengthy interview with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-08-21/google-pixel-10-future-of-pixel-google-glasses-interview-with-rick-osterloh">Bloomberg</a>, Osterloh said the Pixel lineup improves by "about 30% each year." Despite that, he says that this year's launch is a “super strong release” in a “mature category.” Bloomberg says that the company has pretty much hit a "plateau when it comes to the design of the device, much like Apple."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="7bosknD7AGHCZkXkxpMiGn" name="google-pixel-10-pro-and-pro-XL-all-colors-03" alt="All colors of the Google Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL line with a "PIXEL" sign behind them" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7bosknD7AGHCZkXkxpMiGn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>But the Chief Design Officer for consumer devices at Google, Ivy Ross, disagreed and said that visual changes are in the cards for Pixel devices. “Every two to three years, we look to try and do something with a new design language,” she said.</p><p>Ross also notes that Google is already finalizing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-11">Pixel 11 series,</a> set to launch in 2026, and has started working on the 2027 lineup of devices as well. Earlier this year, we were privy to some rumors about the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/these-are-the-rumored-google-pixel-12-codenames-for-every-model"> Pixel 12 lineup </a>and its internal codenames, but nothing yet about the phones' design.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XHQDoAAVmF4AGKFv46mV9U" name="Google-Pixels" alt="Google Pixel through the years" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XHQDoAAVmF4AGKFv46mV9U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That said, while there may not be visual design changes in this model, Osterloh added that the real "change" in devices might show up in the software side of things, as we noticed in this year's lineup as well. Google relied heavily on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-pixel-10-magic-cue-with-in-context-suggestions-ai-details">Gemini and other AI tools </a>to up the ante on the Pixel 10 devices, with subtle hardware changes here and there.</p><p>"AI will become the way you interface with a phone to get something done,” Osterloh said. “That will then start to influence the design of it.”</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MGgJMpGsHFVCmBmMPTwh9X" name="Google-Pixel-10-daily-hub" alt="Pixel 10d" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MGgJMpGsHFVCmBmMPTwh9X.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Looking into the future, Osterloh says that we will definitely see more of this AI integration in its ecosystem, especially on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/my-demo-with-googles-ar-glasses-went-better-than-the-one-on-stage">XR Glasses</a> and foldables front. However, he reiterates the uncertainty on whether or not Google itself will release glasses again, saying it is still "TBD" (to be decided).</p><p>Finally, Shakil Barkat, VP, devices and services at Google, pretty much confirmed that Google won't be pursuing a flip phone or a smart ring anytime soon. Additionally, it has temporarily halted its plans for its upcoming tablets. The company is rethinking the role tablets will play in the future until it finds a "meaningful future" for the category, according to Bloomberg. Hinting at the fact that the rumors about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/pixel-tablet-2-alleged-changes-upgrades-report">Pixel Tablet 2 being cancelled</a> might indeed be true.</p> ]]></dc:content>

On the other end of the spectrum, Sonos Ace are my favorite headphones to wear for comfort, although it feels like I'm compromising on sound quality and ANC at times.</p><p>I've been waiting for a pair of over-ear headphones to come along that strike a better balance between comfort, ANC, and sound quality. After about two weeks of testing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/sony-wh-1000xm6-review">Sony WH-1000XM6</a>, I think they finally fit the bill. They're more comfortable than AirPods Max, better sounding with stronger ANC than <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sonos-ace-review">Sonos Ace</a>, and have a best-in-class wired mode with a 3.5mm cable in the box.</p><p>Here's why the Sony WH-1000XM6 headphones are streamlining my audio listening experience by replacing a few pairs with a universal solution.</p><h2 id="sonos-ace-still-beat-the-sony-s-in-design-and-comfort-2">Sonos Ace still beat the Sony's in design and comfort</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7yKeVYrPZkkwZtiVx32NSA" name="Sony-WH1000XM6-vs-Sonos-Ace-4" alt="The Sonos Ace in white beside the Sony WH-1000XM6 in black." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7yKeVYrPZkkwZtiVx32NSA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>First off, let's give Sonos its flowers. The Sonos Ace are still the most comfortable pair of over-ears I've ever used, and they may have the best design on the market today. The oval-shaped ear cups are clean, the memory foam ear cushions are comfy, and the metal accents are premium.</p><p>I don't think the Sony WH-1000XM6 feel as fancy, but Sony's choice to go with plastic parts helps with weight — they're significantly lighter at 254 grams than the 312-gram Sonos Ace.</p><p>I have no issue with Sony's use of plastic; in fact, I think Apple's avoidance of plastic is severely holding the AirPods Max back. However, the matte finish on the WH-1000XM6 and the questionable ear and headband cushions could use work. Fingerprints and skin oils will make the Sony headphones look gross, seemingly out of the box. The cushions seem to wear easily, retaining their shape less than my year-old Sonos Ace.</p><h2 id="the-sony-wh-1000xm6-have-better-anc-and-sound-quality-than-sonos-ace-2">The Sony WH-1000XM6 have better ANC and sound quality than Sonos Ace</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HAoUx59WbxfXFUfqejB7HA" name="Sony-WH1000XM6-vs-Sonos-Ace-2" alt="The Sonos Ace in white beside the Sony WH-1000XM6 in black." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HAoUx59WbxfXFUfqejB7HA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Sound quality and active noise-canceling (ANC) on the Sonos Ace are passable, but it won't blow you away for the price. The more I use Sonos' ANC, the more I become overwhelmed. On a recent flight, I noticed some distracting static noise in one of the Sonos Ace earcups — more distracting and painful than the airplane turbulence I was trying to block out. It turns out, I'm not alone, as this issue only popped up recently for me, but it is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/1da5xhh/sonos_ace_static_noise/" target="_blank">well-documented on Reddit</a>.</p><p>While I have no issues with the sound of Sonos' 40mm drivers powering the Ace, the static problems occurring with ANC finally pushed me to consider a switch. Luckily, my Sony WH-1000XM6 review loaner came in shortly after, and the difference was stark. The Sony headphones block out noise better than the Sonos Ace, with no static or hissing sounds to boot.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2jjiZounXPtzLYNqxmwJn9" name="Sony-WH1000XM6-vs-Sonos-Ace-3" alt="The Sonos Ace in white beside the Sony WH-1000XM6 in black." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2jjiZounXPtzLYNqxmwJn9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Static sounds aside, which might go away after a firmware update, there are a few reasons why ANC might be stronger on the Sony WH-1000XM6 than the Sonos Ace. For one, Sony equipped the WH-1000XM6 with 12 microphones compared to eight on the Ace. There's also a new QN3 processor specifically tasked with ANC on the WH-1000XM6.</p><p>However, I think the most impactful factor might be the seal that Sony's WH-1000XM6 create with your head while listening to music. These headphones have a higher clamping force than the Sonos Ace, and the ear cushion material feels like it "sticks" to the side of your head to make a solid seal. Meanwhile, the vegan leather ear cushions on the Sonos Ace — while comfy — don't create the same experience.</p><p>All told, I like the sound quality of the Sony's a bit more than the Sonos Ace. Music sounds louder and fuller without losing crispness or clarity, and the out-of-the-box sound signature is excellent.</p><h2 id="sony-s-wired-headphone-mode-is-better-than-sonos-2">Sony's wired headphone mode is better than Sonos'</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WddBZaxVsF7ssdhPHXuSmA" name="Sony-WH1000XM6-vs-Sonos-Ace-5" alt="The Sonos Ace in white beside the Sony WH-1000XM6 in black." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WddBZaxVsF7ssdhPHXuSmA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Sonos supports wired mode on the Ace using both the USB-C port and 3.5mm jack, whereas Sony only supports the latter. This doesn't tell the whole story. When you use the Sonos Ace with a cable, you're bypassing the headphones' internal DAC and using the one in your device. As it turns out, the Sonos Ace are quite difficult to drive, so your phone or media player will probably struggle to deliver great volume with a cable.</p><p>In my experience using Sonos Ace wired with various <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> and an iPod, I'd get roughly half the volume that I would using Bluetooth.</p><p>The Sony WH-1000XM6 stands out in this area, producing an even louder music listening experience with a cable. I don't think they sound as good with the included 3.5mm cable as they do wirelessly, likely for the same reason that the Sonos Ace sound quiet in wired mode — both bypass the headphones' DACs. But the WH-1000XM6 seem to be easy to drive, making the Sony's a better fit for wired use.</p><h2 id="until-we-get-a-sonos-ace-2-i-m-sticking-with-sony-2">Until we get a Sonos Ace 2, I'm sticking with Sony</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FBitYLtecjDo67qKDgQeoR" name="Sony-WH1000XM6-vs-Sonos-Ace-6" alt="The Sony WH-1000XM6 in front of the Sonos Ace on a park bench." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FBitYLtecjDo67qKDgQeoR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Sonos Ace are starting to prove that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">best headphones</a> can't be great on design and comfort alone.

If used the right way, it could make photography more approachable to the masses.</p><h2 id="how-camera-coach-works-2">How Camera Coach works</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="T8qNdg3XS2SSrdP2ifBJXX" name="Google-Pixel-10-Camera-Coach-1" alt="Camera Coach on the Pixel 10" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/T8qNdg3XS2SSrdP2ifBJXX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Camera Coach is a generative AI tool that is debuting in preview alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/which-google-pixel-10-model-should-you-buy">Google Pixel 10 lineup</a>. It's powered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">custom Gemini models</a> tuned for photography tips. While some of this may run on-device, a disclaimer notes that "when you use Camera Coach, the contents of the scene will be sent to Google for processing and then deleted."</p><p>Offloading some of the AI processing from your phone to Google's cloud servers isn't new or surprising. It comes with benefits, like saving your phone's battery life for things you actually need. However, you might want to consider what you share with Camera Coach for privacy reasons, even if the content is deleted from Google's servers eventually.</p><p>Camera Coach is turned off by default. When enabled, it uses AI models to analyze the scene you're trying to capture with contextual awareness. After it understands the scene, Camera Coach makes suggestions to aspects of the shot, like composition, framing, and lighting. All this is happening before you capture the photo, putting the photographer in complete control.</p><h2 id="camera-coach-makes-skilled-photography-accessible-to-all-2">Camera Coach makes skilled photography accessible to all</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="7xrqHePPnRBqU8js7BGC3a" name="google-pixel-10-Pro-camera-coach-montage" alt="Testing out the Camera Coach functionality on a Google Pixel 10 Pro to take an "artistic" picture of a potted plant" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7xrqHePPnRBqU8js7BGC3a.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'm naturally adverse to letting AI creep into creativity and the arts, but let's be honest, photography isn't exactly an accessible craft. I own a Sony a6400 mirrorless camera for work and a bit of play, although I wouldn't call myself a great photographer. The cost of a great camera like that one is a huge barrier to entry, and <em>learning</em> how to use it is another major undertaking. It's one that I admittedly haven't spent the time to do yet.</p><p>This premise is what changed my mind about Camera Coach after initially being wary of the feature. Photography is a hard skill to learn, and not everyone has the time to learn it. We've all heard expressions like "it's the photographer, not the camera that makes the photo" — and they're all true. That's exactly why there's a need for something like Camera Coach to exist.</p><p>Smartphones already serve as excellent cameras, and they're so good that now the skills of smartphone <em>users</em> are what need to be improved, rather than specs.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="dCBzuZt2iV29kzuCjxtM4i" name="google-pixel-10-blue-camera-coach-01" alt="Using Camera Coach on a blue Google Pixel 10 to take a picture of a potted plant" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dCBzuZt2iV29kzuCjxtM4i.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>AI might be a better photography instructor on the fly, using real-world scenes to teach <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-hands-on">Pixel 10</a> users about principles such as composition or lighting. Camera Coach can suggest changes like moving the subject or using optical zoom to the photographer's advantage. It can even come up with brand-new shot ideas simply from viewing your surroundings.</p><p>If you're a photography nerd, you've probably grimaced looking at photos captured with smartphones by your friends and family. You know that angling the camera lens a degree up or down could've made the photo so much better — but they don't. Camera Coach sure sounds like a solution to this problem, as it's effectively a photography instructor you can put in your pocket.</p><h2 id="camera-coach-is-only-great-if-you-learn-from-it-2">Camera Coach is only great if you learn from it</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FuzswB8xGzLu9gG92DEpYY" name="Google-Pixel-10-Camera-Coach-4" alt="Camera Coach on the Pixel 10" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FuzswB8xGzLu9gG92DEpYY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If Camera Coach makes photography more accessible to the masses, I'm all for it.

I'd love to see <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a> users try out Camera Coach for, say, a month. After that, those same users have ideally learned enough to start applying Camera Coach principles on their own.</p><p>I'd be lying if I said I wasn't worried about people using Camera Coach as a crutch rather than a learning tool. In that case, we could <em>lose</em> skills thanks to AI, rather than <em>learn</em> them. Camera Coach isn't inherently bad — in fact, it might be great — but it's up to us to use it the right way.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="db32385f-67a2-4a40-aadd-b710980ba083">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GDvuEpuneFYQKQMvgu3z7C.jpg' alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro in Moonstone"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 10 Pro</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The best Pixel for photos</strong></em></p><p>The Google Pixel 10 Pro is the brand-new Pixel phone you should be looking at if you want to take great photos.

It comes with a durability rating of IP68 and 5ATM water resistance, which means it's fine for shallow waters, beaches, or pools, but not for activities involving high-velocity or high-temperature water. </p><p>Google also notes water resistance may decrease over time with wear and tear, and the ratings shouldn't be considered permanent. Even some bands are not water-resistant.

This means the watch is durable enough to survive up to 10 minutes at depths of 50 meters and up to 30 minutes at depths of 1.5 meters.</p><p>Google notes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/google-pixel-watch-4-hands-on">Pixel Watch 4</a> is designed for shallow water, so it should be fine for occasional use in pools and on beaches.</p><p>The 5ATM water resistance means you could use your Pixel Watch 4 while snorkeling or diving, but it shouldn't really be used for those cases since it isn't as durable as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-2">Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-never-expected-to-love-apple-watch-ultra-2-so-much">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>, which come with higher 10ATM protection.</p><p>Google even warns that the Pixel Watch 4 shouldn't be immersed in water for more than 24 hours and shouldn't be used for activities involving water at high velocity or temperature.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kS99fiaK5FEwfGDQh3yarb" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-4-and-Pixel-Watch-3-1" alt="Pixel Watch 4 (left) next to the Pixel Watch 3 (right)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kS99fiaK5FEwfGDQh3yarb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's also worth noting that some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/watch-bands/best-google-pixel-watch-4-bands">Pixel Watch 4 bands</a> are not water resistant, so you should check before using them in water, and the company adds that you should dry the watch after exposure to any liquid.</p><p>In addition to being water-resistant, the Pixel Watch 4 is also dust-resistant, meaning it's durable enough against sand from the beach or mud, and it shouldn't get inside the watch's case.</p><p>All this means that while you can swim and use your Pixel Watch 4 in pools to track exercise, you shouldn't push it too much, as there's always a chance of water entering the watch.</p><p>Lastly, it's also worth noting that the Pixel Watch 4 doesn't come with a MIL-STD-810H rating, meaning it's not protected against drops or impacts.

Phones are one of those things that start to lose value the minute you buy them, but that doesn't mean they don't work as well as a brand-new one will. Everyone likes to save a little money.</p><p>Next up is the software, and this goes extra hard for a Google Pixel. A quick look across the internet will show you a mountain of people expressing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-users-late-start-alarm-issues-reported">issues they were having with the last Pixel phone</a> when it was brand new. Give it a few months, and most of those are all ironed out via software updates. I hate to say Google releases things that aren't quite ready (it does), but you interpret that however you like.</p><p>This alone doesn't mean the Pixel 9 is still a good value today, but I think it is for a lot of people. The software will be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-9-software-updates">updated longer than the battery will last</a>, and there are no real red flags here. I've used one for a while and all I can say bad about it is that it gets too hot while it's charging.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-pros"><span>The Pros</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="a3XUyNhNPt2FimnuKekd6J" name="Google-Pixel-9-Pixel-9-Pro-all-colors.jpg" alt="Holding all the different colors of the Google Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a3XUyNhNPt2FimnuKekd6J.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Shruti Shekar / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The list of pros and cons for any sort of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-vs-pixel-9">Pixel 9 versus Pixel 10</a> match-up isn't going to be very long. You'll get a phone that works a certain way without any real spectacular new hardware features to make a big difference. They are there, though, and every little bit helps.</p><p>The biggest pro is, of course, <strong>the price</strong>. I don't know why exactly, but the Google Pixel is one of those phones that sells well enough but is still <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/call-off-the-search-verizon-has-the-google-pixel-10-pro-deal-to-beat">always on sale somewhere</a>. Google isn't trying to get rid of millions of extra stock, yet these phones show up on sale in plenty of places.</p><p>The Pixel 10 will be the same way, and that can be a big part of deciding which to buy. If the price is the same, pick the newer model. But the price won't be the same. We will see the Pixel 9 price cut a few times before all the stock is gone, and the used market will be around a lot longer if that's how you roll.</p><p>Another thing people always think about is the latest <strong>software features</strong> that debut on the new Pixel phone. The thing is, most of those are going to come to the Pixel 9 as well. That's another thing we see every year; the software kind of trickles down to all the models that can run it.</p><p>There will be features announced for the Pixel 10 that never come to the Pixel 9. I guess that some of the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/live/made-by-google-live-blog-2025-pixel-10-pixel-watch-4-android-16-and-gemini">AI camera "stuff"</a> will be some of them. Maybe I'm wrong here, though, because Google builds its tensor processor to crunch AI algorithms. If it can do other phone things too, that's a plus. The Pixel is Google's way to showcase the way it bakes AI into everyday software. The company <em>wants</em> you to use it.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-cons"><span>The cons</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5712px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="v9UQgzBZP4Q8npDpBif2DS" name="Google-Pixel-10-all-hues" alt="Google Pixel 10 all colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v9UQgzBZP4Q8npDpBif2DS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5712" height="3213" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are a few good reasons to buy the new Pixel 10 instead.</p><p><strong>The price of a Pixel phone isn't crazy high. </strong>That's a big deal, and it means the price difference may not be that much once all the sales and deals kick in.

You'll need to cough up $1,199 to preorder a Pixel 10 Pro XL from Google.</p><p>You probably won't buy it from Google, though, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/best-google-pixel-10-deals">Pixel 10 deals</a> are already out there. Once it shows up on the shelves and the prices are mostly settled, you won't be spending a bunch of extra money if you decide to get the newer Pixel 10.</p><p>Next are the <strong>software features</strong>. Both a pro and a con, which is weird, but it makes sense in this case. Most of the new software features, especially the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini-based</a> ones, will end up on the Pixel 9. Most is not all, though. If you really want to make sure you can use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Camera Coach</a> (something that really impressed me, which is hard to do), you need to buy a Pixel 10.</p><p>Finally comes <strong>the hardware bump</strong>. The Pixel 9 uses Google's Tensor G4 processor, and the Pixel 10 has jumped up the the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/im-surprised-that-im-this-excited-for-the-pixel-10-pro-fold">Tensor G5. </a>Neither is ever going to match up with the best from Qualcomm or Apple in any area but one: AI processing. That's what Google focuses on, and they build what works best for their business model.</p><p>I've not used a Pixel 10 enough to know what the difference is, but it probably will handle some of those "phone things" a little better. Unfortunately, nobody can tell you today how well the Pixel 10 will perform, only that it's expected to be better than the Pixel 9.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-my-verdict"><span>My verdict</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tyizFyyCo9bH2zWLakd4Yk" name="Court-gavel-lawsuits.jpg" alt="Court Gavel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tyizFyyCo9bH2zWLakd4Yk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Don't buy anything right now.

Those sources claim that Meta has inked a deal with Google for $10 billion, and that this deal is a "six-year" contract that involves the use of the latter's cloud services. It's been reported that Meta will be able to leverage Google's cloud-based storage, networking, servers, and "other services."</p><p>Reuters' source didn't go into more detail about the Meta, Google deal. However, the post states <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/meta-signs-10-billion-plus-cloud-deal-google">The Information</a> first broke the news about this development, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/21/google-scores-six-year-meta-cloud-deal-worth-over-10-billion.html">CNBC</a> promptly expanded on soon after.</p><p>It seems that Meta is extremely interested in widening the range of its AI infrastructure. It's likely Meta's interest in Google's wide-arching cloud services is to build a more solid base as it pushes ahead with more prominent ambitions in AI. So far, Google and Meta have declined to comment on the recent reports.</p><h2 id="meta-s-serious-about-ai-2">Meta's serious about AI</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="25Smt57wtdQWZbbPCxUj7H" name="meta-quest-hero.jpg" alt="Meta Quest Hero" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/25Smt57wtdQWZbbPCxUj7H.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1536" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As CNBC noted, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/metas-q2-earnings-continue-to-soar-as-ai-fuels-its-ad-revenue">Meta's recent Q2 2025 earnings</a> report highlighted the company's plans for increased spending regarding its AI plans this year. The earnings report late in July highlighted Meta's soaring 22% increase in revenue, year-over-year (YoY), to $47.52 billion. Its growth significantly outpaced many expectations for it last quarter. However, it was stated that this increase was largely attributed to Meta's AI-powered advertising.</p><p>Meta's CEO Mark Zuckerberg commented, stating the platform's AI-based ads have helped users "stay on its platforms" and have continued to display "strong engagement." It was also mentioned that Meta has been more aggressively chasing more AI chances in the industry, as it pushes to create "super intelligence," which Zuckerberg states is "AI that surpasses human intelligence in every way we think, is now in sight."</p><p>So far, Meta has spent roughly $17.01 billion in building new AI infrastructure, such as data centers and funding for advanced research. More than that, Meta is expected to boost its available revenue, anywhere from $66 billion to $72 billion in 2025. This is reportedly a $30 billion increase compared to 2024.</p> ]]></dc:content>

As expected, AYANEO stopped short of revealing everything about the Pocket Fit Elite, but just going by the name, this might be the first handheld to be powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TCS04Y2jniI" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>For reference, the KONKR Pocket Fit makes use of the Snapdragon G3 Gen 3, which is the same chip found in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/ayaneo-pocket-s2-and-s2-pro-pre-orders-are-now-open-with-shipping-to-begin-soon">AYANEO Pocket S2</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/gdc-2025-brings-about-new-qualcomm-chips-and-android-gaming-handhelds">ONEXSUGAR Sugar 1</a>.

Initially, teaser images suggested the former would be priced around $369. Subsequent posts have continued lowering that number, as it now sits at $329.

As the "Lite" tag entails, this new Tab S10 tablet entry should sit a little lower than the rest of the series, while attempting to bridge the gap between that lower cost and the AI capabilities Samsung is bringing. To begin, Samsung states the Tab S10 Lite features a 10.9-inch screen, similar to the company's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-fe-and-s10-fe-plus-launched">Galaxy Tab S10 FE</a>.</p><p>The post states the tablet's display is "perfect for streaming, browsing, and more" and that it can reach 600nits of peak brightness. While that's not incredibly bright, Samsung states the Tab S10 Lite produces less blue light emissions, meaning it should help reduce overall eye fatigue over long periods.</p><p>Samsung's executive vice president and head of its R&D team, Changtae Kim, states, "The new Galaxy Tab S10 Lite is designed to bring practical, everyday functionality to more people around the world."</p><h2 id="ai-even-if-it-s-lite-2">AI even if it's Lite</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:664px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.27%;"><img id="o44nU7bP8JqHoBx7mjRbEo" name="samsung-galaxy-s10-lite-official" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Lite promo material, displaying the device in gray with a white S Pen." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o44nU7bP8JqHoBx7mjRbEo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="664" height="440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With that, the company gets into AI, which seems to have quite a presence, even on the lower Lite model. Samsung is keeping its S Pen present on the Tab S10 Lite, giving users access to its convenient Handwriting Assist when scribbling down notes throughout the day. Elsewhere on the tablet, users will find <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-gemini-more-in-store-android-samsung-unpacked">Circle to Search's capabilities</a>, so you can look up anything you're curious about from anywhere on the device.</p><p>Samsung highlights the Tab S10 Lite's support of several third-party apps, like Goodnotes, Clip Studio Paint, LumaFusion, and more. Many of these embody creativity and productivity, which is exactly where Samsung hopes to lean its Tab S10 Lite. More importantly, the upcoming tablet's Book Cover keyboard features a Galaxy AI Key. This is likely similar to the accessory consumers would find available<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/mobile-accessories/tablets/book-cover-keyboard-slim-ai-key-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-s10-ultra-5g-s9-ultra-s9-ultra-5g-ef-dx920ubeguj/"> for the Tab S10 Ultra</a>.</p><p>The AI key is a quick one-tap helper for AI assistance when you're drawing a blank.</p><h2 id="expected-in-september-2">Expected in September</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="hWQGjqFurzPqcXGCvJiiXR" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review-11" alt="microSD card hanging out of the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hWQGjqFurzPqcXGCvJiiXR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The last of the Galaxy Tab S10 Lite's specifications include an 8,000mAh battery with fast charging. Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-exynos-1380-launch">Exynos 1380</a> SoC, which launched in 2023, is powering most of its processes and performance capabilities. The back of it contains a singular 8MP camera, while the front features a 6MP lens.</p><p>Future consumers will also find the following RAM/storage configs: 6/128GB and 8/256GB. However, the Tab S10 Lite supports a microSD card up to 1TB.</p><p>Once again, Samsung states the Galaxy Tab S10 Lite will launch on September 4; however, its market price has not been confirmed. The Tab S10 FE launched for $499, and since the Lite moniker typically sits slightly under that, perhaps the price will dip below that, too. We'll know for sure once the Tab S10 Lite launches next month in Gray, Silver, and Coral.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The 865 is paired with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, while also being the only config available with this chip.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="46EPS4JfHUEgJJu8cGWQXA" name="ayn-thor-lifestyle-image-2" alt="AYN Thor lifestyle image" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/46EPS4JfHUEgJJu8cGWQXA.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="562" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYN)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="up38tZKtHqFgdPxFuxWQXA" name="ayn-thor-lifestyle-image-3" alt="AYN Thor lifestyle image" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/up38tZKtHqFgdPxFuxWQXA.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="562" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYN)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="X2ALKwTXB5xbp6JF7D3TXA" name="ayn-thor-lifestyle-image-4" alt="AYN Thor lifestyle image" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/X2ALKwTXB5xbp6JF7D3TXA.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="562" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYN)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>From there, AYN moves back into even more familiar territory as we see the return of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for the other AYN Thor models.

So far, the only indication that we have about the Pixel 11 Pro Fold comes via a leak in January 2025.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-hands-on">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a> builds on the success of its predecessor, which completely left the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a> in the dust. Google's latest foldable is the first of any foldable phone to feature an IP68 water and dust resistance rating, while also coming with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/google-pixelsnap-hands-on">Pixelsnap</a> via the Qi2 standard, making it compatible with magnetic phone accessories and chargers.</p><p>As the dust settles on the August 2025 "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-proved-two-things-during-its-pixel-10-announcement">Made by Google</a>" event, we're already taking a look at what the future could hold for the Pixel 11 Pro Fold.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-google-pixel-11-pro-fold-what-we-know-so-far"><span>Google Pixel 11 Pro Fold: What we know so far</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LytDXXUSV3wFonhJRunbT6" name="google-pixel-10-pro-Fold-vs-honor-magic-v5-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-03" alt="Comparing the size and thickness of the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold (light blue), Honor Magic V5 (gold/copper), and Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 (dark blue)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LytDXXUSV3wFonhJRunbT6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The aforementioned "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/exclusive-pixel-10a-pixel-11-codename-3516163/" target="_blank">leak</a>" only provided us with the codenames of the Pixel 11 lineup, with the 11 Pro Fold being internally known as "yogi" or "9YI4". On the bright side, it offers confirmation that the third-generation Pixel foldable is in development, which is a good sign for fans of Google's foldables.</p><p>More recently, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-tensor-g6-2nm-process-production-rumors" target="_blank">a report surfaced</a> claiming Google's next in-house processor, the Tensor G6, would move to a 2nm process. This is possible due to the company moving from Samsung to TSMC, and with it, building the Tensor G5 on the 3nm process.</p><p>Since its inception, Google's Tensor chips have never been able to match the power and efficiency of Qualcomm or MediaTek processors. While the Tensor G5 in the Pixel 10 lineup seemingly narrows the gap between itself and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>, it's still not <em>quite</em> on par.</p><p>The hope is that by moving to the 2nm process, Google and TSMC are able to close that gap completely, offering performance at least on par with what the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-2">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 2</a> could bring.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="T2V97MB3ThRXLxME7CiHPU" name="google-pixel-10-pro-Fold-app-pair-02" alt="Multitasking on the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold with the new save app pair feature" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/T2V97MB3ThRXLxME7CiHPU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The same leak that revealed the Pixel 11 codenames also gave us some insight as to some of the camera and AI features that are potentially on the way. Unfortunately, the Pixel 11 Pro Fold wasn't specifically mentioned, but the leak claims that some Pixel 11 devices could offer "100x zoom capabilities through Machine Learning for both photos and videos."</p><p>It's also said that Cinematic Blur could gain support for 4K 30fps recording, along with a "video relight" feature that makes it possible to "change lighting conditions in videos." This would go quite nicely with the other rumored addition, "ultra-low light video."

While that would definitely be nice, it's not a trend that Google should follow if it means losing out on battery life and the IP68 rating of the Pixel 10 Pro Fold.</p><p>Instead, we're hoping to see hardware parity between Google's foldable phones and its slab phones, specifically regarding the camera. When looking at the Pixel 10 Pro Fold and 10 Pro XL, both phones are equipped with triple rear camera setups, covering all of the bases for what you might want to take pictures of.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GHCR7583oPKa4aTLQSK77G" name="google-pixel-10-pro-XL-moonstone-obsidian-pixelsnap-ring-03" alt="A Google Pixelsnap ring attached to the back of the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL via Qi2 magnets" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GHCR7583oPKa4aTLQSK77G.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>However, the Pixel 10 Pro XL includes an updated camera array, headlined by a 50MP primary lens, paired with a 48MP telephoto lens and 48MP ultrawide sensor. In comparison, the 10 Pro Fold sports a 48MP primary sensor, accompanied by 10.5MP telephoto and 10.5MP ultrawide cameras.

He addressed the challenges of porting Wear OS software to a new platform like RISC-V, while confirming they are still "working on it" with Google.</p><p>This year, of course, we got the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/snapdragon-w5-gen-2-revealed-with-satellite-sos-but-no-major-power-boost">Snapdragon W5 Gen 2</a>, which kept the same last-gen Cortex cores for unchanged performance, but added new tools like satellite messaging and enhanced GPS accuracy.

It's hard to predict which path Google will take.</p><p>Chipset aside, we don't know too much else about the Watch 5.

Without this, the Pixel Watch 4 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/the-pixel-watch-4-would-be-my-go-to-fitness-smartwatch-if-google-added-this-feature">harder to recommend to gym-goers</a> because the only useful data you'll get is general cardio load and burned calories.</p><p>The Pixel Watch 4 did improve in key areas, adding new sports modes like basketball and pickleball, and letting you project your cycling stats onto your phone. But other brands offer more sports modes than its current 50+. And for runners and hikers specifically, I'd still like to see a method to create a route in Google Maps, download it to your watch, and then follow the course with turn-by-turn directions during the workout.</p><h2 id="thin-out-that-thicc-body-or-go-all-in-on-battery-life-2">Thin out that thicc body or go all-in on battery life</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5712px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oY7Vkii8eXHTi75zBeEfr6" name="Pixel-Watch-4-all-colors" alt="Pixel Watch 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oY7Vkii8eXHTi75zBeEfr6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5712" height="3213" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Even if you see it as a feature rather than a flaw, the Pixel Watch 4 design is the roundest you'll ever see on a smartwatch. And as striking as it might be, it looks even thicker now that Google added the domed Actua 360 display.</p><p>Even though people have scoffed at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-review">Galaxy Watch 8</a>'s chunky squircle design, its "cushion design" helped Samsung make it quite skinny and light. I'm curious if Google can keep its distinctive edgeless look but also make it bulge out slightly less from our wrists.</p><p>Android Central managing editor, Derrek Lee, who performed the Watch 4 hands-on, said that he "wants it to be thinner, but if it's gonna be thicc, at least give us some OnePlus Watch 3-level battery life."

It represents the evolution of Google mainly as a service and software provider to a company that delivers the full stack of products, including brilliant hardware.</p><p>The Pixel 11 might not be on the horizon for many months to come, but we've already seen rumblings of what might be, from interviews mentioning the design to what's in store for the next generation of Tensor processors. The Pixel 11 could end up being a major release for Google.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-google-pixel-11-what-we-know-so-far"><span>Google Pixel 11: What we know so far</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JZvHii3548aQd2CNXFX6X5" name="google-pixel-10-vs-10-pro-obsidian-back-01" alt="Comparing the obsidian colorsways of the Google Pixel 10 with the obsidian Google Pixel 10 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JZvHii3548aQd2CNXFX6X5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Last year, Google revamped the Pixel's "friendlier" design and replaced it with something people have called "sleek" and "clean." Some of us at Android Central haven't been crazy about the clear iPhone design leanings of this generation, though, and an interview <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-08-21/google-pixel-10-future-of-pixel-google-glasses-interview-with-rick-osterloh">Bloomberg</a> conducted with Google's Senior Vice President of Devices & Services, Rick Osterloh.</p><p>In the interview, Bloomberg revealed that Google aims to give Pixels a design refresh every 2-3 years, which lines up perfectly with what we've seen from the company in the past. Pixels 1-3 shared a design language, Pixels 4-5 looked similar to each other, and Pixels 6-8 all had their unique design traits that felt like a clear generational delination.</p><p>That leaves the Pixel 11's design a bit up in the air. With Google confirming that designs last 2-3 years, we could be on the cusp of yet another big redesign in just a year, or we may have to wait one more year to see things change. Either way, there's going to be some kind of tweak happening next year, even if it's not a complete design refresh.</p><h2 id="sim-vs-esim-2">SIM vs eSIM</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GHCR7583oPKa4aTLQSK77G" name="google-pixel-10-pro-XL-moonstone-obsidian-pixelsnap-ring-03" alt="A Google Pixelsnap ring attached to the back of the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL via Qi2 magnets" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GHCR7583oPKa4aTLQSK77G.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Part of this year's design changes included "even cleaner" lines in the U.S. models because they lack a physical SIM tray. Many users have expressed outrage at the move, while others simply don't care. Regardless of personal opinion on physical versus digital, the lack of a physical SIM card slot is a legitimate deterrent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/USMobile/comments/1mw1i0t/comment/n9vzfa5/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">for some users</a>.</p><p>It's highly unlikely that Google will go back to having a physical SIM slot in U.S. models of the Pixel 11. One reason is that the company was able to completely remove the mmWave "pill" on the Pixel 10's frame by putting it in the position where the physical SIM tray is on some global models.</p><p>Carriers like Verizon use mmWave in the U.S. for their 5G networks, so this isn't likely to change with the Pixel 11. Conversely, many smartphone users globally rely on physical SIMs because they're easy to use when traveling, don't require internet connectivity for activation, allow users to easily use prepaid phones and carriers, and offer plenty of other benefits over eSIM.</p><h2 id="a-new-tensor-chip-2">A new Tensor chip</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7VRynWNu5EaptSUgniwKqW" name="Google-Pixel-10-hands-on-display-Material-3-Expressive" alt="Pixel 10d" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7VRynWNu5EaptSUgniwKqW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Tensor G6 is the processor likely to be at the heart of the Pixel 11, and it's rumored that this will be a significant leap for the company's in-house processors. Tensor G5 is Google's first Tensor chip <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/im-surprised-that-im-this-excited-for-the-pixel-10-pro-fold">not manufactured by Samsung</a>, and it meant the processor got a sizable 35% performance improvement over the sluggish Tensor G4 in the Pixel 9 series.</p><p>Tensor G6 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-tensor-g6-2nm-process-production-rumors">is rumored to switch</a> to an even more efficient 2nm manufacturing process, meaning it could be closer in performance to Qualcomm's chipsets than ever. Tensor has often been as slow as four-year-old phones, and while Tensor G5 trades blows with one-year-old phones, Tensor G6 might finally match the performance of 2026's models.</p><p>Additionally, Google is reportedly looking into baking a bunch of new health-related features into Tensor G6 for breathing, sleep apnea, gait analysis, and more. Additionally, Tensor G6 is said to be able to efficiently generate video using AI algorithms, so all those <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-hands-on">fancy new photo tricks</a> we saw this year may turn into fancy new video tricks for the Pixel 11.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-we-want-to-see"><span>What we want to see</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5712px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="mfhAhmuXkqA4pUEyQXkwCD" name="Pixel-10-Pro-all-hues" alt="Pixel 10 Pro in all shades" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mfhAhmuXkqA4pUEyQXkwCD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5712" height="3213" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This year marked another display spec upgrade for the Pixel 10, and that included <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-new-pwm-accessibility-setting">a new accessibility feature</a> to help PWM-sensitive users like myself. The problem, if you've been keeping up with display tech, is that Google's new setting doesn't go far enough to help sensitive users.</p><p>The Pixel 10 gives users the choice between 240Hz and 480Hz PWM rates, but PWM-sensitive users need PWM rates in the <em>thousands</em> of hertz, not the hundreds.

While we applaud Google for the progress it has made in recording quality, much of the best quality video from Pixels only happens after it's been uploaded to Google's cloud and given additional processing.</p><p>We'd love to see the Pixel be able to do this <em>on the phone</em> instead of needing to upload it to a cloud server and requiring a more expensive phone or subscription to get the job done.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5nLhPR4gCZ237BcaMf3e9Q" name="google-pixel-10-wireless-qi2-charging-dock-02" alt="The official Google Pixelsnap Qi2 wireless charger and dock for the Google Pixel 10 series" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5nLhPR4gCZ237BcaMf3e9Q.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Pixel 10 features the biggest batteries in any Pixel phone to date, a trend that's continued for several years as Google tries to get away from the stigma of Pixels being slow and having poor battery life.

We also want to see much faster charging for the smaller Pixel 11 phones, as the Pixel 10 Pro XL is still the only model that charges faster than 30W.</p><p>Google made huge strides with the Pixel 10, and we're excited to see the company further improve pain points on its line, as well as further differentiate Pixel phones from the rest of the smartphone pack with bespoke AI features and very Google-like style.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="610ab127-0db2-43e1-b588-ef81e0966f0b">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/APdDaw44aSpsKffhWU53s9.jpg' alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL in Moonstone"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 10 Pro XL</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The fastest-charging Pixel</strong></em></p><p>The Pixel 10 Pro XL is the fastest-charging Google phone ever, supporting 39W speeds with a cable and 25W wirelessly.

Current Pixel Watch owners have until the October 9 launch to decide whether to trade in their current model, and while there's plenty to tempt them, not everyone should.</p><p>Our favorite <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/this-is-the-best-pixel-watch-4-deal-weve-spotted-so-far">Watch 4 trade-in deal</a> gives you $200 in credit for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3</a> or $95 for a Watch 2. That's solid value for a standard model, but you won't get extra credit for a 45mm or LTE trade-in, and you're still looking at a decently hefty price tag if you want those upgrades again.</p><p>My job isn't to sell you on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Pixel Watch 4</a>; it's to hone in on what's changed that you might find compelling, versus the trumped-up new features or unchanged Watch 3 holdovers that might disappoint you.</p><p>Here are the key reasons you should buy a Pixel Watch 4, along with some reasons why you shouldn't!</p><h2 id="why-you-should-buy-the-google-pixel-watch-4-2">Why you SHOULD buy the Google Pixel Watch 4</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3609px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="v4GQmv4HRz7szaDdJxT6ma" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-4-on-charger-1" alt="Pixel Watch 4 on the sharger" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v4GQmv4HRz7szaDdJxT6ma.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3609" height="2030" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Take inventory of how often you charge your current Pixel Watch. The Pixel Watch 4 has a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/google-pixel-watch-4-qi-wireless-charging" target="_blank">new side-mounted charger</a> that hits 50% power in 15 minutes or a full charge 15–20 minutes faster. <strong>Speedier charging</strong> helps to counteract draining GPS workouts or quickly top up before or after sleep tracking.</p><p>The Watch 4 also delivers a <strong>significant battery boost</strong>. The Watch 4 41mm and 45mm hit 30 and 40 hours with AOD, respectively, so compare that against your current watch's lifespan. Every bit of capacity matters, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a> will give your older Pixel Watch an efficiency boost, too, if you're patient.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3838px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eHqY4dYAGg8YXsJPqyMsLc" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-4-AI-Smart-Replies-2" alt="AI Smart Replies on the Pixel Watch 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eHqY4dYAGg8YXsJPqyMsLc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3838" height="2159" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Most recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a> have Gemini, but only the Pixel Watch 4 adds <strong>on-device AI smart replies</strong>. In our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/google-pixel-watch-4-hands-on">Pixel Watch 4 hands-on</a>, we were decently impressed with the contextual usefulness of Gemini's suggested responses to messages. But if you're happy to keep using voice-to-text or pull out your phone, you can skip it.</p><p><strong>Raise to Talk</strong> is arguably more exciting. Replacing "Hey Google" and the button shortcut, it lets you raise the watch to your mouth and start talking. Simple! It cuts out just a couple of seconds of waiting, but that'll add up if you're a frequent Gemini/Assistant user. Plus, the Watch 4's enhanced speakers make Gemini easier to hear.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3995px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oZEX5QtAP29h5NY8CGDFvb" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-4-and-Pixel-Watch-3-3" alt="Pixel Watch 4 (left) next to the Pixel Watch 3 (right)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oZEX5QtAP29h5NY8CGDFvb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3995" height="2247" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Watch 4's <strong>upgraded display</strong> gives you a 10% larger touchscreen, 16% smaller bezels, and 1,000 extra nits of brightness compared to the Watch 3. These are nice-to-have changes rather than essential ones, but Watch 2 or 1 owners get significant extra space for apps and notifications, plus 2,000 nits of brightness to make it properly readable outdoors.</p><p>Plus, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/the-pixel-watch-4-secret-weapon">display and battery are more <strong>easily replaceable</strong></a>, giving the Pixel Watch 4 a level of repairability not seen on previous models.</p><p>For sleep tracking, you'll appreciate the <strong>new skin temp sensor and revamped sleep algorithm</strong>.

One reason not to buy the Pixel Watch 4 is if you <strong>find a smartwatch that lasts longer</strong>. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-review">OnePlus Watch 3</a> gives you an extra 2–3 days for the same price, if you accept trade-offs like slower updates and a heavier design. Or skip Wear OS entirely for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watch</a> that lasts a week or more.</p><p>We can't judge the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-adding-ai-powered-health-coach-fitbit-and-pixel-watch">Fitbit AI coach</a> until its October launch, but as intriguing as it sounds, you shouldn't get invested if you're <strong>unwilling to pay for a subscription</strong>. Once the six-month free trial runs out, not everyone will want to pay $10/month for AI data.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3577px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RxhtQjmhZM529iZkdBnrWb" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-4-band-connector" alt="Pixel Watch 4 band connector" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RxhtQjmhZM529iZkdBnrWb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3577" height="2012" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Like its predecessors, the Pixel Watch 4's <strong>bezelless design is still vulnerable</strong> compared to the MIL-STD-810H-rated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8</a>, and Gorilla Glass 5 isn't as reliable as sapphire glass against scratches. You can buy a protective case, but this detracts from the Watch 4's edgeless look.</p><p>Lastly, a Pixel Watch 5 leak suggests it may get a more powerful <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/the-future-of-googles-pixel-watches-is-looking-mighty-powerful">Tensor processor</a>, while Qualcomm may still develop a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/upcoming-pixel-watches-could-play-it-safe-and-i-dont-like-it">RISC-V processor</a> with enhanced efficiency. Either way, this year's Gen-2 Snapdragon chip might be worth skipping if you wait patiently for <strong>better performance next year</strong>.</p><h2 id="making-a-final-decision-2">Making a final decision</h2><p>I'm sure the Pixel Watch 4 will be one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android watches</a> of 2025, though only a review will properly test its new features, and you'll need a good trade-in deal to make the 45mm or LTE versions affordable.</p><p>Assuming you're a current Pixel Watch owner, you need only compare the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/google-pixel-watch-4-vs-pixel-watch-2">Pixel Watch 4 vs. Watch 2</a> to see how massive the differences are; I'd certainly upgrade. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/google-pixel-watch-4-vs-pixel-watch-3">Watch 4 vs.  Watch 3 gap</a> isn't nearly as large, but you'll get twice the trade-in value for it, making it a tempting swap.</p><p>As for other brands like Samsung, core experiences like Gemini, Fitbit, and Wear OS apps will work with any Android phone. Galaxy phone owners turned off by the squircle <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-review">Galaxy Watch 8</a> could certainly switch camps, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/google-pixel-watch-4-vs-samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Watch 8 vs. Watch 4</a> battle is very competitive.</p><p>Ultimately, if you're not enthusiastic about the Pixel Watch 4's upsides, you should hold off. But if you have an older Pixel Watch or use another Android watch brand, and it looks tempting, I say go for it.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The Google Pixel 10 series has finally launched, and they're the most AI-forward phones we've seen.</p><p>The trip of phones (not counting the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-hands-on">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a>) can be seen as refined versions of the Pixel 9 series, but in the best way possible. Sure, some specs have gone unchanged, and one or two have even been downgraded, but there is a swathe of improvements that make the Pixel 10 series an enticing offering.</p><p>So, should you buy a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-hands-on">Google Pixel 10</a>? Right now, there are plenty of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/best-google-pixel-10-deals">Pixel 10 preorder offers</a> that won't last very long, especially once the phones hit store shelves on August 28. Here are some reasons why you should and shouldn't buy the Pixel 10, and who should or shouldn't consider one.</p><h2 id="why-you-should-buy-a-pixel-10-2">Why you should buy a Pixel 10</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5712px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="dtscVtTKfr8HHQWraEzqDS" name="Google-Pixel-10-all-hues" alt="Google Pixel 10 all colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dtscVtTKfr8HHQWraEzqDS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5712" height="3213" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There was a lot to like about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a> series, but the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a> takes things up a notch. Design-wise, it's nearly identical, albeit with some slight differences in size and thickness. Yes, in a time when companies are trying to push the boundaries of thinness, the Pixel 10 and 10 Pro are slightly thicker, but for good reason.</p><p>Each model comes with larger batteries, but Google is also the first Android OEM to launch a flagship smartphone with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-qi2-magnetic-charging">built-in Qi2 magnets</a>. Previously, the only Android phone with this feature was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/hmd-skyline-qi2-launch">HMD Skyline</a> from 2024, so we're pleased that it's finally coming around to more mainstream phones with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/google-pixelsnap-hands-on">Pixelsnap</a>.</p><p>Qi2 may not seem like a huge deal, but it is. It adds a ton of convenience to wireless charging, ensuring that the alignment is always correct. Plus, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phone-users">other MagSafe accessories</a> like PopSockets, phone stands, and wallets make the phones more versatile without the need for a case, like on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-support-qi2-wireless-charging">Galaxy S25 series</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="TnpFPnouK6wRZUu93pnRCQ" name="google-pixel-10-wireless-qi2-charging-dock-03" alt="The official Google Pixelsnap Qi2 wireless charger and dock for the Google Pixel 10 series" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TnpFPnouK6wRZUu93pnRCQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Then there's the new Tensor G5, which is made by TSMC. It's a switch from the previous Samsung-made chips, and it's said to bring some impressive performance and efficiency gains. Beyond that, the Tensor G5 enables <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-pixel-10-magic-cue-with-in-context-suggestions-ai-details">tons of new AI capabilities</a> for the Pixel 10 series, turning these phones into truly AI-first smartphones.</p><p>For instance, Magic Cue is a feature that presents helpful and contextual information when you most need it, saving you from having to dig for it. Voice Translation for calls is also a handy feature that helps break down language barriers by translating your voice in real-time into one of several languages. The best part is that these features are processed on-device.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vMuFmqwtuMuEQAoeLDefLS" name="google-pixel-10-pro-magic-cue-03" alt="Selecting actions with Magic Cue on a Google Pixel 10 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vMuFmqwtuMuEQAoeLDefLS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The new Tensor chip also brings welcome camera improvements and capabilities. I wasn't too impressed with the base Pixel 9 images, so I'm excited to test this out for myself on the base Pixel 10, but features like Auto Best Take and Camera Coach help make it easier than ever to capture better images, even if you're not exactly the best photographer.</p><p>And did I mention the base Pixel 10 now has a triple camera system with a 5x telephoto lens? For the same price as last year's model, the Pixel 10 is now nearly on par with its Pro siblings.</p><h2 id="why-you-shouldn-t-buy-a-pixel-10-2">Why you shouldn't buy a Pixel 10</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="AuuE4kSUwazjBbzEwnVESJ" name="google-pixel-10-pro-XL-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-03" alt="Comparing the designs of the Google Pixel 10 Pro and the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AuuE4kSUwazjBbzEwnVESJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Pixel 10 series sounds impressive on paper, but no phone is perfect. We've only had a short hands-on, but with the Pixel 10 series, we already have some reservations based on our limited experience.</p><p>Firstly, Tensor G5 may be an upgrade from its predecessor, but it likely still pales in comparison to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> found in competing phones.

The Pixel 10 (minus the Fold) follows Apple's example by removing the physical SIM card slot, meaning swapping phones will be more secure, but it won't be as easy. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/iphone-android-esim-transfer">We've struggled with eSIM</a> in the past, and even though the technology isn't new, it feels like the systems in place just aren't fully equipped to make the process seamless, especially because <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ask-jerry-the-controversial-rise-of-esims-and-why-many-users-have-concerns">it shifts the control to the carriers and OEMs</a>.</p><p>Fortunately, it's only U.S. models that are eSIM-only, but if you don't wanna deal with the potential headache it could bring, then the Pixel 10 might not be for you.</p><h2 id="who-should-and-shouldn-t-buy-the-pixel-10-2">Who should and shouldn't buy the Pixel 10</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uLPAn9TScXoYCDd3PbHAhN" name="Pixel-10-series-boquet" alt="Pixel 10 series shot" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uLPAn9TScXoYCDd3PbHAhN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Given the similarities between the Pixel 10 and its predecessor, I wouldn't really recommend these phones for anyone with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-9-one-year-later">Pixel 9</a>. If you <em>really</em> care about Qi2 or some of the new AI features enabled by Tensor G5, then perhaps there's reason to upgrade or to buy a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-vs-pixel-9">Pixel 10 over a Pixel 9</a>.</p><p>However, if you own an older Pixel phone, the Pixel 10 is a more worthwhile upgrade. Otherwise, you can forgo some of the newer AI features and buy an older model to save some money. After all, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-vs-pixel-8">Pixel 8</a> still has another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-explains-pixel-8-update-promise">five years of software updates to go</a>.</p><p>Things get a little more muddy when you're comparing the Pixel 10 series to other phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/which-samsung-galaxy-s25-model-should-you-buy">Galaxy S25 series</a>, which are known to prioritize power and performance. If that's what you're looking for, then a Snapdragon-powered phone may be more your speed.</p><p>The Pixel 10 series is positioned as AI-first phones that want to make everything easy and accessible. If that appeals to you, then the Pixel 10 is for you. The next step is to decide <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/which-google-pixel-10-model-should-you-buy">which Pixel 10 model you should buy</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The company, like all others, makes a new model every year. Unfortunately, you'll have to wait until October to actually have one on your wrist, but there's some really good news to chew on in the meantime:</p><p><strong>It's designed to be user serviceable.</strong></p><p>For a lot of people, this is the best new feature of the Pixel Watch 4. I'm one of them. For others, it doesn't matter as much. Either way, it's important for everyone. Easy for you to fix means it's also easy for someone else to fix.</p><p>We are seeing the same thing from companies making phones, though the progress is slow. If you want a phone you can fix on your dining room table without needing to be some sort of super space-age phone mechanic, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-sustainable-repairable-phones">you can find them</a>. Seeing this on a watch (and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-buds-2a-announced">Pixel Buds 2a</a> case battery is serviceable, too!) wasn't anything I expected to hear about, <em>especially</em> from Google.</p><p>It's simple, really. There are Torx screws on the back of the Pixel Watch 4, and removing them gives you access to both the battery and the display. There is no mountain of glue holding things in place, and once you've bought the parts (which Google will sell and you'll probably be able to order from a place like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ifixit.com/" target="_blank">iFixit</a>), you can swap them. No fuss, no heat guns, no complicated extra steps or lasers needed.</p><p>The case for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/pixel-buds-2a-colors-might-not-look-anything-like-the-ones-weve-seen-before">Pixel Buds 2a</a> is mostly the same. Remove a couple of screws, and you can swap the old, tired battery for a fresh one that will last you a couple more years. It's a good look and makes the products much more desirable, knowing they'll last as long as you want them to last.</p><h2 id="why-repairability-matters-2">Why repairability matters</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xHWrPWWhbVeJdUTnyDDamE" name="framework-laptop-chromebook-edition-review-included-screwdriver.jpg" alt="Framework Laptop Chromebook Edition screwdriver on top of lid" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xHWrPWWhbVeJdUTnyDDamE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Maybe you're <em><strong>not</strong></em> the kind of person who feels confident enough to tear open the back of your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">$350 smartwatch</a>. I get that. I will say you should try because when a product is designed to be serviced by the consumer, it's actually pretty easy.</p><p>That's not an accident. You can add your own windshield washer fluid to your car because it was designed to make it easy for you to do so. You might be able to change your air filter or oil if you're handy, as they are also serviceable by the end user. You're not going to change the timing belt on a 2010 Subaru unless you know what you're doing (and you hate yourself).</p><p>Electronics are the same way. Some things are simple to service by design. You can add and remove <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-screen-protectors">a screen protector</a> or a protective case. Other things need some experience and know-how, like swapping most phones' batteries. Then there are projects you need to let the professionals handle.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1779px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="cR9AGL7cWsVGt8T7PiJ7M" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-4-servicability" alt="Repairing the Google Pixel Watch 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cR9AGL7cWsVGt8T7PiJ7M.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1779" height="1001" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's not feasible to make the whole thing easy for you to tear apart in your living room.

If you're never going to fix your smartwatch yourself, you might think that doesn't matter. It does.</p><h2 id="save-some-money-too-2">Save some money, too</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3577px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RxhtQjmhZM529iZkdBnrWb" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-4-band-connector" alt="Pixel Watch 4 band connector" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RxhtQjmhZM529iZkdBnrWb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3577" height="2012" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In a perfect world, I would live in Fiji and fix electronics for a living, getting rich doing what I love. If you brought me a smartwatch because the battery won't hold a charge, I would be able to fix it.</p><p>Chances are, it wouldn't be easy, and I would charge you for the extra time it takes to get inside and the time it takes to track down those pesky parts, in addition to the cost of the new battery. Your $350 smartwatch ended up costing $200 to fix.</p><p>If you brought me a Pixel Watch 4 and I could get the part shipped to me, then spend 20 minutes with a screwdriver when they arrived, I'm going to charge you for the parts and an hour's labor.</p><p>When you don't have to lay out almost the same amount of money for a repair as it takes to buy a new product, you might do it more often. Fewer smartwatches end up in landfills as e-waste, less lithium and cobalt need to be mined, and you get to save money. The only losers are the seagulls and crows who love those huge, smelly landfills.</p><p>Google doing this with a flagship product like the Pixel Watch 4 is a really big deal. This may not be the first wearable that tech-inclined people could work on, but it's the first one designed to be easy for everybody. Selling the parts and making it easy is a big step, and it makes the Pixel Watch 4 one of the best wearables you can buy before anyone even gets a chance to use one.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="34c7453b-18cd-4353-834e-4d0e210a0344">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dH2wc4MeYB6S44EAF9CGnG.jpg' alt="Google Pixel Watch 4"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel Watch 4</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Fix it yourself</strong></em></p><p>The Pixel Watch 4 is the latest smartwatch from Google, and it's the first Pixel Watch that users can repair themselves, thanks to some thoughtful design changes.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

For one thing, you certainly can't use glass inside, restricting you to only flexible plastic films. However, most foldable phone brands advise against swapping out the factory-installed internal screen guard yourself unless it's absolutely necessary.</p><p>The choice is yours, but it doesn't hurt to buy a multi-pack and have spares lying around when you need them. This is more useful, rather than waiting around for an accident to happen and then taking action. This is why the Milomdoi 9 in 1 Screen Protector is the optimal choice for any Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold owner. It includes it all — two installation frames to make the alignment and installation effortless and smooth, three sets of tempered glass screen protectors for the outer screen, three sets of darkened glass camera lens protectors, three self-repairing TPU films for the insides of the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, and a cleaning kit. Milomdoi includes a handy QR code on the instruction manual that leads you to a step-by-step instruction video for installation, which is a neat little touch.</p><p>If you want to stick with just an external screen protector for your Google foldable, then there are plenty of choices as well. Depending on the price range you're gunning for, you can score something ultra-durable from ZAGG for $60 or settle for an upper-mid-ranger like Spigen's crack-proof GlasTR EZ FIT two-pack. And if you're planning on using a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/best-google-pixel-10-pro-fold-cases">phone case with your Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a>, you can always opt for the premium Dbrand Pixel 10 Pro Fold Prism 2.0 (Case Friendly) 2-Pack Screen Protector for $35.</p> ]]></dc:content>
