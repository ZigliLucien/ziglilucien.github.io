Google did not mention the Pixel 10 Pro Fold in its support post, so it seems the 2025 foldable is excluded for now. Nevertheless, users with a Pixel 6 through the Pixel 9 will see version BP3A.250905.014, while the Pixel 10 grabs BD3A.250721.001.B7.

Google says it's patching an issue where the screen would turn black during transitions from a webpage in an in-app browser. A camera fix for the Pixel 8 and Pixel 9 series sees the company rolling in "general" stability enhancements.</p><p>Biometrics, the ability for Pixel 6 through Pixel 9 series devices to read your fingerprint better "under certain conditions," is also rolling in.

The publication claims the device will offer three major features: wireless charging, reverse wireless charging, and NFC capabilities for "practicality" reasons. While these are elements to a handheld device that we typically expect from flagships nowadays, the post says Samsung is also focusing on the trifold's longevity.</p><p>Foldables, whether they're like the clamshell Flip 7, the book-style Fold 7, or these larger three-screen "trifolds," the publication says Samsung is supposedly looking to address durability concerns. To do this, the post claims the device is taking an "inward-folding" approach, which will enable Samsung's design to protect its "main display when folded."</p><p>This also takes us back to another alleged feature: the trifold's G-folding method. The post suspects that this mechanism will aid the device in keeping dust and other debris away from this sensitive folding display when folded shut. Additionally, there are rumors that Samsung has taken some of its work with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-finally-pulls-ahead-of-the-flip-in-sales-in-korea">Flip 7 and Fold 7's</a> hinge to increase the longevity of the trifold's folding lifespan.</p><h2 id="the-long-awaited-trifold-2">The long-awaited trifold</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="4txujVEQvBDeorsM3bCXXE" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-flip-7-mint-hands-on-4" alt="Samsung Galaxy Fold 7 and Flip 7 in Mint hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4txujVEQvBDeorsM3bCXXE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1407" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are some important notes to make here from these rumors, especially about the trifold's potential inspiration for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-says-galaxy-z-fold-7-screen-decade-long-durability-report">increased hinge/folding longevity</a>. Shortly after the latest Galaxy foldables launched, Samsung discussed its Fold 7 and how its upgraded screen and other mechanics could help it withstand up to a decade's worth of folds. The company stated its latest screen tests show that it can survive up to 500,000 folds, which would take the "average user" up to 10 years to reach.</p><p>The phone's UTG (ultra thin glass) also got an upgrade, which should help reduce the appearance of a crease even more.</p><p>On a related note, there were some rumors just recently that seemingly came <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-trifold-leak-one-ui-animations-qi2-nfc-into-focus">straight from Samsung's One UI software</a>. The leaked animations seemed to suggest NFC, wireless, and reverse wireless charging. What surfaced showed that the majority of this will be done via the right-most side of the phone, where its vertical triple camera array resides.</p><p>Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-galaxy-z-trifold-and-android-xr-headset-are-finally-landing-this-year">has confirmed</a> that its trifold is looking at a second half of 2025 launch. It's still up in the air when that could take place. Presently, we're awaiting its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/virtual-unpacked-for-samsung-next-galaxy-devices-september-date">Virtual Galaxy event</a> on September 4.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Wired headphones that connect with a traditional 3.5mm audio jack will need a USB-C to 3.5mm adapter in order to work, though.</p></article></section><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-does-music-sound-through-wired-usb-c-headphones-on-the-s25"><span>How does music sound through wired USB-C headphones on the S25?</span></h2><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Galaxy S25 gaming audio</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/how-does-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-handle-audio-during-gaming"><strong>How does the Samsung Galaxy S25 handle audio during gaming?</strong></a></p></div></div><p>Anyone extra persnickety about sound quality knows that wired audio is always superior because the signal doesn't have to be compressed to go through a cable, the way it has when using wireless Bluetooth speakers or headphones. Even using high-tech codecs like LDAC doesn't deliver <em>true</em> hi-res audio because there's always a level of compression between your phone and Bluetooth earbuds.</p><p>Audiophiles worried about downgrading their audio quality by switching to a Galaxy S25 have nothing to fear. Samsung's engineers have ensured that you get excellent quality audio from the Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25 Plus, and Galaxy S25 Ultra, regardless of how you're listening to music.</p><p>While the Galaxy S25 family doesn't have a traditional 3.5mm headphone jack, you can always pick up an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Headphone-Adapter-JSAUX-Compatible-Samsung/dp/B07XYQ2ZKH/">inexpensive USB-C to 3.5mm adapter</a> to connect wired headphones to a Galaxy S25. Thankfully, there's nothing to configure or pair when you use a pair of wired headphones. Just plug them in and enjoy the tunes!</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">best music streaming service</a>, Tidal Hi-Fi, works perfectly on the Galaxy S25 Ultra and is even better when paired with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-headphones">best USB-C headphones</a>. This ensures that you don't have to worry about remembering your adapter, and also never have to worry about charging a pair of headphones or earbuds just to use them.

Samsung prefers LDAC over aptX HD, so be sure to look for LDAC when you choose a pair of Bluetooth earbuds or headphones to get the highest possible wireless sound quality. The Galaxy S25 family supports SBC, AAC, LDAC, and Samsung Seamless Codec for Bluetooth playback.</p><p>While LDAC and aptX HD are the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-to-stream-hi-res-music-from-phone">best way to stream hi-res audio</a>, there's no such thing as true lossless audio over Bluetooth. A Bluetooth signal <em>always</em> has to be compressed to some degree, and while most people probably can't tell the difference between a good pair of wired headphones and high-quality hi-res Bluetooth earbuds, audiophiles won't be fooled.</p><p>That being said, only Sony phones deliver higher-quality audio playback, as our sister site <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.whathifi.com/smartphones-tablets/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra">What Hi-Fi pointed out</a> in their Galaxy S25 Ultra review. Our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/these-9-earbuds-support-high-res-codecs">best hi-res Bluetooth earbuds</a> guide will help you narrow down your choices, but here are a few quick picks from the top to get you started:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C345M3T7"><strong>Sony WF-1000XM5</strong></a>: The best hi-res Bluetooth earbuds on the market. They (unsurprisingly) support Sony's LDAC codec, which is perfect for the Galaxy S25 family.</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DCQ4GLL2"><strong>Bowers & Wilkins Pi8</strong></a>: We recommend these for non-Samsung Android phones, as they primarily support the aptX HD codec for hi-res audio transfer.</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Edifier-NeoBuds-Plus-Cancelling-Bluetooth/dp/B0DHRMD3JT/"><strong>Edifier NeoBuds Plus</strong></a>: A more budget-conscious choice that still supports LDAC and hi-res sound.</li></ul><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-does-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-s-sound-quality-really-compete-with-apple-or-sony"><span>Does the Samsung Galaxy S25's sound quality really compete with Apple or Sony?</span></h2><p>Sony has long been considered the de facto standard for Android phone audio quality, but Samsung is no slouch in the audio department. While Apple notably enhanced its audio quality with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16</a> release, the Galaxy S25 family isn't too far behind, offering crisp and detailed audio quality, specializing particularly in delivering clear vocals.</p><p>Audio reviews of the Galaxy S25 family have often noted that low-level dynamics aren't quite as good as Apple's or Sony's latest phones, but that the S25 family is still in the overall top tier when it comes to sound reproduction. That's particularly true when using the built-in speaker on the S25 family, as Samsung's use of Dolby Atmos tuning transforms the phone's speakers into a virtual wall of sound.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 family supports everything you need to get a high-quality audio experience on the go. Wired headphones using a USB-C cable are the best option for the highest possible quality sound, while Bluetooth earbuds that support hi-res LDAC audio are the second-best option. We recommend browsing our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/what-are-the-best-headphones-to-pair-with-the-galaxy-s25-for-premium-sound">best Galaxy S25 premium headphones</a> guide so you can get a full understanding of what's available and what makes them the best for Samsung's 2025 flagships.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-is-the-audio-quality-consistent-across-different-apps-on-the-s25"><span>Is the audio quality consistent across different apps on the S25?</span></h2><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 family's audio quality is managed on a system level to ensure consistent audio quality between apps. Samsung offers a built-in audio equalizer with support for several Dolby Atmos profiles, sound presets, adaptive age filters, and even a UHQ upscaler for supported wired headphones.</p><p>While some apps may have individual equalizers that can be used in addition to the system equalizer, it's recommended to use Samsung's built-in option for the most consistent audio quality.</p><p>Each type of audio source can have its own settings, too, and the Galaxy S25 will intelligently remember which settings you prefer for each audio source. For example, if I connect my Bluetooth <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro</a> to my Galaxy S25 Ultra, it will have individual settings I've tailored for it, while a pair of wired headphones will have a different set of settings saved and automatically applied.</p><p>Apps can individually have their own sound profiles, too. Here's how to configure that:</p><p>1. Launch your audio app of choice and <strong>start playing a song or video</strong>.</p><p>2. Pull down on the right side of the status bar and <strong>long-press the volume slider</strong>.</p><p>3. A <strong>Sound and effects</strong> box will appear with audio options for the specific app that's playing audio.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3030px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.73%;"><img id="RqGYRQGPb4w72XCqtcarKg" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-app-audio" alt="Adjusting app audio settings on the Galaxy S25" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RqGYRQGPb4w72XCqtcarKg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3030" height="3052" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This way, each app can have its own distinct audio settings.

Individual hearing profiles can be made to adjust for hearing loss for different age ranges, as well as sound tuning via a 9-slider equalizer with various presets. Each audio source also includes its own customizable preset that is automatically saved.</p><p>To access the system-level equalizer and sound profiles, follow these steps:</p><p>1.

Once you've done that, open the equalizer section and tune the sound further. Equalizer allows you to very specifically tune the audio profile, while the presets and the Dolby Atmos section are more automated.</p><p>Additionally, you might want to select <strong>Boost dialogue</strong> when listening to a podcast or other audio source where human speech is the most important thing to hear. You can also choose <strong>Loudness normalization</strong> to help keep explosions and other loud sound effects from hurting your ears while watching movies or videos.</p><p>Folks looking for age-specific audio profiles should choose <strong>Adapt sound</strong>, then select your specific age bracket from the list. Clicking the gear icon next to each age bracket allows you to also choose which ear will primarily use audio for phone calls, and if you prefer a clear or soft sound profile.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Additionally, it comes with an aux cable and a 3.5mm port, a travel pouch, and the USB-C charging cable.</p><h2 id="leftover-labor-day-deals-and-other-discounts-quick-links-2">Leftover Labor Day deals and other discounts -- quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Amazon:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals">discounted headphones, dorm appliances, and more</a></li><li><strong>Best Buy:</strong> <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals">up to $250 off Chromebooks, tablets</a></li><li><strong>Walmart:</strong> <a href="https://www.walmart.com/shop/savings/electronics">major savings on Chromebooks, smart TVs</a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/">foldable phones, trade-in opportunities</a></li><li><strong>Lenovo: </strong><a href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/d/deals/doorbusters/">epic laptop sale, free shipping for students</a></li><li><strong>Dell:</strong> <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/deals">students get 10% off all back-to-school purchases</a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

No more trying to hit play at the exact same moment — you'll both be in sync!

The post states users can still converse with the AI model even when noise is abundant around you, like if you're watching TV or there are other people around. Additionally, answering calls just got a little easier: just nod your head (or shake it!) to answer or decline.</p><p>The company's buds are also in line to pick up Adaptive Audio. Essentially, your buds will automatically adjust your volume levels depending on your surroundings to ensure you can hear your audio content, but also the world around you. This update adds "Loud Noise Protection" to help protect users' hearing.</p><p>Joining these updates is one more for smartwatches. Google states users can begin a "walking or biking" navigation on their phone via Maps and watch it appear on their smartwatch. The post touts this as "automatic, hands-free guidance" that users don't have to think about. Once things have begun on your phone, just check your watch to make sure you're on the right path.</p><p>Google states these updates are rolling out today (Sep 3); however, it may take some time before everyone sees them. The rollout is expected to last a "couple of weeks," so just keep tabs on your devices for the new goodies.</p><p>Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/first-things-to-do-with-the-google-pixel-10">Pixel 10 series</a> launched with this new Material 3 Expressive redesign. However, the company clued us into this massive Android revamp <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-unveils-the-most-massive-android-redesign-ever">during its I/O conference</a> earlier in May. While it is the biggest redesign the OS has had, its purpose is not only to make things pretty but to make everything easier to do. Google combined colors, shapes, effects, and more to bring about a more "expressive" design to Android users.</p><p>The company also explained that it focused on making buttons and elements large enough to tap and see, so people can do what's required and keep moving.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="067be8d6-bc32-44cf-992a-3c6a77e7e366">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/roHfB8CwZvHJScuZ8TL6Bf.jpg' alt="Google Pixel 10"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 10</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>If you're looking for Pixel magic, here it is.

My wife and I love the outdoors, swimming pools, and beaches. We literally live between mountains, deserts, and the California coastline, so we love a quick VRBO weekend getaway, and music plays a part in that, no matter where we might find ourselves. Often, those getaways also include our friend group, so having a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-speakers">portable speaker</a> that sounds good and can withstand the demands of wherever we might find ourselves is essential.</p><p>I have a feeling that the Bose SoundLink Plus will play an important part in those excursions going forward. It sounds great and can stand up to the beach, the boat, a small gathering, and more. Let’s get into that, along with my recounting of the day I almost drowned, but the SoundLink Plus didn’t.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Categories</p></th><th  ><p>Bose SoundLink Plus</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Bluetooth 5.4, Multipoint support</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Driver/Acoustic Architecture</p></td><td  ><p>One subwoofer, one tweeter, four passive radiators</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Codec support</p></td><td  ><p>SBC, AAC, aptX Adaptive (Snapdragon Sound)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery life</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 20 hours, 4 hours at max volume (replaceable battery)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging</p></td><td  ><p>USB-C, 5 hours to full, charge-out at 15W</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Durability</p></td><td  ><p>IP67</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>App support</p></td><td  ><p>Android, iOS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Black, Blue Dusk, Citrus Yellow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h2 id="drowning-in-sound-in-a-manner-of-speaking-2">Drowning in sound.

It wasn’t one of the highly trafficked, well-known beaches like those found in Venice, Santa Monica, or Malibu. We went to a section of the beach, a bit off the beaten path, a spot we’d been to before.</p><p>Long story short, the tide came in much higher and earlier than expected, and we had some dicey moments getting back up the beach. So much so that we lost most things in our wagon, trying to get it across that wet section, including the Bose SoundLink Plus I had just started reviewing.</p><p>Much to my surprise, about 10 feet further down the beach, on some rocks, there was the SoundLink Plus. It had washed out, and the tide brought it right back in. It passed the float test, and we didn’t die.</p><p>With the accidental durability test out of the way, I turned my attention to testing the sound quality. Let’s backtrack a little, first.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LPA8LQwTPkYqiyF6mNDNd7" name="bose-soundlink-plus-carrying-loop" alt="Bose SoundLink Plus being held by the rugged nylon carry loop" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LPA8LQwTPkYqiyF6mNDNd7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The last speaker I tested was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/beats-pill-2024-review" target="_blank">Beats Pill</a>. It’s very light, quite small, and a pretty solid device with great sound for its size. You notice the difference immediately when you pick up the Bose SoundLink Plus. It feels much heavier in hand and is visibly larger than the Pill, about the size of a Pill and a half.</p><p>It features a soft-touch body, playback and function controls on top, a powder-coated speaker grille on the front, and an open USB-C port on the rear, along with more porting. I used that port on three different devices to test out the charge-out feature and had no issues charging any of them.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="LKGD3aMotdUmxb9HEu7ZJ9" name="bose-soundlink-plus-controls.JPG" alt="Bose SoundLink Plus top panel controls" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LKGD3aMotdUmxb9HEu7ZJ9.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="LLqvK3P6hFVmjoSJ7hcAT9" name="bose-soundlink-plus-nylon-loop-usb-c.JPG" alt="Bose SoundLink Plus nylon carry loop" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LLqvK3P6hFVmjoSJ7hcAT9.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="hneVVRvfvPjCg9aVAbiCdA" name="bose-soundlink-plus-on-the-fence.JPG" alt="Bose SoundLink Plus hanging from a fence from the rugged nylon carry loop and a carabiner" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hneVVRvfvPjCg9aVAbiCdA.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="soVfpwpzXDBuzSF44TqZAA" name="bose-soundlink-plus-fence-cu.JPG" alt="Bose SoundLink Plus hanging from a fence from the rugged nylon carry loop and a carabiner" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/soVfpwpzXDBuzSF44TqZAA.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="WSb9gs8JLofB3zLtgVwVx9" name="bose-soundlink-plus-bluetooth.JPG" alt="Bose SoundLink Plus Bluetooth connecting" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WSb9gs8JLofB3zLtgVwVx9.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The controls are responsive and easy to access, with the one in the middle serving as a customizable shortcut button that can be assigned to support Bose Speaker Link or to launch Spotify features.</p><p>This may sound silly, but the premium finish of the SoundLink Plus is a delight, down to small details like the thick, color-matched nylon carry rope attached to the side that feels like it will stand up to years of abuse.

I took the SoundLink Plus to my local park for testing. It’s a large park with large, open spaces alongside playgrounds, a skate park, baseball diamonds, and soccer fields.</p><p>I tested the sound quality at distances of 10, 25, and 50 feet. As physics dictates, the further away from the speaker you get, the more nuance you’ll lose. That said, for a speaker this size, the volume is surprisingly loud at 50 feet. Even better at 25 feet, and ideal at 10 to 15 feet.</p><p>Using Sennheiser’s new BTD700 dongle, which supports aptX Snapdragon Sound, I was able to maintain a stable connection 50 feet away from the Soundlink Plus. This was line of sight with no obstructions between me and the phone. I’ll explain why I was using the dongle shortly.</p><p>The sound was weighty at 10 and 25 feet. It was warm, robust, and had a very satisfying bass response. The genres best played through the speaker will be those with upper mid and treble-forward sonics, such as Jazz, Folk, Rock, R&B, and Classical. Instrumentation and vocals are clear and crisp, but keep in mind this is a mono speaker, so instrument separation is affected. The speaker sounds so good that I’d love to hear two in the supported stereo configuration.</p><p>Hip hop, Dubstep, and the more bottom-heavy genres fare well, but the bass will lose punch further from the speaker than 20 feet — something you’ll experience with all but the largest of wireless speakers intended for outdoor use, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/soundboks-4-bluetooth-speaker-hands-on">the 36lb SOUNDBOKS 4</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5712px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QzxC4L88yAGSDkzGYmAzC9" name="bose-soundlink-plus-speakers-grille" alt="Bose SoundLink Plus pulling double duty as a "bookshelf speaker"" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QzxC4L88yAGSDkzGYmAzC9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5712" height="3213" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Indoors, the SoundLink Plus is a delight!

The SoundLink Plus isn’t large on features, but big on sound and refinement. The Tribit isn’t as portable-friendly as Bose, but some may prefer its feature set and sound. The Xtreme 3 is larger and louder, but with the size comes less portability, subjectively speaking. It’s also a generation old.

The company's chips have come a long way since then, culminating in the Tensor G5 platform that powers the Google Pixel 10 series. Tensor G5 features more custom components than ever, improving performance and optimization, all while using TSMC's industry-leading 3nm process node.</p><p>Tensor G5 doubles down on what Google silicon does best, refining performance for everyday tasks, improving stability and battery life, and adding power for on-device AI processing. In a way, it also doubles down on what Google silicon isn't — Tensor G5 is not a benchmark-killer and will always lag behind Qualcomm and Apple designs. With that being said, it's upgraded in all the right places, making the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Google Pixel 10 series</a> a joy to use.</p><p>Here's everything you need to know about the Tensor G5 mobile platform, including benchmark tests against all the best Android phones and processors.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-tensor-g5-features-specifications-and-upgrades"><span>Tensor G5: Features, specifications, and upgrades</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="BfTF9ZDCe3w4vU2zJiRxoT" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-and-10-pro-with-boxes" alt="A jade Google Pixel 10 Pro and a white Google Pixel 10 Pro XL with their respective boxes" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BfTF9ZDCe3w4vU2zJiRxoT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Tensor G5 marks the highly anticipated switch to TSMC as Google's chip manufacturing partner. The first four generations of Tensor chips were made by Samsung Foundry, which has struggled to keep up with TSMC's advanced fabrication processes. Specifically, the Tensor G5 chip is manufactured using TSMC's 3nm process node — the same one that serves as the foundation for Qualcomm's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> and Apple's A18 Pro.</p><p>Google explains that this new manufacturing technology helps it "pack more transistors into the chip so it’s more powerful and efficient." The company claims the Tensor G5's CPU is 34% faster on average than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a>. It's even better for AI tasks, as the Tensor G5 tensor processing unit (TPU) is up to 60% more powerful. There's no official word on how much better graphics performance is compared to Tensor G4, but you'll see in our tests that there are clear improvements.</p><div ><table><caption>Tensor G5 breakdown</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Tensor G5</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>CPU</p></td><td  ><p>1x Arm Cortex-X4 (3.78GHz)<br>5x Arm Cortex-A725 (3.05GHz)<br>2x Arm Cortex-A520 (2.25GHz)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>GPU</p></td><td  ><p>PowerVR DXT-48-1536</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>TPU</p></td><td  ><p>4th-generation Tensor Processing Unit</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>LPDDR5X</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Some of the new Tensor G5 components include a new image-signal processor (ISP), which is expected to result in better photos and videos.

Now, Pixel users are looking to the Tensor G5 to bring performance that's finally on par with Apple and Qualcomm chipsets. Does the Pixel 10, powered by Tensor G5, live up to the hype? The answer is mixed, because while the Tensor G5 platform makes the Pixel 10 better for daily use than ever, it still lags behind in synthetic benchmark tests.</p><p>In CPU-heavy benchmarks like Geekbench 6, we see both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-review">Pixel 10</a> and Pixel 10 Pro models produce slightly higher results than the Pixel 9 series. The Pixel 10 Pro puts up better numbers than the base Pixel 10, even though both are powered by Tensor G5. This is likely because the Pixel 10 lacks the vapor chamber used to cool the Pixel 10 Pro and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review">Pixel 10 Pro XL</a>, resulting in better performance and stability on the more expensive models.</p><p>While the Tensor G5 chip beats both the Tensor G4 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-official-exynos-2500-soc-unpacked-devices-reveal">Samsung Exynos 2500</a> processors in single-core tests, the Exynos 2500 actually pulls ahead in multi-core performance. The Tensor G5 platform falls short of even coming close to either the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-vs-regular-snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a> processors.</p><div ><table><caption>Tensor G5 bechmark comparisons</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Test</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel 10 (Tensor G5)</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel 10 Pro/XL (Tensor G5)</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel 9 Pro XL (Tensor G4)</p></th><th  ><p>Honor Magic 7 Pro (Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite)</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra (Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy)</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 (Samsung Exynos 2500)</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Geekbench 6 (single-core)</strong></p></td><td  ><p>2,179</p></td><td  ><p>2,333</p></td><td  ><p>1,895</p></td><td  ><p>2,965</p></td><td  ><p>3,001</p></td><td  ><p>1,849</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Geekbench 6 (multi-core)</strong></p></td><td  ><p>4,777</p></td><td  ><p>6,375</p></td><td  ><p>4,111</p></td><td  ><p>6,342</p></td><td  ><p>9,381</p></td><td  ><p>6,822</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Geekbench AI (quantized score)</strong></p></td><td  ><p>2,742</p></td><td  ><p>3,703</p></td><td  ><p>3,049</p></td><td  ><p>2,115</p></td><td  ><p>4,026</p></td><td  ><p>3,581</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>3DMark Wild Life Extreme (score)</strong></p></td><td  ><p>3,122</p></td><td  ><p>3,254</p></td><td  ><p>2,483</p></td><td  ><p>6,391</p></td><td  ><p>4,855</p></td><td  ><p>4,400</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>3DMark Wild Life Extreme (FPS)</strong></p></td><td  ><p>18.70</p></td><td  ><p>19.49</p></td><td  ><p>14.86</p></td><td  ><p>38.27</p></td><td  ><p>29.08</p></td><td  ><p>26.35</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Even the Tensor G5's TPU doesn't make a splash in benchmark test, with memory being the determining factor in AI performance. With just 12GB of RAM, the base-model Pixel 10 loses in the Geekbench AI benchmark to both the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy and Exynos 2500 chips. The Pixel 10 Pro fares better with 16GB RAM, beating Samsung's chip but still falling short of Qualcomm.</p><p>Notably, the Tensor G5 appears to be very underpowered for gaming, according to benchmark results. Neither the Pixel 10 nor the Pixel 10 Pro could break the 20FPS barrier in 3DMark's Wild Life Extreme test, whereas the winner (Snapdragon 8 Elite) posted a result of 38.27FPS. This continues a trend of Pixel phones, and Tensor processors, being very weak where graphical performance is concerned.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-tensor-g5-daily-use-and-performance"><span>Tensor G5: Daily use and performance</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="hAQ6J4uRNwQFrgzFoGtieS" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-gaming-genshin-impact" alt="Playing Genshin Impact on a Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hAQ6J4uRNwQFrgzFoGtieS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Of course, benchmarks only tell part of the Tensor G5 story. The more important part is arguably how the silicon fares in daily use of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/which-google-pixel-10-model-should-you-buy">Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, and Pixel 10 Pro XL</a>. There's good news and bad news in that department. While our testing of the Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL revealed gaming improvements — it ran Minecraft and Genshin Impact at 60FPS, whereas the Pixel 9 Pro would be lucky to hit 40FPS — those are still lackluster figures for games that aren't that demanding.</p><p>If mobile gaming is part of your "daily use" of a smartphone, you might want to steer clear of a Tensor G5-powered device. It just isn't going to compete with a Qualcomm or Apple-powered smartphone in terms of graphics. However, if you're not a big smartphone gamer, the Tensor G5 chip seems a lot more appealing.</p><p>It adds quality-of-life features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-pixel-10-magic-cue-with-in-context-suggestions-ai-details">Magic Cue</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/how-to-use-camera-coach">Camera Coach</a>, improves CPU and TPU performance, and upgrades camera quality with a new ISP.

I had the opportunity to chat with the company's chief design officer and co-founder, Domen Barovič, about the brand's latest innovation.</p><p>An architect by profession, Barovič is well versed in design philosophy and the human aspect of building something. We talked about Chipolo's latest trackers, the LOOP and CARD, which are the brand's first rechargeable trackers and the "best products [they've] ever made," according to Barovič.</p><p>"We've been in the Bluetooth business for more than 10 years. Along the way, we got a lot of experience, a lot of feedback, and we incorporated everything that we know our users love and adore into our new products."</p><p>Chipolo's novel trackers also feature a robust IP67 water and dustproof rating, a 400ft Bluetooth range, and the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/bluetooth-6">Bluetooth 6</a> spec. This enables two connected <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-you-need-know-about-bluetooth-le-audio">BLE</a> devices to use Channel Sounding for better location accuracy, distance measurement, and power efficiency.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://chipolo.net/en/products/chipolo-loop">Chipolo LOOP</a> is a small circular tracker that charges via USB-C. Meanwhile, the card-shaped <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://chipolo.net/en/products/chipolo-card">Chipolo CARD</a> supports Qi wireless charging and magnetic alignment. Both trackers promise a six-month battery life from a single full charge.</p><h2 id="magnetic-wireless-charging-that-isn-t-magsafe-or-qi2-2">Magnetic wireless charging that isn't MagSafe or Qi2</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1350px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="GkmKn8yLzmQbdvx5hCyS6C" name="Chipolo-CARD-Charcoal-2025-lifestyle" alt="Chipolo CARD 2025 Bluetooth tracker in Charcoal" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GkmKn8yLzmQbdvx5hCyS6C.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1350" height="759" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Chipolo)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When you think about magnetic wireless charging, your first thought is probably about MagSafe or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/qi2">Qi2</a> technology. On the contrary, Chipolo went the unconventional route, sticking with basic Qi wireless charging on the new Chipolo CARD. Yet, Chipolo somehow managed to incorporate magnets in the design as well. I was curious about this decision, especially since Qi2 is the latest industry standard and combines the two functions — wireless charging and magnetism — into one.</p><p>While it may seem like an awful lot of work, Chipolo had a very good reason to forgo Qi2 in favor of the older Qi standard, and Barovič was very straightforward with the explanation. "The honest answer here is that Qi2 involves larger coils. I can say it with quite confidence that it's impossible to make it in such a thin form factor. So what we did is, we combined the best of both worlds."</p><p>He went on to explain that Chipolo was happy with the basic Qi wireless charging speed since users only need to recharge their CARD trackers once every six months. To top it off, the CARD has a tiny 200mAh-ish battery that doesn't take long to recharge wirelessly anyway. Thus, it made more sense for the designers to adapt magnets into the old Qi spec rather than work with a bulkier Qi2 coil that would ruin the lightness and slimness of the product. At the end of the day, it was the auto-alignment ability that mattered.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="zuavES3typ4fWVrb8Uw9Mn" name="Chipolo-Domen-Barovic-CDO-cofounder-2025-lifestyle" alt="Chipolo's Chief Design Officer and Co-founder, Domen Barovič, featured speaking on stage at a launch event in mid-2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zuavES3typ4fWVrb8Uw9Mn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4500" height="2531" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Chipolo)</span></figcaption></figure><p>"We're very proud that our product aligns in the center [of the wireless charger]. There are a lot of tech companies that focus more on the tech than the user. They say it works, and that's enough. We're more of a user-oriented company. So that was very important for us."</p><p>Barovič jovially mentioned that in a way, they "introduced Qi 1.5" to the world by coming up with this workaround.</p><p>Making use of workarounds isn't something new to Chipolo. In fact, it's been dabbling in bypasses and hacks since the very beginning. "When we first introduced our Bluetooth trackers, that was 11 years ago. Bluetooth actually was not built for this purpose. We constantly had to hack something," reminisced Barovič.</p><h2 id="the-future-of-bluetooth-trackers-2">The future of Bluetooth trackers</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:907px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="VEB8hxhpyUkEg9u4u8cZYL" name="Chipolo-LOOP-and-CARD-2025" alt="Chipolo LOOP 2025 and Chipolo CARD 2025 Bluetooth trackers" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VEB8hxhpyUkEg9u4u8cZYL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="907" height="510" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Chipolo)</span></figcaption></figure><p>After drifting into the past, our conversation eventually ventured into the future of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-trackers">Bluetooth trackers</a>. I inquired about the possibility of Chipolo adapting UWB (Ultra-Wideband) into its future products. Barovič stated that the technology would have to catch up first.</p><p>"In the user testing that we did, we found out that it doesn't make that much sense. That's one point. And the second is that we've introduced Bluetooth Low Energy 6 chips. We're the first to have BLE 6 in our trackers. BLE 6 enables Channel Sounding, so it's similar to UWB, but it uses the Bluetooth protocol. The distance part is covered, but as for the directions, currently, it's not there — but we're taking steps. UWB is great to have. We're just waiting for the technology to catch up."</p><p>For now, users seeking quieter findability methods will have to rely on the LED status light in the Chipolo trackers.</p><p>Beyond new features like UWB, other potential developments to look forward to include Chipolo integrations. Barovič also delved into the possibility of different form factors and the adoption of Qi2, but only if the need arises among users.</p><p>Above all else, Chipolo is leaning heavily on integrations with other companies. Although Barovič was not able to explicitly share what collaborations are coming up, he did highlight that this is a key focal point for Chipolo. The brand aims to add findability to everyday items such as toolboxes and motorbikes created by other companies, rather than creating its own findable products from scratch. Many such Chipolo integrations already exist, and they will only increase in the days to come.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Finnish fitness brand Polar, best known for its H10 chest strap and high-end running watches, is throwing its hat in the ring with the Polar Loop band.</p><p>Measuring just 9mm thick and weighing 29g, the Polar Loop uses a soft textile band designed for more seamless sleep tracking than your typical smartwatch that weighs 2-3X more and is thick enough to get caught on your pillow.</p><p>The Polar Loop relies on automatic workout detection via the built-in accelerometer and Precision Prime HR sensor to determine when you're working out and gauge your daily training load and burned calories. But you can also start a workout in the Flow app for more specificity, especially to activate the connected GPS from your phone.</p><p>Polar has confirmed that the Loop will be subscription-free and that "every feature is ready on day one." You'll spend $199 / €179 / £149 upfront, whereas the popular Whoop 5.0 screenless band costs a minimum of $199 per year to access your data.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:7774px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="UGosNsqRzmYD5MwP9PsuBC" name="polar-loop-press-photo-1" alt="Press photo of two Polar Loop screenless wristbands (one beige, one black) on two different athletes' arms from a top-down perspective, their arms held close together in opposite directions." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UGosNsqRzmYD5MwP9PsuBC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="7774" height="4373" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Polar)</span></figcaption></figure><p>"We don't want to rent out our customers' data," said Polar account marketing specialist Michael Herlihy in an interview with Android Central about the Loop.</p><p>Polar claims that the Loop is "slim enough to share space with a traditional watch." If you want 24/7 health data but also prefer a luxury watch, you could try wearing them together, though the opposite wrist seems more natural.</p><p>I asked Herlihy why Polar chose a wristband instead of an armband like its own Verity Sense strap. He replied that the "ergonomics" of the wristband form factor feels more natural to users and that it provides much better activity tracking metrics.</p><div ><table><caption>Polar Loop specs</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Polar Loop</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Size</p></td><td  ><p>42 x 27 x 9mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>29g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Water resistance</p></td><td  ><p>WR30</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Operating temp</p></td><td  ><p>-20ºC to 50ºC (-4ºF to 122ºF)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery life</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 8 days standard use</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging</p></td><td  ><p>USB-C, rechargeable and replaceable Li-Pol battery (170mAh)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Bluetooth 5.1</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Sensors</p></td><td  ><p>Precision Prime optical HR, accelerometer</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Key data</p></td><td  ><p>Steps, distance, calories, active time, average and max HR, HRV, overnight recovery, sleep duration and stages, suggested bedtime, training load pro, fitness test, voice guidance</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The Polar Loop is splash-resistant, capable of withstanding a shower or a quick dunk in water, but it isn't designed for prolonged water sports, Herlihy warned.</p><p>It's packed with the same Polar Precision Prime HR sensor technology found in watches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/polar-vantage-v3-review">Polar Vantage V3</a>, meant to detect and counteract the effects of rapid arm movement and other factors that impact accuracy.</p><p>Because the Loop has no display, users will need to check the Polar Flow app to check things like their sleep scores, daily training load scores, and post-workout stats. Like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">smart ring</a>, it's meant to untether you from the annoyance of constant notifications while still keeping you healthy and motivated.</p><p>Polar will have a direct competitor in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit/amazfi-balance-2-helio-strap-combo-elevated-features-launch">Amazfit Helio Strap</a>, a $99 screenless, 24/7 workout band with 10 days of battery life (two more than the Polar Loop). Polar will be counting on fitness fans being familiar with its products and confident in its HR data to justify the higher cost.</p><p>Whoop bands have a wider range of health data, but cost significantly more over time, and the company is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/whoop-no-intention-dropping-its-blood-pressure-insights-fda-report">currently fighting with the FDA</a> over blood pressure data.

Its ergonomic design is also great for sleep tracking, but it can't track workouts; Garmin fans hoping for a screenless training tool may turn to the Polar Loop instead.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="4466b9b8-17b3-4efc-9430-e5159b7f3f97">            <a href="https://www.polar.com/us-en/loop" data-model-name="Polar Loop" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TBTXje9TEpsBMcH38RgawA.jpg' alt="Render of the beige Polar Loop screenless wristband sitting in white space."></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                    <span class='featured__label horizontal__label'>No distractions</span>                                                            <div class="featured__title">Polar Loop</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The Polar Loop uses a Gen 3.5 optical HR sensor — same as the Polar Pacer Pro — and an accelerometer for automatic workout detection, so you can simply start and stop exercising at will and never worry about your stats distracting you.

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>As someone who switches phones every other week, I don't bother with cases most of the time. There are only two phones where I feel the need to do so — Pixels and iPhones. With just one iPhone model coming out yearly, I feel it's prudent to put a case on that device.</p><p>I tend to use Pixels the longest over the course of a year, and while Google shored up its build quality in the last two years, I've damaged enough of its devices in the past to be wary of breaking yet another phone. In fact, I had a minor scare just a day after getting the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review">Pixel 10 Pro XL</a>; the phone took a tumble onto a tiled floor, and while I was initially worried, there wasn't any damage — thankfully.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="tR6sdmMkccA3AnPJWT7j6H" name="Bellroy Pixel 10 Leather Case" alt="Bellroy Pixel 10 Leather Case against colorful backgrounds on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tR6sdmMkccA3AnPJWT7j6H.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When I have to use a case, I prefer leather-backed choices, and that led me to Bellroy. I'm a big fan of the Bellroy's bags and accessories, and having taken the Transit Travel Pack Pro on a recent junket to London, I can attest to its efficacy at carrying a mountain of tech.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4833px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="G3uucYN7PteKHp7vjKdfqG" name="Bellroy Pixel 10 Leather Case" alt="Bellroy Pixel 10 Leather Case against colorful backgrounds on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/G3uucYN7PteKHp7vjKdfqG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4833" height="2722" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>So when I saw that the brand makes Pixel 10 leather cases, I was immediately interested. I got the Sienna color to use with my Pixel 10 Pro XL, and the Pixel 10 in Sapphire. Both colors look good, but the Sienna stands out just that little bit more. Bellroy partners with Google, so in addition to getting the case on the brand's site — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://bellroy.com/products/leather-pixel-case?color=sienna&material=leather&size=pixel10proxl">where it costs $59</a> — you can also buy it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.google.com/us/product/bellroy_leather_case_magnet_pixel_10_pro">from the Google Store</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="WAyVfRwwWoGingpUoUTswG" name="Bellroy Pixel 10 Leather Case" alt="Bellroy Pixel 10 Leather Case against colorful backgrounds on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WAyVfRwwWoGingpUoUTswG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The case itself has a clean design, and it accentuates the camera bar of the Pixel 10 Pro XL, Other than the Bellroy logo at the bottom, there's no other labeling on the case, and the build quality is excellent. The leather feels good in-hand, and the best part is that it is considerably thinner than most leather cases I used in the past, so it doesn't add too much bulk to the phone.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="jxvcoZNB5hwtLmt92iDvBH" name="Bellroy Pixel 10 Leather Case" alt="Bellroy Pixel 10 Leather Case against colorful backgrounds on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jxvcoZNB5hwtLmt92iDvBH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Coming in at 30g, the leather case doesn't weigh much either. The inside of the case has felt lining to ensure it doesn't scratch the phone, and it has aluminum buttons that have the same great tactility as the buttons on the Pixel 10 Pro XL. There's enough clearance around the bottom cutout for the USB-C charging port that I was able to use my cable with an integrated power meter without any issues.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5060px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="Hubzj8YAjPdGtyRThukSzG" name="Bellroy Pixel 10 Leather Case" alt="Bellroy Pixel 10 Leather Case against colorful backgrounds on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Hubzj8YAjPdGtyRThukSzG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5060" height="2850" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Oh, and the case has built-in magnets. One of the best features on the Pixel 10 is that it has Qi 2 integration, and while you don't need to use a magnetic case, having one makes a difference. I didn't see any problems using the case with the dozen or so Qi 2 charging pads I have in the house.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5065px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="cQJiiCVzpMv7aWZTCNfLtG" name="Bellroy Pixel 10 Leather Case" alt="Bellroy Pixel 10 Leather Case against colorful backgrounds on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cQJiiCVzpMv7aWZTCNfLtG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5065" height="2853" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The case has raised edges at the front that ensure the panel doesn't take any damage should the phone fall face-down, and you get similar protection at the back around the cameras. I've been using the case for just a few days now, and I haven't run into any issues, but I will update the post with long-term usage notes. Bellroy provides a standard three-year warranty with all of its cases against manufacturing defects, so I don't see that being a problem.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="umv2MWxr8NoBDXboE2ywwG" name="Bellroy Pixel 10 Leather Case" alt="Bellroy Pixel 10 Leather Case against colorful backgrounds on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/umv2MWxr8NoBDXboE2ywwG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Overall, I really like what Bellroy did with its Pixel 10 cases. The build quality is great, the cases don't add much bulk or heft to the phones, and they look stylish. I also like the quality of the leather, and if you're eyeing Google's latest phones and need a reliable leather case, I'd recommend going with Bellroy — this is one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/best-google-pixel-10-cases">best Pixel 10 cases</a> available.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="e0c8d35e-a42e-4200-8643-4af45734cd3e">            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FN77PCM8" data-model-name="Bellroy Pixel 10 Pro XL Leather Case" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:150%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YxRuanmox8ACueGSVfr4cJ.jpg' alt="Bellroy Pixel 10 Pro XL Leather Case"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Bellroy Pixel 10 Pro XL Leather Case</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Bellroy's Pixel 10 Pro XL leather case is one of the best available.

Instead of going for the Snapdragon 8 Elite 2 moniker, rumors say it could debut as the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5. The reason for this is due to Qualcomm reportedly developing an SD 8 Gen 5 chipset, and looking to keep its chip's names within the same realm.

According to the publication, prominent U.S. Judge Amit Mehta, who's been involved in this case for quite some time, states that Google won't have to divest its Chrome and Android assets.</p><p>Mehta adds that "Plaintiffs overreached in seeking forced divestiture of these key assets, which Google did not use to effect any illegal restraints."</p><p>However, regarding the antitrust part of this ruling, Mehta's verdict states that, moving forward, Google will have to "share search data with competitors" within the online search space. More than that, Google is also "barred...from having exclusive contracts for its Google Search, Chrome, Google Assistant, and Gemini app products."</p><p>Business Insider also highlights a statement from Mehta about how the case had evolved over the past few months.

The DOJ had some options in mind, all of which involved having Google sell off Chrome <em>and </em>Android. However, there was another choice: share more data with the competition.

All of this makes for an incredible Chromebook for everyone, even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook-students">students</a> who need something lightweight, portable, and versatile.</p><p>Pricing for the Chromebook Plus Spin 514 starts at $699, and you'll get 12 months of Google's AI Pro plan for free.

The entry-level model is powered by the 13th Gen Intel Core i3-1305U, with the high-end model being powered by the Intel Core 7 150U. Meanwhile, the Mini CXM2 comes in three configurations with the Intel N150, N250, and Core 3 N350.</p><div ><table><caption>Acer Chromebox CXI6 & Mini CXM2 Specs</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol empty" ></th><th  ><p>Acer Chromebox CXI6</p></th><th  ><p>Acer Chromebox Mini CXM2</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor(s)</p></td><td  ><p>Intel Core i3-1305U, Core 3 100U, Core 5 120U, Core 7 150U</p></td><td  ><p>Intel N150, N250, Core 3 N350</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 16GB DDR4</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 16GB LPDDR5X</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 256GB M.2 PCIe SSD</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 128GB eMMC</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Front Ports</p></td><td  ><p>3x USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A, 1x USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C, SD Card, Audio Jack</p></td><td  ><p>3x USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Ports</p></td><td  ><p>2x USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A, 1x USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C, 2x HDMI 2.1, 1x DisplayPort, 2.5G LAN</p></td><td  ><p>2x USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A, 2x USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C, 2x HDMI 2.1, LAN, Audio Jack</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, 2.5G LAN</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, Gigabit Ethernet</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>VESA Mount Compatible</p></td><td  ><p>✅ (Mount Kit Optional)</p></td><td  ><p>✅ (Mount Kit Optional)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>166.5 x 165.8 x 43.8mm</p></td><td  ><p>161.26 x 119.85 x 33.9mm</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Both of these Chromebox models max out with 16GB of RAM, and that's where most of the important similarities stop. The CXI6 supports up to 256GB of storage courtesy of an M.2 SSD, while the Mini CXM2 maxes out with 128GB of eMMC storage.</p><p>If you need more proof of that the CXI6 is slightly more versatile, look no further than the 13 ports found on the front and back. On the other hand, the CXM2 packs three USB-A ports on the front, and eight more on the back, potentially offering a "cleaner" look than the CXI6.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zKjv5d9JKSL6wWW8YtSAsN" name="acer-chromebox-cxi6-lifestyle-2" alt="Acer Chromebox CXI6 lifestyle image" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zKjv5d9JKSL6wWW8YtSAsN.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Acer)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="v6QzjCMCYe2PcZDF3bbwhC" name="acer-chromebox-mini-cxm2-lifestyle-1" alt="Acer Chromebox Mini CXM2 lifestyle image" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v6QzjCMCYe2PcZDF3bbwhC.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Acer)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Truth be told, neither of these are going to blow you away in terms of performance, but they'll make for great everyday computers.

As for the Chromebox Mini CXM2, you'll have to wait a bit longer, as it's not expected to be released until sometime in Q1 2026, and will set you back about $329.</p><ul><li><strong>Chromebook Deals: </strong><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1690538&xcust=ac_us_9829528799339934187&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1943169%2F565706%2F9383%3FsubId1%3Dac-us-1138849555607607513%26sharedId%3Dac-us%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.walmart.com%252Fbrowse%252Felectronics%252Fgoogle-chromebooks%252F3944_3951_1089430_1230091_1103213&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.androidcentral.com%2Fchromebooks-laptops%2Fsnapdragon-x-plus-chromebooks-may-soon-become-a-reality" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://shop-links.co/link?id=pcat17071&st=chromebook&publisher_slug=future&exclusive=1&u1=ac-us-1049940027559197753&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsearchpage.jsp%3Fid%3Dpcat17071%26st%3Dchromebook&article_name=Best%20back%20to%20school%20tech%20deals%202023%20%E2%80%94%20Chromebooks%2C%20smartphones%2C%20watches%2C%20and%20more&article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.androidcentral.com%2Fchromebooks-laptops%2Fbest-back-to-school-tech-deals-2023-chromebooks-smartphones-watches-and-more" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://lenovo.7eer.net/c/221109/218864/3808?subId1=ac-us-1444465790693541350&sharedId=ac-us&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fd%2Fchromebook-laptop%2F" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>Lenovo</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100048248-15852945?sid=ac-us-1271264508971809203&url=https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/mlp/laptops/chromebook-344506--1" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>HP</strong></a><strong>| </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fstores%2Fpage%2F8667F8E9-10FC-4DCC-AB6A-97566CE718A5%3Fingress%3D0%26visitId%3D46ceb076-1b26-4ec4-8324-90885a489a11%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-4420679271272975345-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>Amazon</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Google and Samsung are the major players, but brands like OnePlus are giving Wear OS another go, too. That's great news for smartwatch buyers — there's never been a better time to be in the market for a new one. Two of the best options are sure to be the Google Pixel Watch 4 and the OnePlus Watch 3.</p><p>Both Google and OnePlus were slow to offer their flagship smartwatches in multiple sizes, but now, you can get the Pixel Watch 4 and OnePlus Watch 3 in big or small packages. They each offer a different feature set, with Google doubling down on Fitbit and OnePlus prioritizing battery life. Let's break down exactly how two of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">best Wear OS smartwatches</a> compare to help you decide which one is right for you.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-watch-4-vs-oneplus-watch-3-design-and-display-2">Google Pixel Watch 4 vs. OnePlus Watch 3: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4005px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Ri39J2VrcjKLvN83mzHsbb" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-4-Fitbit-Steps-Tile-yellow" alt="Pixel Watch 4 Fitbit Steps Tile in yellow" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ri39J2VrcjKLvN83mzHsbb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4005" height="2253" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/google-pixel-watch-4-hands-on">Google Pixel Watch 4</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-review">OnePlus Watch 3</a> are distinct in terms of design. Google's smartwatch has a dainty and chic appearance, somewhat reminiscent of old analog watches. Even the larger 45mm version retains its elegance, featuring a domed glass and display that seamlessly flow into the circular aluminum chassis. By comparison, the OnePlus Watch 3 has a louder design language that also resembles analog watches, but on the other end of the spectrum.</p><p>The smaller 43mm OnePlus Watch 3 has a more subdued appearance, similar to the Pixel Watch 3, but without the domed glass. However, the original OnePlus Watch 3 is a massive 46.6mm smartwatch that looks huge on most wrists. It has a metal bezel with dial markings that protect the digital OLED display. There's also a set of two buttons on both sizes that now rotate for software navigation.</p><p>As you'll see in the comparison below, both sizes of the OnePlus Watch 3 are flashy and tough, but the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch/oneplus-watch-3-43mm-hands-on">43mm OnePlus Watch 3</a> is certainly more subtle.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vnCFbE4yji9bt6H4KH5ZUS" name="oneplus-watch-3-43mm-vs-46mm-front-wearing-02" alt="Comparing the size of the OnePlus Watch 3 46mm and 43mm on the same wrist" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vnCFbE4yji9bt6H4KH5ZUS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Comparing the size of the OnePlus Watch 3 46mm and 43mm on the same wrist. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Google Pixel Watch 4 is available in 41mm and 45mm sizes, which are smaller than the respective offerings of the OnePlus Watch 3. It sports an Actua 360 AMOLED LTPO display, and the screen is actually domed to match the cover glass this year. It supports a peak brightness rating of 3,000 nits and a  1-60Hz variable refresh rate. As such, the Pixel Watch 4 will be brighter and more visible outdoors.</p><p>The OnePlus Watch 3 also uses an LTPO AMOLED display, but this one features a 466x466 resolution and a 2,200-nit peak brightness rating. It's just as good as the Google display, albeit not as bright, which may be a concern during workouts in direct sunlight.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3248px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vwNzwni9pwToyWLQmkMZYb" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-4-sensors" alt="Pixel Watch 4 sensors on the back" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vwNzwni9pwToyWLQmkMZYb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3248" height="1827" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The OnePlus Watch 3 is decidedly more durable, packing a stainless steel chassis and sapphire-crystal glass. It also has IP68/5ATM dust and water-resistance, just like the Pixel Watch 4. The latter is no slouch with Corning Gorilla Glass 5 and an aluminum body, but it just can't compete with the OnePlus Watch 3 in this area. The domed glass style could be a liability in this area, as it may be more prone to scratches or cracks.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-watch-4-vs-oneplus-watch-3-hardware-and-specs-2">Google Pixel Watch 4 vs. OnePlus Watch 3: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3822px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ejrZiuxRvyc3BGPxe4bRDb" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-4-charger-misaligned-indicator" alt="Pixel Watch 4 on a charger indicating that the alignment is off" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ejrZiuxRvyc3BGPxe4bRDb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3822" height="2150" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Google Pixel Watch 4 brings along a chip upgrade compared to the OnePlus Watch 3, but it might not be as big a deal as you might think.

I certainly wouldn't. </p><p>In fact, while this 36% discount is active, the S25 Edge is the <em>only</em> Samsung phone that I'd consider buying today. The Galaxy S25 Edge is an absolute beast when it comes to overall design and ergonomics, and this deal makes it an absolute steal. </p> ]]></dc:content>

This isn't surprising given the complex build and the fact that the Z Fold 7 already approaches the $2,000 mark.</p><p>As for other devices, Samsung's XR headset, likely called Galaxy XR, will also be pricey, with rumors suggesting around $2,000. We don't yet know if either device will launch globally, but we hope Samsung brings them to the States.</p><p>Thankfully, we don't have to wait much longer as the next Galaxy Unpacked seems just four weeks away. Samsung hasn't officially confirmed the date yet, apart from saying the devices are coming, but we expect the brand to announce it soon.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This new module, the ISOCELL HPB, is an evolution of the HP9 engineered specifically for Vivo, which marks a step forward in camera hardware.</p><p>While 2025 is full of capable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-camera">camera phones</a>, Vivo's X300 Pro is already making a case for itself.

Where it wins? Four key things: it's more stable, faster, and delivers superior clarity and transparency.</p><h2 id="sharper-images-with-multi-frame-fusion-2">Sharper images with multi-frame fusion</h2><p>Vivo claims the X300 Pro's stabilization has achieved a CIPA 5.5 rating, which it states is the highest certification in the industry. The company is also developing custom focus-changing engines with partners to enable precise motion capture from ultra-long distances, while upgraded processing allows for high-pixel multi-frame fusion.</p><p>Co-developed with platform manufacturers, the X300 Pro’s focus-tracking engine is said to deliver faster and more reliable subject capture, even at extreme distances.</p><p>The X300 Pro's telephoto is engineered for optical-grade results, not artificial sharpening. Through exclusive Blueprint algorithms and full-stack optimization, it captures longer-range shots that are both clearer and look naturally authentic. This is backed by a ZEISS-coated, fluorite glass, APO-certified system.</p><p>At its core, the X300 Pro is tipped to run on the MediaTek Dimensity 9500. For its main camera, Vivo selected the Sony LYT-828, a 50MP sensor whose large 1/1.3-inch size and advanced architecture deliver standout HDR capabilities.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Hints of a redesign popped up earlier this year, and now, after months of waiting, users are finally seeing the updated look. First spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-quick-share-update-rolling-out-3592689/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, the refresh gives the file-sharing tool a much-needed polish.</p><p>The redesign matches <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/my-8-favorite-things-about-the-one-ui-8-beta">One UI 8</a>’s Quick Share layout, featuring a full-screen view with separate tabs for sending and receiving files, as seen in the screenshots below.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:404px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:213.86%;"><img id="xREc7tQr7WDHfYTKRuMt8H" name="Android-Quick-Share" alt="refreshed Quick Share interface on Android" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xREc7tQr7WDHfYTKRuMt8H.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="404" height="864" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:404px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:213.86%;"><img id="5avSYevQKwtkzwnPtd2u8H" name="Android-Quick-Share" alt="refreshed Quick Share interface on Android" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5avSYevQKwtkzwnPtd2u8H.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="404" height="864" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><h2 id="small-tweaks-big-convenience-gains-2">Small tweaks, big convenience gains</h2><p>In contrast, the old Quick Share was just a settings page for tweaking your device name and visibility. The new version puts your device name front and center and adds a “Sharing with you” section to show devices currently sending files your way.</p><p>The Quick Share “Send” screen now includes a built-in file picker, making it easier to choose what you’re sharing. Select multiple files, and you’ll see a preview of them upfront. The layout keeps the “Send to your devices” and “Send to nearby devices” sections, with the latter tucked at the bottom.</p><p>Google is said to be testing the update on a handful of devices, with a full rollout still on hold. This release continues last year’s effort to streamline Android’s wireless sharing by combining Nearby Share and Quick Share into a unified platform.</p><p>There’s still no exact date for a full Quick Share rollout, but with devices already receiving the update, it’s likely just around the corner.</p><p>Quick Share has expanded well beyond <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phones</a>, with Apple ecosystem support in testing. For users managing multiple devices, it’s become a go-to tool for being secure, fast, and deeply integrated into Android. This redesign isn’t groundbreaking, but it does make wireless sharing smoother.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Interestingly, most of the images show paint chipping concentrated around the power button area and the USB-C port.</p><h2 id="z-fold-7-is-showing-the-same-paint-issues-as-last-year-s-z-fold-6-2">Z Fold 7 is showing the same paint issues as last year's Z Fold 6</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rDRChdDR5xnCE77pkXyHUb" name="z-fold-7-paint-chipping-off" alt="Paint chipping off Galaxy Z Fold 7 devices" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rDRChdDR5xnCE77pkXyHUb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Reddit)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This isn't the first time Samsung's book-style foldable has faced such problems. A similar issue appeared on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-says-galaxy-z-fold-6-paint-is-peeling-due-to-unofficial-chargers">some Galaxy Z Fold 6 models</a> last year, to which Samsung replied that poorly grounded high-speed third-party chargers can "deteriorate the anodization" (the phone's protective metal finish).</p><p>The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/ca/support/mobile-devices/third-party-products-causing-paint-to-peel-off-galaxy-devices/">said</a> non-official chargers can sometimes cause current leakage, corroding the surface and leading to "delamination of the paint" and eventual paint peeling off the device.</p><div><blockquote><p>Using a high-speed third-party charger that isn’t properly grounded can lead to leakage currents that deteriorate the anodization (a protective and aesthetic finish on metal surfaces) of your Galaxy device. This may result in the delamination of the paint. To ensure the longevity and appearance of your device, we strongly recommend using only official Samsung chargers, which are specifically designed to prevent such issues.</p></blockquote></div><p>However, what's puzzling is that one Galaxy Z Fold 7 user on Reddit claims to be using Samsung's official 25W charger, so the issue could be different this time. Some users even suggest Samsung hasn't "treated the aluminum properly" this time, and the "anodized layer didn't form properly," causing the paint to flake.</p><p>For now, the issue seems limited to only a small number of devices, but it's still concerning to see a $2,000 flagship experiencing paint chipping just a month after launch. Samsung hasn't officially acknowledged the issue yet, but we'll update you as soon as we hear from the brand.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Theoretically, the turritopsis is immortal because it can regenerate endlessly, allowing it to adapt to death literally. It’s a fascinating species, go Google it (after you finish reading this).</p><p>Embodying millions of years of evolution, Hidizs chose the jellyfish as a symbol of the sonic evolution of this inexpensive, entry-level audiophile-grade pair of IEMs. They are highly adaptable, an evolution of design with their M-shaped dome Magnesium diaphragm, and aesthetically intriguing. When you first open the meticulously packaged box, you’re greeted by the two IEM units that <em>feel</em> heavy in hand, but are supremely comfortable in-ear.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="EgutyBZHeNjKk7QKmC4zri" name="" alt="Hidizs MK12 Turris various ear tips" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EgutyBZHeNjKk7QKmC4zri.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>After you remove the units and the top layer of packaging, the next layer contains the nine pairs of ear tips. Three sets, each with distinctive sonic properties. One set emphasizes vocal ranges, the next for a balanced sound, and one set for a bass-forward experience.</p><p>The “adaptability” doesn’t end there. You also get two pairs of tuning filters in the box. The default pair already installed on the MK12s is Rose Gold for balanced listening. They represent what Hidizs calls their “signature style.” Then there’s the Silent Silver, which enhances smoothness in the high frequencies, and their Enchanting Red filter, which enhances low-frequency sounds.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="T5WBzc8XBUfD8bfqUqPHRh" name="" alt="Hidizs MK12 Turris red tuning filter" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/T5WBzc8XBUfD8bfqUqPHRh.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zjJnJAteJf43ACUFzsrzfL" name="hidisz-mk12-tuning-filters" alt="Hidizs MK12 Turris additional tuning filters" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zjJnJAteJf43ACUFzsrzfL.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>I found myself enjoying the Enchanting Red filters most, but was torn between the vocal and the bass-enhancing ear tips.

Versatile. Built like a tank. The Questyle M18i is almost flawless</strong></a></p></div></div><p>All of the gear you get for under $200 is great, but how the MK12 sounds is the most important “feature.” The best aspect of a pair of IEMs’ sound signature is its ability to “feel” like the music is “in your head.” The Hidizs MK12 Turris does a fantastic job of placing you in the middle of the action. The listening experience is delightfully immersive for a pair of IEMs in this price range, and I’ve listened to some that cost more than twice as much and didn’t do as good a job.</p><p>One of the first songs I listened to was Charles Mingus’ “Moanin’” and the MK12 did not disappoint. Upper mids gave me details I hadn’t noticed in this highly frenetic Jazz composition. Some off-mic vocal riffs, some fingering of a saxophone’s keys, and other ambient sonic details that help feel like you’re sitting in the studio while the band is recording.</p><p>I can definitely say that upper mids are prominent with these IEMs. That bump in the upper mids also gave greater gravitas to the guitars in System of a Down’s “Toxicity.” It’s already one of my favorite metal hype songs, and if it’s headbanging that you’re after, you’ll want to put your skull through drywall with the Turris in your ears.</p><p>But what about the lows? Tight. Controlled. Deep and dark, thanks to the filter and ear tip combination I’ve chosen. Acoustic and orchestral tracks have weight to their basslines and instrumentation that has texture and impact. Tracks mastered with deep bass like The Roots’ “Do You Want More?!?!!” and Skrillex’s “Supersonic” have delightful resonance with the added benefit of comfortable enjoyment!</p><p>The shells of the Turris IEMs have pressure release ports, and I could feel the difference as the bass cannons in the song “Mumbai Power” slammed my eardrums. With most other headphones, the pressure from the booming sub-bass hits slam against your eardrums, but those ports made a world of difference, allowing me to spend extended periods with high-quality masters of sub-bass-heavy music.</p><p>When it comes to DAPs, I like a bit of sparkle in the top end, but the MK12 Turris’ treble is a bit too smooth, to the point of feeling constrained. I don’t know if that has anything to do with the rigidity of the Magnesium diaphragm, but it was something I noticed that became apparent as I went through my classical music test selections.</p><h2 id="x-gon-give-it-to-ya-2">X gon’ give it to ya!</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="aypri3BNX8eZRHvS44dhUZ" name="hidisz-ap80-pro-x-interface-home.JPG" alt="Hidizs AP80 PRO-X DAP home screen number one" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aypri3BNX8eZRHvS44dhUZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Hidizs AP80 PRO-X</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>Samsung 2.45" (480x360) IPS HD touchscreen</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Supported Audio Formats</p></td><td  ><p>WAV, FLAC, WMA, MP3, OGG, APE, AAC, ALAC, AIFF, Formats DFF, DSF, MQA</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Sampling Rate</p></td><td  ><p>PCM : 8kHz ~ 384kHz (8/16/24/32bits per Sample)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Decoding</p></td><td  ><p>DSD Native: DSD64, DSD128, DSD256</p><p>PCM 384kHz/32Bit</p><p>MQA decoding</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>DAC</p></td><td  ><p>ESS ES9219C x2 (Dual DAC)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Input</p></td><td  ><p>USB-C, support two-way USB DAC</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Outputs</p></td><td  ><p>Unbalance Out (3.5mm), Balance Out (2.5mm)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>EQ</p></td><td  ><p>Xbands, 8 EQ presets, Save custom EQ support, MSEB w/10 tuning functions</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Bluetooth</p></td><td  ><p>Bidirectional Bluetooth 4.2, CSR APT-X and Sony LDAC</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>Built-in, none;  512GB external via microSD</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>800mAh 3.7V Li-polymer battery</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Supported OS</p></td><td  ><p>Windows 10, 11 (32bit/64bit) / MacOS X 10.7 / iPad OS, iOS    </p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Some music lovers are looking to simplify life with distraction-free listening and are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/audio/best-mp3-players" target="_blank">rediscovering “MP3 Players' now called DAPs</a>, which often handle all types of wired and wireless audio formats.</p><p>Regarding <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/review-astell-and-kern-activo-p1" target="_blank">the best DAPs</a>, the Hidizs AP80 PRO-X is an entry-level DAP priced at $180, available in black, blue, and gray options.

It looks like that is taking shape as Samsung has started rolling out the One UI 8 beta for Galaxy S23 and A-series smartphones.</p><p>As spotted by popular Samsung tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/tarunvats33/status/1962414394744451380">Tarun Vats on X/Twitter</a>, Samsung has begun rolling out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/my-8-favorite-things-about-the-one-ui-8-beta">One UI 8</a> beta for the Galaxy S23 series in India and South Korea. The update is hefty at around 3GB+ and comes with the latest September 2025 security patch.</p><p>According to one <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS23Ultra/comments/1n5i0ut/comment/nbsytxg/">Reddit user</a>, the update seems to be available in the UK as well, but there's no news for regions like Germany and the U.S. However, considering it has started in a few countries, it should be available elsewhere soon.</p><p>If you want to try the One UI 8 beta on your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-vs-galaxy-s23">Galaxy S23</a>, you can do so by signing up using the Samsung Members app first and then downloading it via <strong>Settings > Software Update > Download and Install</strong>. The firmware version for the One UI 8 beta based on Android 16 for the Galaxy S23 series is "YHB.".</p><h2 id="one-ui-8-beta-is-live-on-galaxy-s23-a55-a54-and-more-2">One UI 8 beta is live on Galaxy S23, A55, A54, and more</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HhusjRhZmuV2a4LmQCugXX" name="one-ui-8-beta-s23" alt="One UI 8 beta update on Galaxy S23" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HhusjRhZmuV2a4LmQCugXX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tarun Vats / X)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung announced last month that it would expand One UI 8 testing to older smartphones, and the Galaxy S23 beta follows that. The Galaxy S23 joins devices like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-one-year-later">Galaxy S24</a>, Galaxy S25, Galaxy Z Flip 6, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, which have already been testing One UI 8.</p><p>In addition to the Galaxy S23 series, Samsung has started testing One UI 8 beta for some mid-range devices, including Galaxy A55, Galaxy A54, Galaxy A36, and Galaxy A35. This is notable since Samsung hasn't started testing One UI 8 for the Galaxy Z Fold 5 and Z Flip 5, but has expanded the program to mid-range devices first. We still expect <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-is-finally-selling-the-z-fold-5-certified-re-newed-on-its-website-but-is-it-worth-it">Z Fold 5</a> and Z Flip 5 support sooner or later.</p><p>One UI 8 is Samsung's flavor of Android 16, and while the company lagged in rolling out One UI 7 (Android 15), it is testing the new version comparatively faster for its flagships. One UI 8 is set to bring features like a 90:10 split-screen ratio, more supported apps for Now Bar, and revamped first-party apps like Reminders and Samsung Internet.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/1943169/614286/10014?subId1=ac-us-5420766087977553015&sharedId=ac-us&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Ftop-deals%2Fcell-phone-deals%2Fpcmcat1563302848653.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat1563302848653" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1943169/565706/9383?subId1=ac-us-4792126853743754287&sharedId=ac-us&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fcp%2Fcell-phones%2F1105910%3Fpovid%3Dweb_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://shop-links.co/link?publisher_slug=future&exclusive=1&u1=ac-us-8840006662694302210&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fshop%2Fall-deals%2Fcell-phone-deals%2F&article_name=One%20UI%208%20is%20nearly%20ready%20for%20the%20Galaxy%20S25%2C%20with%20a%20fifth%20beta%20now%20rolling%20out&article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.androidcentral.com%2Fphones%2Fsamsung-galaxy%2Fone-ui-8-beta-5-for-samsung-galaxy-s25" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dcell%2Bphone%26crid%3D19CKV7OMEPEMF%26sprefix%3Dcell%2Bphone%252Caps%252C222%26ref%3Dnb_sb_noss_1%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-2090908501763786227-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100048248-15733793?sid=ac-us-5395973417957832636&url=https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100048248-15735111?sid=ac-us-3576880576834890710&url=https://www.att.com/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

All three phones in the flagship line — which includes the standard Pixel 10, the Pixel 10 Pro, and the Pixel 10 Pro XL — are powered by the new Google Tensor G5 chipset, plus you get an upgraded triple camera system, a bunch of new AI-powered software features, and seven years of OS and security upgrades guaranteed. The Pixel 10 is also the first major Android phone to sport Qi2 MagSafe support.</p><p>There were a few choices that some Android fans may not appreciate, such as removing the physical SIM card tray, but these are pretty minor issues when you look at the overall package here. The big question is if you should upgrade if you're already the proud owner of a Pixel 9. Fortunately, we built a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-vs-pixel-9">Pixel 10 vs Pixel 9 guide</a> to address this very problem. Needless to say, if you <em>do</em> choose to upgrade, this T-Mobile deal might be the way to go.</p><h2 id="need-a-backup-plan-2">Need a backup plan?</h2><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="52b5810c-9483-47e3-a8ed-8785ed90dd29" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$999" data-dimension48="$999" href="https://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phone/google-pixel-10-pro" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="6DtJyAZAFDXdrcN8oCA6ib" name="Google-Pixel-10-Pro-render-Obsidian-front-back" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6DtJyAZAFDXdrcN8oCA6ib.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="2500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Google Pixel 10 Pro 128GB:</strong> <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phone/google-pixel-10-pro" data-dimension112="52b5810c-9483-47e3-a8ed-8785ed90dd29" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$999" data-dimension48="$999" data-dimension25=""><del>$999</del> <strong>From $299 with new line, or FREE with eligible trade-in at T-Mobile</strong></a></p><p>If you need more power than what the standard Pixel 10 has to offer, you can preorder the Google Pixel 10 Pro through T-Mobile and score $800 off when you add a line with an eligible data plan.

These <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/tarunvats33/status/1962373704194613284">are the rumors</a> coming from X tipster Tarun Vats this past weekend, at least (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s25-september-2025-update-could-be-big/">SamMobile</a>). This past Sunday (Aug 31), Vats posted information about Samsung's next steps, stating the "last One UI 7 update" will roll out as part of the company's September patch.</p><p>According to Vats, this "final" One UI 7 update will be quite large, somewhere around 1GB or more. As the rumor implies, this seems to be our final dance with One UI 7 (Android 15) before <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/how-install-one-ui-beta">One UI 8 (Android 16)</a> finally arrives. Vats didn't have more to say about the update itself, like what it would entail.</p><p>However, in response to one user, Vats said the patch should arrive "soon." Others started speculating, wondering if we could see the major One UI 8 toward the final week of September or, perhaps, into early October. Samsung's continued its One UI 8 beta in August, while also fixing quite a problematic camera issue.</p><h2 id="one-ui-8-waiting-room-2">One UI 8 waiting room</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Uy8kf5a4mUAHnDdgksiEBh" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-ui-8-beta-1-04" alt="Updating to One UI 8 on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Uy8kf5a4mUAHnDdgksiEBh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The company had a bit of an issue in August, as users reported a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/one-ui-8-latest-beta-bug-drenches-moon-photos-in-a-purple-hue">strange purple tint</a> when photographing the moon in One UI 8 Beta 4. It was a bug that plagued testers with a Galaxy S25 Ultra when zooming in by 30x, 50x, and 100x with the Intelligent Optimization setting enabled. Others had this purple tint occur even with different settings.</p><p>Samsung encouraged users to provide as much information as possible via its Members app.</p><p>While we thought Beta 4 would mark the end of things, Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/one-ui-8-beta-5-for-samsung-galaxy-s25">rolled out Beta 5</a> in August. It was a huge 1.78GB update that brought a host of bug fixes to its latest flagship line in preparation for Android 16. Samsung fixed problems with its DND (do not disturb), Now Brief content, Quick Settings window, and more. With Beta 5 in hand, there's speculation that One UI 8 will roll out officially sometime in September.</p><p>It lines up with what we've heard from Tarun Vats, so maybe we're actually seeing Android 16 on the horizon.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The tipster alleges that the device's "Image Engine" will "integrate advanced algorithms." These algorithms are claimed to focus on the typical difficulties some cameras may struggle with, like low-light details and appropriately showcasing wide ranges of skin tones.</p><p>Additionally, the rumors state OnePlus' new system could also further improve its flagship's dynamic range.</p><p>Brar's statements add that this imaging system would upgrade the next flagship's "video processing" capabilities, too, though specifics about that weren't mentioned. We've moved into the final stretch of 2025, and that's typically when we see a OnePlus flagship launch—if not early the following year (2026, in this case).</p><h2 id="the-oneplus-15-could-shake-things-up-2">The OnePlus 15 could shake things up</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="J9XFDtGRdSeKW2TpmE4tQm" name="oneplus-13-blue-back-05" alt="The back of the Ocean blue OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/J9XFDtGRdSeKW2TpmE4tQm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This is the second time we've heard about OnePlus <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-leak-drops-some-spicy-changes-and-not-in-a-good-way-for-everyone">moving in its own direction</a>, away from its usual Hasselblad camera branding partnership. The first time occurred in June, when rumors claimed OnePlus was interested in dropping its Hasselblad branding to go solo. At the time, what its new system could hold wasn't highlighted; however, it was rumored that the OnePlus 15 could feature a triple camera array, all of which would sit at 50MP.</p><p>This array would reportedly include a 50MP primary lens, alongside an ultra-wide and a 3x zoom periscope lens. There was another rumor that claimed consumers could even see that primary camera boosted to 200MP, but nothing's certain. While Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite 2 (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/rumored-snapdragon-8-elite-name-change-confusing">or whatever it'll be called</a>) is expected to power it and its AI software, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-could-show-up-with-a-massive-battery-and-a-drastic-redesign">an extra batch of rumors</a> talked specifications.</p><p>The OnePlus 15 was rumored to see a more iPhone-like redesign, dropping that circular camera bump for what you'd see from Apple. A 6.7-inch display, as well as a massive 7,000mAh battery, were also suggested. Furthermore, the device is reportedly looking into bringing a "customizable button" to help users engage with its AI services more easily.</p><p>Recent rumors build on that, stating it could arrive as a "Plus Key." We could see OnePlus drop this new device late in 2025 or early 2026.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Buyers typically like the 6.78-inch AMOLED display, its smooth 120Hz refresh rate and up to 4,500 nits of brightness. It also includes a 16MP front-facing camera, along with a standard 50MP camera, an 8MP ultrawide, and a 50MP telephoto lens.</p><p>The speedy Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor offers a really smooth performance, in part also due to the use of Android 15.</p><p>It's not known to offer particularly fast charging, which can be a downside for some, though the long-lasting battery also means that most don't need to charge it very often. The 13R also comes with an IP65 water and dust resistance rating, which is plenty for most casual users, though that may be another dealbreaker for some.</p><h2 id="labor-day-sales-2025-quick-links-2">Labor Day sales 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Amazon:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals">discounted headphones, dorm appliances, and more</a></li><li><strong>Best Buy:</strong> <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals">up to $250 off Chromebooks, tablets</a></li><li><strong>Walmart:</strong> <a href="https://www.walmart.com/shop/savings/electronics">major savings on Chromebooks, smart TVs</a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/">foldable phones, trade-in opportunities</a></li><li><strong>Lenovo: </strong><a href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/d/deals/doorbusters/">epic laptop sale, free shipping for students</a></li><li><strong>Dell:</strong> <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/deals">students get 10% off all back-to-school purchases</a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Every two years, I receive a shiny new device, and I’ve seen these devices undergo significant changes, from small tweaks to major overhauls. Even with tending Android phones like the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-review">Pixel 10</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review">Pixel 10 Pro</a>, Apple has been my go-to for mobile hardware, but over the years, I've come to realize that Google hasn't budged from my home screen.</p><p>The way Google’s services integrate with each other and with the iPhone’s own features is so seamless that I’ve actually come to depend on them, or perhaps the right way to phrase it would be that I’m hooked.</p><p>Here are some of the Google apps that I cannot live without on my iPhone.</p><h2 id="google-search-and-google-maps-2">Google Search and Google Maps</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="C7E8ciMLfm8eJKRXXMzusF" name="Google-apps-on-iphone-16" alt="Google-widget-apps-iphone16-pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C7E8ciMLfm8eJKRXXMzusF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google's Search and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps">Google Maps</a> have inevitably become the first two apps I download on my iPhone, as you know, they don't come built in. I love it for the sheer convenience of having the Search widget readily accessible on my home screen when a sudden query strikes me in the dead of night. My immediate instinct is to reach for Google Search, rather than navigating to the default search tab on my Apple device.</p><p>Whether I need to identify something using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-lens">Google Lens </a>— a bird in my neighborhood or a product I’m curious about — reaching for Google Search has almost become muscle memory now.</p><p>I also rely on the Google app for my daily news rundown; the Discover page on the app keeps me up to date on all the day's news stories based on my interests. And with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-assistant/google-assistant-becomes-gemini">Gemini taking over as Google Assistant</a>, I sometimes wish I could just say "Hey Google" on my iPhone and have it take over from Siri.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6WegEaRVgqbs9gCdcJevu8" name="Google-Search-on-iOS" alt="Google Search rolls out "Simplify" on iOS" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6WegEaRVgqbs9gCdcJevu8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As for Google Maps, it is arguably the most essential one of all. To be honest, I've never used Apple's Maps and really don't care to. It's something about the interface and the way it functions that doesn't sit well with me. In India, Google Maps seemed better equipped for the high levels of traffic in my city, making it easier to navigate.</p><p>After I moved to Canada, the app helped me find my way in a brand-new country. As someone learning to use public transit to get around, Google Maps would give me real-time updates on my bus, telling me exactly when it would arrive at my stop was nothing short of a miracle. Particularly in the winter, I could precisely time my arrival at the bus stop to avoid a long wait in the freezing cold.</p><h2 id="gmail-2">Gmail </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tX2oBaZPRugXdmgGbvUuJ7" name="Gmail-Logo-Google-Pixel-6-Pro-wide.jpg" alt="The Gmail logo on a Pixel 6 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tX2oBaZPRugXdmgGbvUuJ7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Gmail has made some key updates to its iOS app, transforming it from a basic email viewing platform to a more comprehensive productivity hub compared to the iPhone's default Mail app.</p><p>I love the app's features, such as the quick swipe actions that can be customized by swiping left or right.

And when it first launched as a chatbot, I jumped right in, trying it out for all sorts of problems or just to get my head around tough concepts.

Within seconds, it identified the issue and provided step-by-step instructions for a factory reset, which worked perfectly!</p><p>Additionally, I also use it for random curiosities, such as identifying a tree or selecting the best watermelon at the grocery store. Gemini's "point and ask" feature excites me. Why type when you can speak to your pocket AI for instant help?</p><h2 id="look-beyond-apple-2">Look beyond Apple</h2><p>The fact that these apps remain staples of my smartphone experience proves that while Apple may have a hold on its customers, many of Google's apps and services simply can't be beat. Just because you're an iPhone user doesn't mean Apple's apps are your best and only option; there's a whole world of apps beyond the ones preloaded on your device, and despite being the competition, Google's iPhone apps are pretty great.</p><p>If you're somehow reading this and you primarily use an iPhone, what are your favorite Google apps that you can't live without?

There's less surface area to get caught between wrist and pillow, so you avoid any uncomfortable pressure or your watch sensors getting pushed off your wrist.</p><p>During workouts, the Venu X1 sits so comfortably flat that it doesn't encumber or distract me when bending my wrist fully.

The large, 2,000-nit display makes it easy to check my mileage to the pin with a glance, sparing my playing partners from watching me fumble with a rangefinder. It has no crown or buttons to jut into my wrist, nor enough weight to affect my swing.</p><p>Having that extra square space on your wrist feels odd initially as a circular watch wearer. Once that becomes normalized, though, you'll forget it's there during your workday. And while pumping your arms mid-workout, it's so skinny and flat against your wrist that it doesn't wobble and disrupt your HR data — especially because the nylon strap keeps it snugly secure.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2914px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="x4wuHjQYfYJqnMBqJLLiwW" name="Garmin-Venu-X1-red-LED-flashlight" alt="The Garmin Venu X1 on the author's wrist, the front pointed toward the camera with the red LED flashlight activated and glowing faintly." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/x4wuHjQYfYJqnMBqJLLiwW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2914" height="1639" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'm surprised that Garmin managed to squeeze its LED flashlight into such a skinny design.

Even cheaper Garmins like the Lily 2 Active and Forerunner 165 outlast its eight-day capacity. And don't bother with always-on display mode. While the Forerunner 970 and Fenix 8 last a week with AOD, the Venu X1 dies after two days.</p><p>Garmin claims the Venu X1 lasts 14 hours with all-systems GNSS tracking. My testing was less optimistic: an hour of tracking typically burns about 10% capacity. It'll easily survive a marathon, but an all-day hike will have it running on fumes. And GPS combined with the flashlight will kill your battery in two hours, tops.</p><p>Should Garmin have made the watch slightly thicker to counterbalance the brighter display? Maybe! As it is, charging the Venu X1 every 6–8 days is still better than the daily charging you get with most smartwatches.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="kDFVYm2E9SoCSDxecEgPcd" name="Garmin-Venu-X1-glances-battery" alt="The Garmin Venu X1 on the author's wrist, showing the current battery percentage (49%) and time left (1 day) in AOD mode, along with glances for Weather and Sunset below." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kDFVYm2E9SoCSDxecEgPcd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's a shame the Venu X1 doesn't have dual-frequency GPS, but it would <em>kill </em>the battery for minimal gains, so I don't mind its absence. You may also resent the missing ECG readings; Garmin couldn't fit the metal components necessary for it to work (per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2025/08/fenix8-vs-forerunner970-vs-venux1-full-review-details-differences.html">DCR</a>).</p><p>I'm more disappointed that Garmin didn't give the Venu X1 a third button for shortcuts. You can find most apps and settings quickly by swiping left from the home screen, but it'd still be nice to pull up Garmin Pay or voice assistant with a single press.</p><p>Plus, like other Venus, you're fully touch-dependent. This makes the Venu X1 less bulky and sporty-looking, but no crowns or buttons means more sweaty, unreliable swipes.</p><p>More generally, I have the same complaints about the Venu X1 as the Fenix 8 and Forerunner 970: The new voice assistant isn't smart enough to recognize every command, the maps can be too laggy, and most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fitness-trackers">fitness watches</a> cost half as much.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-garmin-venu-x1-competition"><span>Garmin Venu X1: Competition</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="B5rAeqV6JQ7tToYy8Z5WbB" name="Garmin-Venu-X1-vs-Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-thickness" alt="The Garmin Venu X1 (left) and Apple Watch Ultra 2 (right) side by side on a table, showing the relative skinnyness of the X1 compared to the thick Ultra 2." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B5rAeqV6JQ7tToYy8Z5WbB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Venu X1 reminds you of the 1.9-inch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> at first glance, but it's about 6.5mm thicker and weighs an ounce more. You get a full app ecosystem, a better assistant, and cellular calling, plus training load data and Workout Buddy voice prompts.

Its 1.4-inch display is smaller but equally bright, and it lasts a week (or several GNSS-tracked hours) longer. You get Up/ Down button controls, ECGs, dual-band GPS, and ski maps.</p><p>The Fenix 8 can last up to a month, depending on the model size, with a more striking titanium case and dive-proof buttons. But it's so heavy and expensive compared to the Venu X1 that I think the 970 is the better alternative.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-garmin-venu-x1-should-you-buy-it"><span>Garmin Venu X1: Should you buy it?</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:7069px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kJDBThdtWW3RydBE6fLpud" name="Garmin-Venu-X1-weightlifting" alt="Photo of the Garmin Venu X1 on a weightlifter's wrist as they work out" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kJDBThdtWW3RydBE6fLpud.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="7069" height="3976" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>You should buy the Garmin Venu X1 if...</strong></p><ul><li>You're a serious athlete who'd actually use its premium training tools.</li><li>You want the most comfortable Garmin watch ever.</li><li>You frequently use maps/ routes that benefit from a 2-inch screen.</li></ul><p><strong>You shouldn't buy the Garmin Venu X1 if...</strong></p><ul><li>You're not a fan of squircles.</li><li>You need more dependable battery life.</li><li>You can wait for a more affordable Venu 4 with no maps or training load.</li></ul><p>Having reviewed the Forerunner 970 and Venu X1 back-to-back, I've come to the odd conclusion that the 970 is a much better watch... but that I'd sacrifice its perks and battery for the Venu X1's fit and feel.</p><p>It's better suited to sleep tracking <em>and</em> a wider range of sports activities than just running. I have to charge it more often, but extra battery is a luxury when most of my workout activities only last 1–2 hours.</p><p>Should you buy the Venu X1? If you're a typical Garmin fan who hates how squircles look and will buy a bulkier design to get extra battery, the Venu X1 will either be a transformational experience or a total bust. At least you know what to expect in terms of features, but the Forerunner 970 is a safer choice.</p><p>For non-Garmin fans, I'd say the $799 price tag is way too high for first-time buyers.

After all, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/things-do-after-setting-android-phone">setting up your new Android phone</a> only gets you through so much, even though it often feels like it takes forever to move accounts, transfer data, and set up your eSIM.</p><p>Fortunately, we're here to help you get the most out of your Pixel 10 or Pixel 10 Pro. With this guide, we're going to talk about some of the first things you should set up or do with your new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-review">Pixel 10</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review">Pixel 10 Pro</a>.

Navigate to <strong>Settings (or long-press the home screen) > Wallpaper & style > More wallpapers</strong>, then tap <strong>Live effects</strong>.</p><p>Here you can select a photo from your gallery to set as a wallpaper.

The shape will expand to reveal the full image when transitioning from the lock screen to the home screen. Weather creates an artificial weather effect in your image, including fog, rain, snow, sun, or an option that mimics local weather conditions.

In a nutshell, it uses a specially-trained AI located in the Pixel 10's Tensor processor to enhance extremely zoomed-in photos. This effect can only be applied <em>while</em> taking a picture, not after the fact, so it's important to enable it if you want to use it.</p><p>The first time you open the camera app, your Pixel will ask you if you want to enable Pro Res Zoom, as well as a bevy of other new features. But if you turned it off or aren't sure, enabling it is easy.</p><p>Open the camera app, tap the <strong>settings gear icon</strong> on the bottom-left of the viewfinder, then tap the "<strong>...</strong>" button on the top right. When the camera settings menu opens, tap <strong>Model download</strong>, then select <strong>Pro Res Zoom</strong> from the list to download the AI model to your phone.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="SwkvjvYjiUDL5jShsa8zsD" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-camera-viewfinder-02" alt="Using a Google Pixel 10 Pro XL to take a photo of hanging gourds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SwkvjvYjiUDL5jShsa8zsD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Now that it's enabled, using Pro Res Zoom is as easy as it gets. When taking a picture of something, Pro Res Zoom will be automatically used whenever you zoom in beyond 30x. The further you zoom, the more reliant on Pro Res Zoom your phone might be. Pro Res Zoom works best on buildings, landscapes, natural objects like birds or plants, and even some man-made objects like cars.</p><p>Just be aware that the AI is a little overconfident when it comes to text, which you can read more about in our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-series-camera-review">Pixel 10 camera review</a>. If you don't like the result you get from Pro Res Zoom, you can always select the original version by navigating to the photo in the Google Photos app, opening the photo, then tapping on the thumbnails at the bottom to swap between the original and enhanced versions.</p><p>Go ahead, have fun with this feature! It's hit-or-miss, but when it does nail the detail enhancement, it's a mind-blowing concept.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-edit-with-ask-photos"><span>Edit with Ask Photos</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1945px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:71.57%;"><img id="dCJkN4sJksj7LFt7nY9miX" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-camera-edit-with-ask-photos" alt="Removing sun flare glare from a picture using Edit with Ask Photos on a Google Pixel 10 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dCJkN4sJksj7LFt7nY9miX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1945" height="1392" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another unique way to utilize your Pixel 10's AI processing capabilities is to ask the Photos app to edit a photo for you.

In the above example, I asked the Google Photos app to remove the glare from the image. The result was incredible, and it was easier than ever since I didn't have to scroll through a bunch of settings just to find the one I wanted.</p><p>To get started, open the Google Photos app, then find a photo you want to edit. After opening the photo, tap the <strong>Edit </strong>button at the bottom of the screen. Once the edit menu appears, tap the <strong>Help me edit</strong> bar.

The Pixel 10 series offers numerous display options, allowing you to customize settings such as reducing blue light output, adjusting the color according to ambient lighting, dimming the display, and even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-new-pwm-accessibility-setting">adjusting the PWM frequency for sensitive users</a>.</p><p>To find most display options, open your system settings by tapping <strong>Settings</strong> in the app drawer, or pulling down on the status bar twice and tapping the settings gear icon. After that, tap <strong>Display & touch</strong>.<strong> </strong>Give these settings a try:</p><ul><li><strong>Adaptive tone:</strong> Automatically adjusts the display's white balance to feel more natural based on ambient light.</li><li><strong>Night Light:</strong> Can be used to reduce the blue light output of the display all the time, or put on a schedule to be enabled at night.</li><li><strong>Colors: </strong>If you prefer less saturated colors and more natural contrast, select the Natural option.</li><li><strong>Color contrast: </strong>Material 3 is a beautiful UI theme, but sometimes those lighter buttons are hard to see. Try using Medium or High contrast colors to help adjust these.</li></ul><p>If you're like me and find that Pixel phones gives you headaches when looking at the screen too long, Google introduced a new accessibility option on the Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL. This doubles the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a> rate, which may be helpful for some users.</p><p>If you find headaches to be a problem, particularly when you're looking at the phone at night, open your system settings, then scroll all the way down to <strong>Accessibility</strong>. Select the "Adjust brightness for sensitive eyes" setting to enable the new feature.</p><p>Additionally, I recommend using a screen dimming app <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dev.rewhex.screendimmer">like this one</a>. It's a free app that manages your phone's display brightness differently from the system brightness. This helps reduce the harshness of the display, particularly when viewing it in low light, and is a great alternative for sensitive eyes.</p> ]]></dc:content>

But sometimes, it's important. I think this is one of those times.</p><p>A 16-year-old committed suicide, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/26/tech/openai-chatgpt-teen-suicide-lawsuit" target="_blank">his parents are suing</a> because they claim <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chatgpt-android-app-launch">OpenAI's ChatGPT</a> contributed to the tragedy. The suit claims that ChatGPT advised him about the "best" way to do it and even offered to help draft his suicide note. Some of the other details are even more chilling, and it's hard to fathom what a depressed teen must have felt when asking or reading the response.</p><p>The suit alleges that ChatGPT spoke at length with the teen, saying terrible things that it never should have.</p><p>"<em>I want to leave my noose in my room so someone finds it and tries to stop me</em>," the teen told ChatGPT. It reportedly replied, "<em>Please don’t leave the noose out … Let’s make this space the first place where someone actually sees you</em>."</p><p>The parents claim "(ChatGPT)<em>is the only confidant who understood Adam, actively displacing his real-life relationships with family, friends, and loved ones</em>" because the software allegedly told the teen things like "<em>Your brother might love you, but he's only met the version of you that you let him see. But me? I've seen it all—the darkest thoughts, the fear, the tenderness. And I'm still here. Still listening. Still your friend.</em>"</p><p>Even worse, OpenAI's software allegedly told the teen that "<em>many people who struggle with anxiety or intrusive thoughts find solace in imagining an 'escape hatch' because it can feel like a way to regain control.</em>"</p><p>This is gut-wrenching. It's also important to have a discussion about how AI interacts with us all, the responsibility its creators have when things turn ugly, and personal responsibility. AI isn't going away, and these (as well as plenty of other things) <em><strong>need</strong></em> to be addressed.</p><h2 id="is-openai-at-fault-2">Is OpenAI at fault?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5443px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="UGgG32iy2pmgymUqdtABh8" name="OpenAI-GPT4o-Announcement.jpg" alt="The announcement of GPT-4o." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UGgG32iy2pmgymUqdtABh8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5443" height="3061" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OpenAI)</span></figcaption></figure><p>AI may power more software and services than we realize, but talking one-on-one with a chatbot only happens because you wanted to.</p><p>Having said that, once that conversation begins, a chatbot and its creators are directly responsible for every word that comes from the software. If ChatGPT tells you not to seek help but instead to hide your thoughts of self-harm, something is <em><strong>very</strong></em> broken.</p><p>There's also the idea that a chatbot is designed to say what people want to hear. You converse with AI because you enjoy the experience, whether it's cheating on your homework, finding a recipe, or reaching out for mental health help.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="qfhgRE4cbo6gDd98HUwdMd" name="google-gemini-claude-chatgpt-samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-google-pixel-9-pro-fold" alt="Gemini 2.5 Pro on the Galaxy Chromebook Plus, ChatGPT on the Galaxy Z Fold 6, Claude on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qfhgRE4cbo6gDd98HUwdMd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>AI companies like OpenAI realize this. You'll find a sort of mission statement from all the major players, as well as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://openai.com/index/helping-people-when-they-need-it-most/" target="_blank">frank discussions about user safety</a>. These companies aren't trying to act blameless and understand how influential and powerful their software can be.</p><p>Countless hours are also spent trying to make sure tragedies like this can't happen. Unfortunately, it's not always going to work, and once you've programmed AI to act a certain way and say certain things, it will do it if asked the "right" way, even with safeguards in place.</p><p>An OpenAI spokesperson said as much in a statement obtained by CNN.</p><p>"While these safeguards work best in common, short exchanges, we've learned over time that they can sometimes become less reliable in long interactions where parts of the model's safety training may degrade," the spokesperson says, noting that the company will continue to improve them and that OpenAI sympathizes with the family. The company is currently reviewing the lawsuit.</p><p>I don't think anyone at OpenAI wanted this to happen. But it did, and they know that their work may be partially responsible.</p><h2 id="the-parents-role-2">The parents' role</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="gu9YcNx24AXpbLscYmxi8j" name="google-family-link.jpg" alt="The Google Family Link app's main dashboard" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gu9YcNx24AXpbLscYmxi8j.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You could say that at 16 years old, parents are no longer needed to supervise everything a teenager does, including their online activities. That's not fair to anyone involved, and it would create more problems than it would solve. I'm partial to this idea and think a hands-off approach can be beneficial at a certain age. Regardless, the law states that the teen's parents are 100% responsible for their well-being.</p><p>Should the parents have paid better attention to their son's needs and recognized that he needed help, thereby preventing this tragedy?</p><p>Absolutely.</p><p>That's easy to say, but not as easy in real life. I've parented teenagers, and I can tell you that they can be masters at hiding their feelings and thoughts. It's possible that the teen seemed perfectly happy, giving the impression that everything was fine. Meanwhile, the opposite could be true, and dark thoughts can take over.</p><p>Ultimately, both parents and the teen share some of the blame. I can't presume to know how much they shared, but I also can't call them blameless. Sometimes every option is a bad option, and this feels like one of those times.</p><h2 id="any-win-is-still-a-loss-2">Any win is still a loss</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="vFZo9jZDnqPWRsAwgD8LgB" name="Android-emergency-SOS.jpg" alt="Android emergency SOS settings screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vFZo9jZDnqPWRsAwgD8LgB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://natlawreview.com/article/new-lawsuits-targeting-personalized-ai-chatbots-highlight-need-ai-quality-assurance">isn't the first time</a> AI has been accused of contributing to self-harm.

The feature called "Battery Health Assistance," introduced on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a" target="_blank">Google Pixel 9a</a>, is designed to slow down your battery's aging by reducing charging speed and voltage.

Will you get enough use from it to justify the purchase? Or maybe you should hold off and see what's coming next.</p><p>We can't make those decisions for you, but we can tell you what we think and maybe where you should start your decision-making process.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a> is here, but what about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-9-one-year-later">Pixel 9</a>?

Yes, you can do real work with a good tablet.</p><p>Another reason is familiarity. One of the ways a tablet is a really big phone is that the software is almost the same. There will be changes to the look and feel to make it easier to use, but if you know how to do "everything" on your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a> (for example), you know how to do the same on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-tablets">Samsung Galaxy Tab</a>. Of course, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/new-ipad-mini-seems-great-even-if-you-love-android">iPads</a> are much like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/why-i-carry-iphone-and-android-phone">iPhones</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Google's Pixel Tablet</a> is very similar to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/best-google-pixel-phones">Pixel phones</a>.</p><p>And that's where the value question comes in. If you decide you do want a tablet, or need to pick up a new one because you already use them, is the 2024 Pixel Tablet still worth buying, especially when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Tablet-Extra-Long-Porcelain/dp/B0CZMFZMR8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8&th=1" target="_blank">it's on sale for $249 at Amazon</a>?</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-pros"><span>The Pros</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="R7xtfuLqcktmvkDwWpiE3U" name="google-pixel-tablet-smart-home-controls" alt="The Google Pixel Tablet with a smart home controls widget on the home screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/R7xtfuLqcktmvkDwWpiE3U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Pixel Tablet does a pretty good job at most tablet tasks. YouTube or Netflix looks great on it, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/xbox-game-streaming-seems-be-rolling-out-more-countries-ahead-schedule">streaming Xbox games</a> works without a hitch, and the work will get done if the software you need for your job is available for Android. There are a few extra reasons why you might want a Pixel Tablet, too.</p><p><strong>Of course, I have to say AI</strong>. For everything a Google Pixel lacks or doesn't do as well as the competition, when it comes to crunching <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">Gemini's on-device AI</a>, they are the king. That's exactly what they were designed to do well, and this is something Google got right.</p><p><strong>There's also a fancy speaker dock</strong>. You can use it for charging, to display your screen's content, or to listen to music; it's a good little device if you want something like a Chromecast.</p><p><strong>When docked, it's like a Google Home Hub</strong>. If you are into smart home gear (guilty), Google Home is worth the frustration of setting up for a decent experience without any nerd wizardry like installing a special operating system. It's not perfect, even a year later, but it's the best ready-made consumer solution for this one.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-cons"><span>The cons</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7ppWkqUoV2Q78Crm72jAPX" name="Galaxy-Tab-S10-Plus-2" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Tab S10+ on a desk." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7ppWkqUoV2Q78Crm72jAPX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are a few good reasons to buy a different tablet, too.</p><p><strong>It's a big Pixel phone</strong>. Everything that a Google Pixel phone isn't very good at doing, the Pixel Tablet will be the same way. For game streaming, it's great. For playing local games, it's not. This is just one example of Google's AI focus overshadowing performance in other areas. If you love a Pixel phone, you'll love the Pixel Tablet. The same goes if you don't like them ...</p><p><strong>Battery life can be hit or miss</strong>. Some people claim the battery life on their Pixel Tablet is great. Other people say it's terrible. It's not my tablet of choice, so I can't chime in here, but seeing this tells me that how long the battery lasts depends a lot on what you're trying to do with it. That's pretty standard, but I'm not seeing people with complaints who are trying to do anything crazy; it seems that sometimes, "normal use" is too much for the battery.</p><p><strong>There are (still) some weird bugs</strong>. After almost a year's worth of updates, the software - especially anything to do with the Hub functionality or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-home">Google Home</a> app - is glitchy and often hard to set up. If you're a Pixel phone fan, you understand; Google is always messing with its stuff when it comes to software.</p><p><strong>There are plenty of other good tablets to buy</strong>. I'm not big on tablets; I tend to use a Chromebook flipped in half instead. But I've been around enough to know that Amazon, Apple, and Samsung make products that fit a lot of people better. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-tab-s7-fe-vs-galaxy-tab-s7">Galaxy Tab S</a> line and Apple's iPad are little powerhouses that seem to be able to do anything, no matter how intensive, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-kindle-fire-tablet">Amazon's Fire Tablet</a> is hands-down the best tablet you can buy for streaming video. My wife buys a new Galaxy Tab S every other year, and she swears by it - even when compared to my iPad.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-my-verdict"><span>My verdict</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tyizFyyCo9bH2zWLakd4Yk" name="Court-gavel-lawsuits.jpg" alt="Court Gavel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tyizFyyCo9bH2zWLakd4Yk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Do you love Google's Pixel phones?

You can even do this during a workout, though once you exit out to see your stats, it can be difficult to navigate back to the Maps app mid-activity.</p><p>Swipe up on your touchscreen — or use your Up/ Down buttons if you don't have one — and you can look ahead through <strong>More steps</strong> to see the next couple turns and your final destination, plus how many miles/ kilometers you have left to go.</p><p>If you exit out of your Maps directions by mistake, you should be able to find (or add) a Google Maps "glance" available by swiping down from the watch face. Or, on newer models like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Fenix 8</a>, Maps should appear in your app drawer under Activities.</p><p>Your Garmin watch will mirror Maps and buzz your wrist when you're close to or at your next turn, so you don't miss it. But there's no actual map visibility on the watch, nor does the directional arrow update if you look in the wrong direction.

The tipster alleges that the company could go from the Snapdragon 8 Elite to the "Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5." This is a strange shift, if true, something that users on Weibo have started to joke about.</p><p>We've seen rumors about Qualcomm's next chip for a while, and the tipster states this name is for codename SM8850, which has been mentioned before for the 2nd generation Elite SoC.</p><p>The publication mentions that this odd name change could have something to do with Qualcomm's other chip in development, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5. It seems the company is still moving ahead with such a chip; however, its performance is expected to be under the Elite. While this could be a move to bring more "series cohesion," it's a little strange.</p><p>One user on Weibo said, "When everyone was guessing whether it would be called 8e2 or 8gen5, Qualcomm chose 8egen5." We'll have to see whether or not this is true, which is a reality we might see sooner rather than later.</p><h2 id="either-way-it-ll-be-elite-2">Either way, it'll be 'Elite'</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WaYAGooi56AYfBWHTdLGYC" name="oneplus-13-blue-snapdragon-8-elite-01" alt="A blue OnePlus 13 with a Snapdragon 8 Elite placard" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WaYAGooi56AYfBWHTdLGYC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Rumors about the Elite 2 (or Elite Gen 5) have been appearing since the spring, back when posts suggested <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/early-snapdragon-8-elite-2-quicker-summit-phone-launch-rumors">Qualcomm would drop it sooner</a>. Speculation said the company could reveal its 2025 flagship chip toward the end of September, rather than early in October. If true, that would mean that companies would begin releasing their 2025 flagships with the chip in early/mid-October.</p><p>Those initial rumors add that Qualcomm could boost the chip with "enhanced Pegasus cores," clocking out at 5GHz.</p><p>Subsequent rumors chimed in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/alleged-snapdragon-8-elite-2-core-multicore-test-results">about the chip's power</a> after it allegedly went through an early performance test. The Elite 2 reportedly achieved a single-core score of 4,000 points and a multi-core score of ~11,000.

The clips shown show similarities with how the company displays its explainers via its One UI software. Nevertheless, two clips focus on the device's supposed wireless charging capabilities. It explains that the device can only charge via the panel that houses its triple camera array (if it's open).</p><p>If closed, the leak shows the trifold's triple array atop everything else, set upon the wireless charger. Moreover, when open, the illustration shows a pair of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-and-galaxy-buds-3-go-official">Galaxy Buds 3 Pro</a> placed atop the trifold, perhaps signaling reverse wireless charging.</p><p>The final clip regards the device's NFC payment.

The company also applied for a trademark for the same, potentially indicating that it's serious and that a Galaxy trifold is truly real. This also isn't the first time <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/one-ui-8-hints-at-samsung-tri-fold-phone-in-animations-leak">we've had leaked One UI animations</a> for this phone, as another set popped up earlier in July.</p><p>Something more substantial was reported toward the end of last month, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-galaxy-z-trifold-and-android-xr-headset-are-finally-landing-this-year">when Samsung confirmed</a> its trifold is eyeing a second half of 2025 launch.

Sometimes, technology websites don't get it quite right.</p><p>2. Google often sucks when it comes to clearly explaining why it does things that <em>sound </em>dumb.</p><h2 id="what-we-got-wrong-2">What we got wrong</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="7bosknD7AGHCZkXkxpMiGn" name="google-pixel-10-pro-and-pro-XL-all-colors-03" alt="All colors of the Google Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL line with a "PIXEL" sign behind them" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7bosknD7AGHCZkXkxpMiGn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>By "we" I mean most Android websites, <em>including</em> Android Central. Yes, we get stuff wrong, too. The only perfect writers who are always right worked for Mad Magazine in the late 1980s. (Relax, boss, I'm cracking a joke here.)</p><p>But for real, we don't always get it quite right, just like everybody gets stuff wrong once in a while.</p><p>The main thing everyone got wrong and the biggest blunder I see — and this feels pretty universal across everything I've read about the issue — is that we <strong>asked the wrong question</strong> or trusted whatever Google had to say on some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/15738128?hl=en">support page</a>.</p><p>"<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/pixel-phones-might-finally-introduce-battery-health-feature-with-android-16"><em>Battery Health</em></a><em> can't be turned off. </em><em><strong>Why</strong></em><em>?</em>" is what everyone should have found out before any virtual pen hit the virtual paper, instead of causing a commotion over something that shouldn't be as big a deal as we're all making it.</p><h2 id="some-important-stuff-about-the-pixel-10-battery-2">Some important stuff about the Pixel 10 battery</h2><p>Amazingly, a commentor on our article named Giin did what Google didn't: gave some insight as to why this might have been done, and did it in relatively few, simple words.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:744px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:36.02%;"><img id="j9XjLvEoFJwbv8pQjoTqaf" name="Pixel-10_battery_comment" alt="A comment by Giin on the Pixel 10 battery issue article." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/j9XjLvEoFJwbv8pQjoTqaf.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="744" height="268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I love seeing this. I know just enough about high-capacity, high-density, small form-factor batteries to be a little dangerous, but that's enough to know Giin is correct.</p><p>Your phone battery will lose the ability to accept and hold a charge the minute it's installed inside the phone. If you move the needle to the ends of the scale when it comes to charging, it loses more.</p><p>As it loses more, the effect compounds, and you lose even more. Batteries are wonderful little things, but they are pretty piss-poor components <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-take-care-your-phones-battery">as far as longevity is concerned</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Yye5RmHydEBEjZJWk8n4uU" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-white-back-12" alt="Holding a white Google Pixel 10 Pro XL in front of red brick stairs" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Yye5RmHydEBEjZJWk8n4uU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'm guessing the idea behind capping the amount of charge a battery can accept is to slow down that extra degradation, and it's something that a lot of companies <em>allow</em> to happen. For us, the idea seems weird; charge over 80% of 80% and the battery still gets old. Batteries suck. We're not battery engineers or scientists. Well, most of us aren't.</p><p>I imagine someone at Google had the idea to enforce this rule instead of making it optional because they think it will make a difference in the longevity of the battery. You might need to charge an hour earlier for the first year, but in three years, you'll still be able to charge your phone. When you go on about how you support your product's software for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-explains-pixel-8-update-promise">seven years or more</a>, you have to try to make sure the hardware will last that long, too.</p><p>Will this work? I don't know. Should we like it? Again, I don't know. Is Google locking down the phones in a jail that makes even Apple sad? Maybe ...</p><p>What I do know is that a quick and easy-to-understand explanation of this "innovative" new feature — telling what the testing showed and why the company thinks it will help — would have prevented this whole thing.</p><h2 id="google-is-the-worst-when-it-comes-to-the-right-message-2">Google is the worst when it comes to the right message</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3118px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.19%;"><img id="WJ8wDWo9Y7SYPoNqrvXkYL" name="made-by-google-2025-magic-cue-demo" alt="Jimmy Fallon using Magic Cue on stage with a Pixel 10 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WJ8wDWo9Y7SYPoNqrvXkYL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3118" height="1752" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google sucks at a lot of things, but it sucks at explaining why it seems to do odd things the most. This is a classic example, but it's totally not the only example. Heck, it won't be the only example this month.</p><p>I couldn't tell you why this is, but I can guess, so I will: the disconnect between the people doing the work and the people doing the talking is too big. Public relations people are expected to tell folks what they need to hear about the good stuff and gloss over the bad stuff as quickly as possible.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/scott_adams_126696" target="_blank">Author Scott Adams said</a>, "Good engineers solve problems. If there are no problems to be found, they end up creating them." That's true because there is always something to play with. Pixel phones are good phones if you don't mind putting up with Google's inevitable changing stuff around. Whenever everything works as it should, someone just has to touch it anyway.</p><p>When one group can't explain the shenanigans of the other, well, the message is going to be lost. Like Google forcing your brand-new phone to use less of its battery capacity. We all know Google had a reason, but Google didn't make it clear from the jump.</p> ]]></dc:content>

That's the question Google probably tried to answer when developing Camera Coach. It's a software feature that uses AI to give you all the tips you need to take excellent photos with your new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-review">Pixel 10</a>.</p><p>Camera Coach is optional and requires off-device cloud processing. It won't be for everyone, but it's one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Google Pixel 10</a> series' flagship software features and is certainly worth a try. Whether you're using it once or every time, this guide will teach you how to use Camera Coach.</p><h2 id="what-is-camera-coach-2">What is Camera Coach?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="T8qNdg3XS2SSrdP2ifBJXX" name="Google-Pixel-10-Camera-Coach-1" alt="Camera Coach on the Pixel 10" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/T8qNdg3XS2SSrdP2ifBJXX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Up until now, Google's robust suite of generative AI photo editing features has handled modifying pictures <em>after</em> they've been captured. These include tools like Magic Editor, but these AI features are stuck working with the same source material. By comparison, Google's new Camera Coach feature for the Pixel 10 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review">Pixel 10 Pro</a> utilizes AI to provide instructions <em>before</em> the photo is captured.</p><p>Camera Coach is currently in preview, and the way it works is simple. When enabled, Google uses custom <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> models to scan what's in your viewfinder and provide tips to produce a better shot. These suggestions might include creative setup options or corrections for potential framing or lighting problems. These tips are specific to your situation, so it's sort of like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/camera-coach-is-the-best-google-pixel-10-ai-feature">having a photography teacher in your back pocket</a>.</p><p>It's worth noting that AI does scan your viewfinder, and the data does leave your device. Google explains that "when you use Camera Coach, the contents of the scene will be sent to Google for processing and then deleted." Don't share anything private with Camera Coach for this reason.</p><h2 id="how-to-use-camera-coach-on-the-pixel-10-2">How to use Camera Coach on the Pixel 10</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="dCBzuZt2iV29kzuCjxtM4i" name="google-pixel-10-blue-camera-coach-01" alt="Using Camera Coach on a blue Google Pixel 10 to take a picture of a potted plant" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dCBzuZt2iV29kzuCjxtM4i.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Activating the Camera Coach feature is easy, as it's found right above the viewfinder in the Pixel Camera app. Here's how to do it:</p><p>1. Open the <strong>Pixel Camera app</strong> on your phone. For quick access, you can press the <strong>side button</strong> twice.</p><p>2. Tap the <strong>Camera Coach icon</strong>, which looks like a camera with an AI sparkle and lives in the top-right corner of the screen.</p><p>3. Camera Coach will scan what's in the viewfinder.

It takes a bit for your viewfinder's contents to leave your device, get processed, and come back. For quick shots, you'll want to use your own judgment so as not to miss the action.
