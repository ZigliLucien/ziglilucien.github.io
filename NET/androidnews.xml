<hr>
<p>Google is expanding access to its "photorealistic" video generator, Veo 2, today (Apr. 15) for Gemini users and Whisk testers.</p><p>Powered by Google's Veo 2 video generation model, its press release states its abilities are now arriving for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-is-gemini-advanced-worth-buying">Gemini Advanced</a> users globally. The company touts its AI model's ability to "translate text-based prompts into dynamic videos." Integrating with Gemini, Google says users can create videos ranging from short stories to visual concepts and "specific scenes." The feature relies heavily on the user's description, so those getting involved are encouraged to be as detailed as possible with Veo 2.</p><p>As it hits Gemini Advanced, users can select Veo 2's capabilities in the drop-down menu. After inputting your text description, the model will create a short, eight-second clip. The file will be provided in MP4 format with a 16:9 aspect ratio.</p><p>Users can take their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/googles-veo-2-becomes-widely-available-as-it-teases-gemini-2-5-flash">Veo 2</a> generated videos and share them. For mobile, Google directs users to the new "Share" button, which will let you upload your eight-second clip to YouTube Shorts and TikTok.</p><p>As this rolls out for Gemini Advanced users, Google states it's taking the safety of this video generator seriously and will continue to listen to user feedback. More importantly, safeguards are in place to ensure users cannot generate content that violates its policies. All videos generated in Veo 2 are marked with SynthID, giving awareness to all others that the content shown has been AI-generated.</p><p>Gemini Advanced users will also find a "monthly limit" on the number of videos you can have Veo 2 create. While the magic number wasn't stated, Google says Gemini will let you know when you're approaching your limit.</p>

<p>Veo 2 is also arriving in Google's current AI experiment, Whisk. The model's arrival introduces "Whisk Animate," to help users better visualize their ideas through AI generation. While Whisk testers are used to working with images, Google's Veo 2 update lets you take those photos and give them life — if life was an eight-second clip. Users should find vivid and bold colors in these short clips.</p><p>Whisk Animate, courtesy of Veo 2 is rolling out today (Apr. 15). Users can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://labs.google/fx/tools/whisk">give it a try</a>; however, it is restricted to global  Google One AI Premium subscribers.</p><p>Last December, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-ai-whisk-image-video-generation-updates">the company introduced</a> new updates for its Veo 2 and Imagen 3 models. That announcement also held the grand introduction of Whisk, an experimental AI test for Labs users. The model's tagline is "Prompt less, Play More," which is highlighted by Whisk's ability to opt to forgo text descriptions by providing images to fit its three requirements: subject, scene, and style.</p><p>Whisk will "consider" everything in those images to create a brand-new product for whatever you have in mind. At the time, Google highlighted that its AI could get crucial details wrong, like hair, skin tone, and the like. However, Whisk contains a "Review & Edit" button that users can utilize to push the AI to get things right.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Google Pixel devices are one of the few smartphones that you can readily identify from far away. The camera housing, whether a full bar on older Pixels or the newer oval shape, is immediately recognizable. That's why when Google ditched the iconic camera bar on the most recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">Pixel 9a</a>, it made waves. Some people love the move, but many more seem to hate it.</p><p>The company originally gave Android Central a few reasons it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/why-google-pixel-9a-ditched-camera-bar">decided to make the Pixel 9a nearly flat</a> at the camera bar's expense. Improved thermal performance, a larger batter capacity, and the need to give the Pixel 9a its own personality were at the top of the list.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="H5QcxrTXFDs6ZWZZYYtkKj" name="Pixel-9-vs-9a-5" alt="The Google Pixel 9a in Iris compared to the Pixel 9 in Peony." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/H5QcxrTXFDs6ZWZZYYtkKj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, Google has more to say on the change in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/pixel-9a-new-design-camera/" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p><p>"We wanted to have a physical interpretation that would match the personality of the device," said Soniya Jobanputra, a Pixel product manager.</p><p>Contrary to what you might think after seeing the Pixel 9a online or in photos, the camera bump isn't flush — it's referred to as a "dome" by the company. The design is said to mimic a water droplet, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> design. However, industrial designer Yomi Matsuoka notes that "if you put a case on it, there’s no bump at all."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="ZUhoVEZh4o7b7vFKrntuuf" name="Pixel-9a-Camera-Bump-Plans" alt="The experimental Pixel 9a camera bump designs tested by Google." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZUhoVEZh4o7b7vFKrntuuf.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="562" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Google tested these experimental Pixel 9a camera bump designs before settling on the final version.  </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It turns out that the Pixel 9a wasn't guaranteed to ditch the camera bar, or the more recent camera oval. It tested a few of them in experiments that "focused on [the camera bump's] overall form and appearance as well as certain shapes’ ability to withstand drops and impact." Eventually, the company settled on the Pixel 9a camera bump design we have today.</p>
<h2 id="the-reception-to-the-pixel-9a-s-design-is-odd-2">The reception to the Pixel 9a's design is odd</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="asxeqoV8jCKM9gVDtwZwx5" name="Google-Pixel-9a-Iris-2" alt="The Google Pixel 9a in Iris on a rock fixture." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/asxeqoV8jCKM9gVDtwZwx5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>People aren't thrilled with the Pixel 9a's design, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pixel_phones/comments/1iz9bnd/thoughts_on_the_pixel_9a/">multiple social media posts</a>. One user described their take on the phone, saying it "kinda looks like a colored brick with a weird camera shape." As someone with a Pixel 9a review unit, I'm qualified to say that take isn't exactly wrong. What's unusual about the public reception to the Pixel 9a's design is that Google seemingly gave customers exactly what they asked for.</p><p>The idea of removing the camera bump in favor of adding more battery has been around seemingly since the dawn of smartphones. More specifically, since phones universally accepted the idea of non-removal batteries and large camera bumps protruding from their rear casing. If you don't believe me, one Redditor pondered whether phones should just get thicker instead of sporting camera bumps six years ago on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pixel_phones/comments/cbwbd1/more_battery_instead_of_camera_bump/" target="_blank">Google Pixel subreddit</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pixel_phones/comments/cbwbd1/more_battery_instead_of_camera_bump">More battery instead of camera bump?</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pixel_phones">r/pixel_phones</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>This specific thread isn't an outlier, either. Multiple times per year, the concept of making phones thicker to incorporate more features and longer battery life trends on social media.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2836px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:42.67%;"><img id="tPuTm2zgQ34TyPkVZ7jXib" name="Google-Thicker-Phone-Searches" alt="Reddit threads about people wanting thicker phones." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tPuTm2zgQ34TyPkVZ7jXib.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2836" height="1210" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This time, Google actually listened. It made the Pixel 9a thicker, added more battery life, and swapped out camera sensors. The phone measures 8.9mm, has a giant 5,100mAh battery, and has an almost-flat design. On paper, the Pixel 9a — with multi-day battery life <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/i-spent-weeks-with-the-google-pixel-9a-and-the-pixel-9-you-should-buy-this-one">and a utilitarian design</a> — should've impressed enthusiasts who have been clamoring for this kind of thing for the better part of a decade.</p><p>The takeaway here isn't that the Pixel 9a design is perfect, because it's absolutely not perfect. It's boring and lacks the character that made Pixel phones popular in the first place. However, the design satisfies a long list of requests by smartphone buyers made for years, and that proves consumers don't always know that they want.</p>

<p>ESR is a good egg, with a versatile and affordable series of wireless chargers. I was big a fan of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/esr-qi2-car-charger">ESR Qi2 wireless car charger</a> because it was one of the first such accessories designed for Android and iOS users alike.</p><p>Now, ESR has released a similar <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-charging-pads">wireless charger</a> with the magnetic Qi2 specification onboard. This time, it's a positively tiny charging pad with a built-in USB-C cable. The ESR HaloLock Qi2 Mini Wireless Charger comes in black and white and usually retails for $19.99, but you can grab it on sale for just $16.99 or less pretty often.</p>

<h2 id="all-the-right-specs-2">All the right specs</h2>

<p>ESR's HaloLock Qi2 Mini Wireless Charger has all the perfect specs you'd want from any wireless charging pad. It's ideal for a household that has Android and iOS devices that support wireless charging. Since Qi2 is based on MagSafe, you don't have to worry about cross-platform support of this feature either.</p><p>The built-in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-cables-adapters">USB Type-C cable</a> is of the nylon braided variety. Mearing a lengthy 5-foot long, it's a super-durable cable that's going to withstand the test of time. Nylon-braided cables snag less, and they are less likely to break even if you have bets nibbling on them.</p><p>In fact, ESR guarantees up to 6,000 bends unbroken as per their testing.</p>

<p>This is the "mini" version of ESR's regular HaloLock Wireless Charger, which explains why it's so pocket-friendly by design. ESR HaloLock Qi2 Mini Wireless Charger hardly weighs anything and fits anywhere with ease.</p><p>You get Qi2 15W wireless charging speed on the ESR HaloLock Qi2 Mini Wireless Charger, making it suitable for phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Samsung Galaxy S25</a>.</p><p>The magnets are reinforced to be even stronger than ESR's other magnetic accessories, promising 1,200g of magnetic strength. Magnetism allows the little pad to snap on and off in a jiffy.</p><p>The little clip-shaped kickstand on the back makes full use of this magnetic power. It's like having a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phones">MagSafe stand for your phone</a> latch on and off whenever you need it, so you can continue binge-watching your favorite YouTuber or Netflix shows as your device charges wirelessly and stays propped up.</p>
<hr>
<p>Between all the cheap wireless chargers available on Amazon, Best Buy, and other retailers, it can be intimidating to settle on a single one. You don't really need anything more powerful than this 15W Qi2 charging pad.</p><p>Not to mention, the price is a big draw here too. The ESR HaloLock Qi2 Mini Wireless Charger is always going on sale too, sweetening the deal further.</p><p>If you're on the hunt for an affordable wireless charger that performs satisfactorily with both Android and iOS ecosystems, this is the perfect thing to buy.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Vivo's X200 Ultra drops April 21, and it’s bringing the big guns in camera department.</li><li>It’s loaded with a wild 200MP periscope lens and a 200mm super-zoom.</li><li>Up front is a 2K Zeiss display with eye-friendly tech, and rumors point to a roomy 6.82 inches.</li><li>Vivo is also rolling out the X200s, Pad 5 Pro, Pad SE, and Watch 5.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Vivo has confirmed that it is launching the X200 Ultra on April 21. As expected, the company's big 2025 flagship is built to impress, packing some serious photo firepower, including a wild 200MP periscope telephoto lens and an extra 200mm super-zoom to back it up.</p><p>Vivo announced on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/1809745371/Pm7tXsT57" target="_blank">Weibo</a> that it is bringing a whole lineup of new devices, including the X200s, X200 Ultra, Pad 5 Pro, Pad SE, and the new Watch 5 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Official-Vivo-X200-Ultra-launch-date-confirmed-alongside-first-press-photo.994298.0.html" target="_blank">Notebookcheck</a>). These new launches will join the Vivo X200 squad from last October, which already includes the X200, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">X200 Pro</a>, and the compact Pro Mini.</p><p>Just like the rumors said, the X200 Ultra is packing Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite chip. On top of that, Vivo is throwing in its own custom VS1 and V3+ chips to handle all the behind-the-scenes magic for photos and videos.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:529px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.20%;"><img id="MAvXTb6VBLRwtk5qHFf3Gf" name="Vivo-X200-Ultra-camera" alt="Vivo X200 Ultra camera bump" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MAvXTb6VBLRwtk5qHFf3Gf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="529" height="292" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Vivo / Weibo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<h2 id="screen-game-strong-2">Screen game strong</h2>
<p>Up front, the X200 Ultra sports a 2K Zeiss Master Color display with circular polarized light tech. Vivo says it’s built to be easier on the eyes, especially for long screen time. The brand hasn't spilled the exact screen size yet, but rumor has it we’re looking at a 6.82-inch panel.</p><p>The Vivo X200 Ultra is packing the same 200MP Samsung HP9 periscope cam from the X100 Ultra, but this time with a wider aperture for better low-light shots. It’s also geared up for crisp 4K video at 120fps, thanks to a duo of dedicated imaging chips doing the heavy lifting behind the scenes.</p>
<h2 id="that-thicc-camera-bump-2">That thicc camera bump</h2>
<p>A recently leaked hands-on video gave us an early peek at the Vivo X200 Ultra, and the camera bump absolutely dwarfs the modest module on the X200s.</p><p>Apparently, Vivo is cramming in two big 1/1.28-inch sensors for the 35mm main and 14mm ultrawide lenses, plus a telephoto lens with next-level low-light skills that’s pushing the limits of what <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-camera">camera smartphones</a> can do.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5145127924796589" target="_blank">separate leak</a>, tipster Digital Chat Station dropped some fresh X200 Ultra details on Weibo, including the expected color options. Vivo’s upcoming flagship is said to come in black, bold vine red, and white colorways.</p><p>Vivo itself teased a silver version of the X200 Ultra, showing off a back design with subtle vertical stripes for a bit of extra flair.</p>

The latest delay has to do with a bug that prevented Galaxy S24 users from unlocking their phones. While it looks like the issue was predominantly affecting units in Samsung's home market, the manufacturer paused the global rollout just to be on the safe side. <br><br>It's frustrating that Samsung is continuing to run into issues on the stable One UI 7 build, considering the brand ran a lengthy four-month beta testing program that was meant to iron out these problems. I understand the need to be cautious with these things — particularly if it affects something as basic as unlocking a phone — but Samsung should have done a better job addressing these issues well before it got to the stable release. <br><br>I reached out to Samsung for a statement regarding the delay, and the brand noted that the "rollout schedule is being updated to ensure the best possible experience." In typical Samsung fashion, it didn't answer what caused the delay, when the update might start going out to phones again, and what it is doing to prevent any additional roadblocks.</p>

<p>Thankfully, there are no issues on devices where One UI 7 comes pre-installed. The Galaxy S25, S25+, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">S25 Ultra</a>, and A56 debuted with the Android 15-based build, and having used the software on the A56 extensively, I didn't run into any bugs or crashes. It's clear that all the lingering issues have to do with upgrading phones running One UI 6 and older to the latest iteration of the software. <br><br>As to why that's the case, Samsung made considerable changes to One UI 7; as I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review">outlined in my review</a>, the update is packed with new features, including a cleaner visual design, vertical app drawer, split notification pane, overhauled camera interface, better image and video editing features, changes to battery management, security updates, and a suite of new AI additions. <br><br>While Samsung used a point release last year to integrate some of these changes — debuting One UI 6.1.1 down the line — it is bundling all the new features into a single release with One UI 7, and that may have also contributed to the extended beta testing program and incessant delays with the stable rollout.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="udemdt54kCKAfAbBPVCra6" name="Samsung One UI 7" alt="Samsung One UI 7 interface on Galaxy A56" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/udemdt54kCKAfAbBPVCra6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung wouldn't confirm when it would resume rolling out One UI 7 to Galaxy S24 devices globally, nor would it say when users in India might receive the update. While the update started going out to phones in South Korea, U.S., U.K., and select western markets, Samsung India didn't even announce plans to deliver One UI 7 to customers using its flagships in the country yet. <br><br>In a similar vein, there's no telling when Samsung's older mid-range phones might get the update — with global Galaxy S24 units and Z Fold 6 yet to make the switch, it will be a considerable wait before Samsung's 2024 and older devices make the move to One UI 7. While I like the update as such, the constant delays and bugs is reminiscent of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oxygenos-12-oneplus-identity">OxygenOS 12 debacle</a> — albeit with greater consequences.</p>

<ul><li>Google's last official security patch for Android 12 and Android 12L was the March 2025 update.</li><li>As of March 31, 2025, Google is no longer supporting the Android 12 and 12L operating systems.</li><li>OEMs can still choose to manually backport security releases to their devices; alternatively, users can switch to a custom ROM.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-12">Android 12</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-12l-availability">Android 12L</a> have officially reached end-of-life status, and won't receive any more updates or security patches from Google. The last official security update for Android 12 and 12L was the March 2025 release, as devices running these operating systems did not receive the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-april-security-update-screen-flicker-camera-fixes">latest April 2025 security patch</a>. Now, the company has confirmed that this isn't a fluke, officially ending support for Android 12 and 12L as of March 31, 2025 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-12-end-of-life-3544499/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>).</p><p>Google supports Android operating systems for many years after they have been replaced. Typically, there is a large percentage of devices still running older operating systems, sometimes because they can't be upgraded. In this instance, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gs.statcounter.com/android-version-market-share" target="_blank">Statcounter</a> estimates that over 12% of Android devices worldwide are still running either Android 12 or 12L.</p><p>These devices have been receiving the latest patches from the Android Security Bulletin through security patch backports for years, but that support window has now come to an end. This is typical for Google support, as it maintained current security patches for more than three years after Android 12 and 12L officially rolled out.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="ShS4cFPGvm8NNeYxW4MFbL" name="android-12-hero-logo-pixel-5-4a-5g.jpg" alt="Android 12 Logo + Pixel phones" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ShS4cFPGvm8NNeYxW4MFbL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1536" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Alex Dobie / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Regardless, support for Android 12 and 12L ending means that older Android phones will almost certainly be stuck on older security patches, without the latest fixes. The list of phones no longer supported now includes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s10-review">Samsung Galaxy S10 series</a>, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-3a-review">Google Pixel 3a series</a>, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-7-review">OnePlus 7 series</a>.</p><p>OEMs still have the option of manually backporting security patches on the Android Security Bulletin to their devices, but it remains to be seen if any will do so.</p><p>Without the latest security patches, Android 12 and 12L devices immediately become security risks. To keep these devices in use, users will need to find a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/lineageos-22-1-based-on-android-15-is-already-available-for-over-100-devices">custom Android ROM capable of receiving the latest patches</a>.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google will soon bring Gemini support to Wear OS watches, replacing the current Google Assistant. But so far, it's hard to say if Gemini will bring substantial new features or just add a fresh coat of paint to the same Assistant tricks.</p><p>In March, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-assistant/google-assistant-becomes-gemini">announced its full transition to Gemini</a>: After replacing Assistant on Android phones, it would bring <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> to tablets, Android Auto, headphones, Nest speakers, Google TV, and (of course) smartwatches, with more details in the "next few months."</p><p>Now, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/04/14/gemini-wear-os-update/">9to5Google</a> has decompiled Google APKs in version 1.18.x of the Assistant app, revealing how Gemini will work compared to Assistant. So far, it looks like a "straightforward app update" rather than a substantial change.</p><p>The site found code strings with the text "Gemini is now on your watch" and "Get started with Gemini: Speak naturally and get more done with a personal AI assistant on your watch."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="6DFxd4FoARrheoJkr39VzZ" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-3-assistant-response-gemini" alt="A Google Assistant response describing Gemini according to Wikipedia." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6DFxd4FoARrheoJkr39VzZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">It'll be hard to fit these in-depth Gemini answers on a 1.3-inch display! </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Pulling up Gemini will be the same as using Assistant; you'll either use the "Hey Google" wake word or hold down the side button, then use your Wi-Fi connection to send your questions Google's way.</p><p>Likewise, 9to5Google's Abner Li reports that At a Glance, Location and Match Voice settings, and pinned actions in the Wear OS tile are all unchanged with Gemini on Wear OS.</p><p>Gemini will “do things like set alarms and timers, message your contacts, and more,” which are all current Assistant functions.</p><p>There <em>is</em> a new "Gemini can make mistakes" disclaimer, something you typically see when using Gemini on your Android phone. While Assistant usually responds to questions with "According to X" or featured snippets from Google Search, Gemini on Wear OS should use LLM-generated responses.</p><p>It'll be interesting to see if Gemini for Wear OS tries to make its LLM responses more concise to better fit on small displays or stay long-winded for the sake of accuracy and usefulness.

<ul><li>Android 15 now requires 32GB of onboard storage, enforcing this requirement by leveraging GMS licensing.</li><li>Technically, phones with less than 32GB of storage can still run AOSP builds of Android 15.</li><li>Phones with 3GB of memory or fewer are now required to use Android Go Edition.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Android's base-level system requirements are quite low compared to the premium capabilities of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best phones</a> on the market. However, they do increase from time to time, and Android 15 includes new storage and tweaked RAM requirements for devices. As discovered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-minimum-storage-requirement-3543169/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, Google now requires devices to ship with 32GB of storage to run (or upgrade to) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>.</p><p>The increased requirement has to do with increasing sizes of Android OS updates, as well as individual app sizes. By the time you install Android on a phone with 16GB of RAM and download a few apps, you're out of storage. As such, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> is the last version that can run on low-end devices with only 16GB of storage. While uncommon, Android phones with 16GB of storage do exist, particularly on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">ultra-budget phones with expandable storage</a>.</p><p>As always, the new 32GB requirement must have 75% of its total capacity allocated to the main Android data partition, which includes the OS itself plus apps and files. Technically, budget Android phones can run Android 15 with less than 32GB of storage using the Android Open Source Project (AOSP).</p><p>With that being said, critical Google services — like GMS — can be withheld from devices that don't comply with these requirements, severely impacting usability. For instance, a Google Mobile Services license is required to offer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play-services">Google Play Services</a>, and crucially, the Google Play Store for apps.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="zkdoggnQWXa33EDViG7YSK" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review-4" alt="Android 15 logo on the Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zkdoggnQWXa33EDViG7YSK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The 32GB requirement for Android 15 is up from 16GB for Android 14. It's the first time Google has raised Android system requirements since Android 13, which was the first to require 16GB. Before that, Android 12 only needed 8GB to run. All of these versions necessitated that 75% of the capacity be allocated to the main data partition.</p><p>Aside from the new storage requirements, Vulkan 1.3 graphics is required for chipsets running Android 15. The same goes for ANGLE libraries, unless the device is using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-go">Android Go Edition</a> — a version of Android specifically optimized for lower-end hardware. This comes as Google recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16s-vulkan-standard-is-great-but-adpf-might-be-the-real-miracle">made Vulkan the official graphics API for Android</a>.</p><p>The changes also require devices with 3GB of memory or less to use Android Go Edition, up from 2GB. The baseline requirement of 2GB memory for GMS licensing is unchanged.</p><p>Starting with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a>, ANGLE libraries must be enabled by default on devices. It's unclear whether the next version of Android will include any other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/when-will-my-phone-get-android-16">new hardware requirements</a>.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Legendary director James Cameron had a transformative, heavenly experience when he put on a Quest headset to watch VR films. And based on behind-the-scenes demos with unreleased Meta Quest headsets that he "can't talk about," he thinks things will get even more exciting in the "next few years."</p><p>The question is whether the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-4">Meta Quest 4</a> can truly become the next home for Hollywood directors, as Cameron hopes.</p><p>On the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/qOdjM14QW0s">Boz to the Future podcast</a>, Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth interviewed Cameron, whose company, Lightstorm Vision, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/blog/james-cameron-lightstorm-vision-partnership/">partnered with Meta</a> to make "world-class 3D entertainment experiences spanning live sports and concerts, feature films, and TV series featuring big-name IP on Meta Quest."</p><p>The episode ranges from the benefits of AI for VFX to a technical history of filmmaking, but Cameron also spoke at length about why VR is the definitive way to experience his films — and tried to talk about mysterious future Quests before Boz stopped him.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qOdjM14QW0s?start=1395" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>"Brightness is a big deal in theaters," Cameron explains, but he finds it "heartbreaking" that "99% of theaters" don't capture the calibrated color and dynamic range that he wants, so his films look "dim and dull."</p><p>But with a Quest 3 or any other XR headset, because they create a "discrete left-eye right-eye image," you immediately get a brighter, curated experience. The headset's subjective scale and FoV lets you "feel like you're in a theater," but without the downsides.</p><p>"A door opened for me," Cameron said about his first next-gen headset experience. "It was like the heavens parted, light shone down. There was an angel choir singing. It's like, 'ah'! This is how people can see the movie the way I created it to be seen!"</p>

<p>Cameron said he was looking at "some Avatar 3 material" on a headset that morning, and thought, "Wow, this looks great. This looks at least as good as Dolby Laser Vision Cinema, which is the <em>ne plus ultra</em> in an actual group theater."</p><p>At the end of the talk, Cameron discussed how big streamers like Netflix spent huge money on big filmmakers, then refused to greenlight their films to focus on uncreative procedural shows. So he hopes that the "HMD world" will attract filmmakers away from streaming platforms.</p><p>3D VR filmmaking could "blow open over the next few years with some of the new devices you've shared with me," Cameron told Bosworth. He asked if he could "talk about" these mystery Quest prototypes, but when Boz shut that down, Cameron simply said, "It's going to be very f***ing cool."</p><p>"We hope to build a bigger audience that reinvigorates people's willingness to invest" in VR filmmaking, Bosworth responded.</p><p>The filmmaker concluded the podcast by suggesting listeners "follow Meta for the next couple years," and that everything (aside from Avatar 3) that Cameron is doing is related to Meta because "I'm a 3D guy and [Meta is] the best channel."</p>

<p>In the early days of the VR renaissance, the Tribeca Film Festival had a Virtual Arcade where Hollywood filmmakers streamed 3D films on Oculus Rifts. I attended every year, interviewing Hollywood producers about why VR filmmaking had so much untapped potential compared to traditional films.</p><p>I saw <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.wareable.com/vr/here-be-dragons-tribeca-the-protectors-7776">Hillary Clinton speak to Kathryn Bigelow</a> about her VR anti-poaching documentary, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.wareable.com/vr/bourne-identity-director-takes-on-vr-with-new-film-invisible">spoke to Bourne director Doug Liman</a> about his VR TV series, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.wareable.com/vr/best-vr-films-games-tribeca-film-festival-2018">spoke to Her Story creator Sam Barlow</a> about merging games and films through the VR medium. It was an exciting time, when VR films and games felt equally important.</p><p>While VR filmmaking still exists, the interest (and funding) has faded. Big brands like Google and Oculus (later Meta) shut down their in-house studios, and most directors left VR behind as a fad while Quest primarily became a space for gaming and fitness.</p><p>There's a reason why Boz said they need to "reinvigorate people's willingness to invest" in VR films. They're still made today, but they're often niche, free tie-in experiences for other content — not a space for long-form content where you can earn your money back.</p>

<p>Today, you can watch 3D movies on Apple Vision Pro — like Cameron's Avatar — but there's a difference between an extra dimension on 2D films and films shot with 180º or 360º cameras that immerse you in a space and let you choose where to look.</p><p>I suspect Cameron's Meta work will also focus more on stereoscopic 3D content rather than spatial content, but I'm happy to be proven wrong. If you haven't watched true VR films before, believe me when I say that the most powerful ones will stay in your brain years later, as well as you might remember going somewhere in real life.</p><p>But will other Hollywood directors follow suit? It all depends on whether or not the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-4">Quest 4</a> really is so "f***ing cool" that it becomes more popular for streaming, not just gaming.</p>

<p>At GDC 2025, Meta's head of game publishing Chris Pruett talked about how Meta's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/gdc-2025-oculus-publishing-head-challenges-meta-criticism-on-quest-store-profitability">target audience has shifted</a> from elite gamers to teens who love meme games like Gorilla Tag. But they now believe that "mainstream adults," or "30-something dads," will be the next "major player" on Quest headsets in 2026 and 2027.</p><p>To target this demographic, they want to make the next Quest headset a "really high-end TV" for non-gamers to use as a TV replacement. So I suspected at the time that the Quest 4 would get a major resolution boost, closer to what the Apple Vision Pro offers.</p><p><em>This</em> is probably what Cameron wanted to talk about. Meta let him try a future headset prototype with good-enough resolution for high-res, 3D films, and Cameron wants to port his next 3D films a few inches from your eyes with the brightness and clarity that you don't always get in a theater.</p><p>And this explains why Meta wants to invest in this partnership now. Making films and TV shows takes time, especially 3D ones! If it wants to have content for the Quest 4 in a couple of years, it makes sense that they'd start now.</p><p>I don't know if Cameron will be able to convince any of his Hollywood peers to jump on the VR train. But his presence alone has me excited for what kind of immersive 3D films we'll see on Quest headsets in the future.</p>

<p><em><strong>Sarah asks:</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>I just bought a new Samsung and it already has apps for mail, calendar, contacts, and other things installed. Is it OK to use these or should I install Google's versions from the app store? </strong></em></p>
<p>Hi Sarah! Congrats on the new phone. It's always fun using one once the setting-up part is over, and it sounds like you're going through that part right now. I think this is the very worst part of buying a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">new Android phone</a>, and having a bunch of apps preinstalled is part of the reason why. Phone makers really need to "borrow" Apple's way of making a full backup, which you can restore if you want to.</p><p>Anyhoo, the quick answer to your question is that it's perfectly fine to use the apps that are already there, though some of them <em>might</em> be worth changing. Let's dive a little deeper to learn why I think this way.</p>
<h2 id="the-best-apps-2">The "best" apps</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4004px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="i7E3q4FJcfqW2HYVLwYG4S" name="Google-Messages-Voice-Message-Transcript.jpg" alt="A Voice Message Transcript on Google Messages" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/i7E3q4FJcfqW2HYVLwYG4S.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4004" height="2252" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The first thing to know is that companies like Samsung use tools built into Android to connect apps to your Google account, the same as Google's various app development teams do. Apps like contacts or calendar tie into Google's cloud, where everything is stored, and they connect automatically once you've set them up.</p><p>The real differences are in the UI (user interface). Some companies add a bit of extra flourish to the look with colors or icons, and you might even find different features between different companies' apps. And that can make a big difference.</p><p>It's also worth noting that some of those apps are actually from Google because they <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-gms-and-why-does-my-phone-need-it">must be pre-installed on every "official" Android-powered phone</a>. Apps like Photos or Chrome are from Google, no matter which company made your phone.</p>
<p>With all that said, there are three apps from Google you should install or keep installed:</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-google-chrome-tips-and-tricks"><strong>Google Chrome</strong></a> is not the best browser for your Android phone but there are times when you need to use it because so many websites on the internet are specifically made to run best in Chrome. Other browsers share the same base as Chrome (called Chromium), be still, stuff gets broken sometimes.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-messages-will-soon-use-color-to-differentiate-rcs-and-sms-mms-users"><strong>Google Messages</strong></a> may not have all the features you'll find in a messaging app from another company, but it gets updates to Android's messaging platform as soon as they are ready. I would suggest you use this for text messaging with people who aren't using something like WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-is-letting-you-chat-with-your-pictures-thanks-to-gemini"><strong>Google Photos</strong></a> is a must-have for everyone with an Android phone. The interface is kind of confusing and goofy, but keeping a cloud backup of everything you thought was important enough to take a picture of is awesome. Make sure you set it up to do it, even if you use a different app to look at things on your phone itself.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-gains-more-google-assistant-features"><strong>Google Gemini/Assistant</strong></a> is simply better than anything from the company that made your phone, no matter which company that is. If you want to use AI stuff, take the time to get it set up.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6016px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="y8WW6c4nL6HjxMyYbqix43" name="Samsung-Internet-hero.jpg" alt="Samsung Internet welcome screen on mobile" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y8WW6c4nL6HjxMyYbqix43.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6016" height="3384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are some other apps that you might want to use that don't come from Google, too. Some don't really matter; use whichever contacts and calendar app you like, for example, because they all do the same thing, even though they may look and feel a little different.</p><p><strong>Use another internet browser</strong>. You mentioned you bought a Samsung, so using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-internet-browser-app-update-to-bring-gestures">Samsung's web browser</a> is a fine idea. You get the benefit of extensions, a better UI, and more features and tools. You still have Chrome to fall back on if things seem like they are broken, but a third-party browser can offer a much better experience most of the time.</p><p><strong>Use another messenger if you can</strong>. I suggest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whatsapp">WhatsApp</a> because it's so popular. There isn't anything wrong with Google Messages, but it's still tied to your phone service, and other apps are much more popular, especially outside of North America. Find out which one most of your friends and family are using and install it.</p><p><strong>Use any file browser not made by Google</strong>. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/files-by-google-smart-search-features">Google's all suck</a>, there's no gentle way to say it. Some are more advanced than others, but I find Samsung's to be fine, and it should already be installed.</p><p><strong>Spotify/Apple Music/Tidal</strong> or another online music service might be worth looking into. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music-bad-product-desperate-need-improvement">YouTube Music</a> works fine, but the UI is a mess, and the discovery feeds are garbage sometimes.</p>
<p>You'll see lots of recommendations from other folks online, and it's often worth checking them out. Some are for more advanced users, like manual camera apps, while others offer a great experience for casual users. Most of them are free, so check the permissions, install them, and give them a go — you can always uninstall them later.</p><p>Half the fun of having a smartphone is finding cool new things you can do with it, so never be afraid to experiment!</p>

<hr>
<p>Following Google's recent AI test, the company is reportedly working on an improved Search bar to help users get involved.</p><p>Found in the main Google app by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/04/14/google-ai-mode-search-bar/">9to5Google</a>, the company is seemingly working on bringing a dedicated AI Mode button within the Search bar. The button (a magnifying glass) will be encased in a ring of Google's classic assortment of colors. This option is held completely separate from the app's primary Search function, the bar itself.</p><p>Tapping the icon produces a separate menu from the Search bar. Typially, users are taken to a list of "trending searches" on Google, as well as the ability to search what they want. However, for AI Mode, users tapping this new button will receive a short sub-menu with the feature's writing field.</p><p>Inside the field, at the bottom, users will find options to attach an image or to take a photo.</p><p>The company is also giving users a look at a few suggested actions that it can provide insight for. Due to AI Mode's entrance in the Search bar, the publication notes that the Lens and voice icons have disappeared. Google has seemingly placed them beneath the Search bar, which means the other buttons for the Translator and more have been moved elsewhere.</p>

<p>Nothing is for sure with this slight change, as it seems Google is testing this new location. It's also not quite as widespread.</p><p>Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-tests-experimental-ai-mode">AI Mode</a> is a relatively new feature that debuted in early March. The feature is designed to feel like AI Overviews 2.0. At its core, the company stated AI Mode will seek to assist users with understanding "complex topics" by producing results that incorporate highly advanced reasoning and thinking. AI Mode is also said to deliver answers to more nuanced questions "in one go," rather than forcing users to dig through additional search results.</p><p>A short demonstration showed how AI Mode can answer a question briefly, giving appropriate links, while also going deeper with longer explanations.</p><p>The mode shortly arrived in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-searchs-ai-mode-is-now-giving-early-access-to-select-users">early access for select users</a> a couple of days after. Meanwhile, Google also announced that it would integrate Gemini into AI Mode, bringing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-assistant/googles-ai-mode-gets-geminis-multimodal-powers">multimodal capabilities</a> to this new feature. Simply put, Google said this upgrade will ensure AI Mode can deliver comprehensive answers to complex questions in one go.</p>

<ul><li>The OnePlus 13T has leaked yet again, this time revealing the rear design of the small flagship.</li><li>Unlike other OnePlus phones, the OnePlus 13T appears to have a squircle camera housing positioned asymmetrically.</li><li>The phone also supposedly has excellent 50/50 weight balance.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The OnePlus 13T, a smaller and more compact version of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a>, is set to arrive later this month. Official teasers and unofficial leaks are rolling in, with the latest one coming from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/PnbS6in4F" target="_blank">Digital Chat Station on Weibo</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/04/14/oneplus-13t-design-balance-leak/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). The reputable leaker shared an image of the OnePlus 13T with a back design that's a departure from the rest of the OnePlus 13 series.</p><p>OnePlus phones, for multiple generations, have sported a large circular rear camera housing centered on the back. With the OnePlus 13T, that's changing. The "mini" phone appears to feature a squircle camera bump on the back with two camera lenses and a flash. It looks most similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold's</a> rear camera bump, which is also a squircle positioned near the topmost left corner.</p><p>The leaked image appears to show a matte finish in a black or space gray-esque colorway. It's officially called "Cloud Ink Black," per Digital Chat Station. However, it's important to note that these finish names are translated to English, so the actual terms may vary. "Morning Mist Gray" and "Heartbeat Pink" are also tipped to be available as OnePlus 13T colorways.</p>

<p>The OnePlus 13T has been officially teased for weeks now, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-teases-its-upcoming-13t-as-a-part-of-an-april-fools-prank">a major reveal happening on April Fool's Day</a>. It is set to launch later this month, according to leaks, but availability and pricing is unclear. With the ongoing tariff situation in the U.S., which shockingly drove up the price of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch/oneplus-watch-3-releases-with-a-hefty-price-tag-in-the-us-and-we-dont-know-why">OnePlus Watch 3</a>, there's more uncertainty than usual.</p>

<p>Although the latest render from Digital Chat Station doesn't show off the full design of the phone, other leaks are filling the gap.

<ul><li><em><strong>See our guide to the </strong></em><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-google-pixel-9a-deals-of-the-month"><em><strong>best Google Pixel 9a deals</strong></em></a><em><strong> on the web today</strong></em></li></ul>
<p>After being delayed for a few weeks because of a "component quality issue", the Google Pixel 9a was finally released on April 10th with considerably less fanfare than you'd expect from a mainstream device launch. Still, the rollout may have been disappointing, but the device itself is not, coming complete with an outstanding 5,100mAh battery (larger than the regular Pixel 9), Tensor G4 chipset, and vivid 6.3-inch pOLED display. Pair those specs with all the latest Gemini AI features and seven years of software updates and you're looking at a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">cheap Android phone</a> that punches well above its weight. </p><p>Unlike some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-verizon-phone-deals-plans">Verizon deals</a>, this offer is compelling because it doesn't require a trade-in, nor does it force you to sign up for the most expensive data plans to receive the savings. Unlimited Welcome, for instance, is one of Verizon's most affordable options, giving users unlimited talk, text, and data on the carrier's vast 5G network. The plan starts at $65 per month for a single line, but you can drop the price considerably when you add multiple lines (as low as $30 per month for four lines). </p><p>Sure, if you're looking for a trade-in deal or prefer to buy phones unlocked, by all means look elsewhere.

<ul><li>Rumors of an "early preview" for Samsung's One UI 8 have surfaced, alleging some changes users may see.</li><li>The first involves the potential expansion of One UI 7's Now Brief to older devices, like Samsung's 2024 foldables.</li><li>Other changes involved slight design tweaks to the Gallery and Files Manager apps.</li><li>Rumors claim Samsung has already entered "deep testing" for One UI 8 on the Galaxy S25 as the company tries to keep pace with Google's early Android 16.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Early interest for Samsung's next One UI version mounts as leaks purport feature expansions and redesigns.</p><p>X tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/tarunvats33/status/1911737881703358968">Tarun Vats</a> highlighted a few alleged One UI 8 leaks discovered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/samsung-one-ui-8-first-look-android-16-foundation-with-familiar-design-exclusive/">SmartPrix</a>. The publication's supposed "early preview" brought word that One UI 7's Now Brief will "no longer be a Galaxy S25 exclusive," per Vats on X. The post states the "current build" for One UI 8 contains this feature, and it's apparent availability for other "high-end models," like the Galaxy Z Flip 6, Fold 6, and more.</p><p>The snapshots suggest Now Brief will continue to incorporate a range of Samsung's apps for personalized suggestions. The leaked photo shows apps like Smart Home, battery status, YouTube Shorts, and Digital Wellbeing, among others.</p>
<h2 id="slight-reworks-2">Slight Reworks</h2>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">One UI 8 - Gallery First look ‼️ pic.twitter.com/SzzEg8xXxR<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1911736868728693116">April 14, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Aside from a feature expansion, the publication's supposed hands-on suggests Samsung is working on a few "visual tweaks." For now, these changes were spotted in the Gallery and Files Manager apps. Regarding the former, the early build shows a blurred, transparent design for the Gallery's sub-menu. Additionally, the provided icons are no longer simple icons laid atop a gray background.</p><p>It seems Samsung will give these icons their own bubbles on the top row while giving pill-shaped icons to options like Shared Albums, Clean Out, Trash, and Settings.</p><p>The Files Manager is altering its main view. The post claims users could see its categories stacked in more rectangular boxes instead of square. Moreover, beneath that, Samsung's early test showed a slightly refined "recently added" section. The Files Manager may state how many files you've recently added in a simple carousel for your viewing pleasure.</p>

<p>Interestingly, this isn't the first time we've heard about the Now Brief potentially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/older-samsung-galaxy-phones-foldables-one-ui-7-now-brief-code-spotted">arriving for older phones and foldables</a>. A tipster discovered remnants of its code available in the One UI 7 beta code for the Galaxy S24, as well as code for the Flip 6 and Fold 6. While there's hope, we need to remember <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-ai-hardware-limitations-interview-highlight">Samsung's interview</a> with its EVP and head of Framework R&D, Sally, who said owners of past-gen devices shouldn't expect every One UI 7 feature.</p><p>Aside from that, rumors have claimed Samsung may jump from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-8-sooner-after-one-ui-7-rumors">One UI 7 right into One UI 8</a>, considering how much sooner Android 16 is arriving. Those speculations were seemingly bolstered as Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s25-caught-testing-samsungs-upcoming-one-ui-8-android-16-update">was supposedly caught</a> with a One UI 8 test build for the Galaxy S25. Evidence of this build was reportedly spotted on Samsung's internal servers for the latest smartphone.</p><p>Samsung itself <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung/samsung-beta-team-highlights-one-ui-8-testing-rumors">spoke about this topic</a> in March, saying users shouldn't get too excited. The company stated what users are hearing whispers about likely involve early test builds (which we've seen repeatedly) and only indicate the "early stages" of development. As of now, there's no clue when One UI 8 could arrive; however, Google is planning to rollout Android 16 in Q2 2025.</p>

<p>Netflix appears to be finding a few more ways to make its subscribers engaged with the streaming platform as it is going to incorporate a new search strategy, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com./news/articles/2025-04-11/netflix-tests-new-ai-search-engine-to-recommend-shows-movies">Bloomberg reports</a>.</p><p>The streaming giant is currently testing an OpenAI-powered search engine to help users find TV shows and movies by using specific terms, notes Bloomberg. It can also include terms based on the user's current mood, for which they can get recommendations with the use of new search technology.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="N2asewEyu7LkDZ4ieyMZsf" name="Netflix-close-up-TV-logo.jpeg" alt="Netflix app on TV" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N2asewEyu7LkDZ4ieyMZsf.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For some iOS devices for users in Australia and New Zealand, the tool is said to be already live for testing, and it is likely to expand to even more markets, including the U.S. “It’s early days for the feature and we’re really in a learn and listen phase for this beta,” Netflix spokesperson MoMo Zhou recently confirmed to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/647518/netflix-openai-search-beta-test-ios">The Verge</a>.</p><p>Currently, Netflix allows users to search by genres, actors' names, year, and the streaming platform has been using AI and machine learning for its recommendations that users already see, which is based on users' watch history and liked content. The new tech appears to be a step up as it adds an extra and more precise layer to already existing search and could give consumers a lot more options on what they want to watch.</p>
<p>Netflix has been on the verge of adding new features for its subscribers for quite some time now. For instance, recently, the platform has added live programming and games, which included the fight between Jake Paul and Mike Tyson, and NFL games during the 2024 Christmas too. The company is expected to add even more this year.</p><p>In other Netflix news early this year, the streaming giant <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/netflix-q4-2024-record-revenue-price-hike-report">noted</a> that its Q4, 2024 report has outperformed the previous quarter with the revenue growing by 16% YoY (year over year), the operating income rising by 52% YoY, and by the end of 2024, the company settled with 302 million subscribers.</p>

Why do I think this? Well, let's break it down.</p><p>Here at Android Central, we're constantly gathering all of the most reputable rumors and insider leaks to determine when and if a new device is going to drop, and we have a pretty outstanding track record (if I may say so myself).</p><p>There's also a bit of common sense involved in this case, as Samsung typically hosts two announcement events each year: one in winter and one during the summer months. In other words, if past years are any indication, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> will arrive in July or August.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="LnM5qCzbhvm9LQNgLsJdBe" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-15.jpg" alt="Back of Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 in-hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LnM5qCzbhvm9LQNgLsJdBe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While nothing is confirmed just yet, months of <strong>rumors and leaks have suggested that we'll get a first look at the Galaxy Z Fold 7 during a Samsung Unpacked event this July</strong>. Similar to past years, we expect the premium foldable phone to be unveiled alongside the clamshell-style Galaxy Z Flip 7 and — most likely — the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Fold 7 will be following last year's Galaxy Z Fold 6, a powerful yet somewhat underwhelming device that bore a steep starting price of $1,899.99. It's quite likely that the 2025 version of the phone will boast a similar price tag, but early signs suggest that we may enjoy some meaningful upgrades to make up for the investment.</p><p>For example, the new foldable phone is expected to feature the same incredible Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset that powers the Galaxy S25 series, plus we're almost certain to get that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-may-finally-bring-this-much-needed-upgrade-to-the-galaxy-z-fold-7">"creaseless" display showcased during MWC 2025</a>. That's pretty much the ultimate goal for producers of foldable phones, and if Samsung finally pulls it off, it's a big deal.</p><p>Still, a phone that costs nearly $2,000 feels a little out-of-touch in this day and age, and the steep price tags continue to be the biggest barrier to entry for most folks interested in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a>. Fortunately, Samsung is sure to offer some preorder discounts that will soften the blow once the phone is unveiled.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-faq"><span>FAQ</span></h3>
<h2 id="when-will-the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-launch-2">When will the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 launch?</h2>
<p>The Galaxy Z Fold 7 is expected to be announced at a Samsung Unpacked event in July or August. After the initial reveal, it usually takes a couple of weeks before the phone actually hits store shelves. For example, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 was announced on July 10th, 2024, and released on July 24th, while the Z Fold 5 was announced on July 26th, 2023, with an August 11th street date.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="55ZQmVwWJDrUhztCxVy7Vo" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-7.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 on cobblestone road" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/55ZQmVwWJDrUhztCxVy7Vo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<h2 id="how-much-will-the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-cost-2">How much will the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 cost?</h2>
<p>Samsung's Z Fold series is notoriously expensive. 2024's Z Fold 6, for instance, hit store shelves with a whopping starting price of $1,899 for the 256GB version, while the 1TB configuration maxed out at a steep $2,259.</p><p>If I had to guess, I'd expect that the Z Fold 7 will have a starting price of <em>at least</em> $1,899, but the rumored spec boost — which includes upgrades like the Snapdragon 8 Elite and a new creaseless display panel — might raise the price even further. That being said, you never know: the Galaxy S25 series was revealed just a few months ago with the same price tags as its predecessor, which was honestly refreshing for such a high-profile flagship.</p><p>Needless to say, the announcement of the device is sure to be accompanied by a ton of preorder deals, so that should help lessen the blow.</p>
<h2 id="will-the-galaxy-z-fold-6-drop-in-price-2">Will the Galaxy Z Fold 6 drop in price?</h2>
<p>Now that the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is (probably) just around the corner, many Android fans are wondering if it's a good time to buy last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>. While it's hard to know for sure, I can say that the Z Fold 6 has been receiving some pretty impressive discounts over the past few months, dropping to as low as $1,119.99 during major sale events. The problem is that Z Fold 6 stock is sure to diminish quickly once the new phone arrives, so playing the waiting game can be a bit risky.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="U7ci7G9gqtLnMu6gFp796X" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-18.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 with fountain behind" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U7ci7G9gqtLnMu6gFp796X.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Galaxy Z Fold 5 from 2023, for instance, is almost impossible to find new and unlocked at retailers like Amazon today, and the one third-party seller that has the phone in stock as of writing is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Unlocked-Android-Smartphone-Streaming/dp/B0C63H2MDL/"><strong>trying to ditch it for over $1,300.</strong></a> In other words, if you prefer unlocked phones, don't feel like you need to wait for the Z Fold 7 to buy its predecessor.</p><p><strong>What I </strong><em><strong>would </strong></em><strong>do, however, is plan to buy the Galaxy Z Fold 6 during a major sale event, such as Prime Day</strong>. That Amazon sale is likely to come just a week or two before Samsung Unpacked, and it might present the perfect opportunity to purchase the Z Fold 6 before its new sibling arrives.</p><p>Furthermore, if you're able to process a trade-in or upgrade your wireless service, you may want to wait and see what Z Fold 7 preorder deals go live once the phone gets announced. Knowing how Samsung handles its newest devices, I wouldn't be surprised if these early offers put the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-deals">best Galaxy Z Fold 6 deals</a> to shame.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung users' happiness knew no bounds as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/stable-one-ui-7-rolls-out-to-users-both-in-the-us-and-european-regions">One UI 7 finally started </a>rolling out last week. But this feeling was very short-lived. The Korean OEM seems to have stalled the rollout of its stable One UI 7, which became available to people in the U.S. only four days ago.</p><p>According to a new leak that surfaced on Sunday (April 13), avid Tipster IceUniverse took to X (prev. Twitter) to give their followers some bad news. In the post, they stated that after the firmware was pushed in Korea on April 10, the company seemed to have identified a "serious bug," which led to the company suspending One UI 7's rollout globally.</p><p>IceUniverse also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1911651452713648568">stated</a> that the bug is causing some Korean Galaxy S24 users to see issues with unlocking their devices once they updated to the new firmware.</p><p>Looks like the One UI 7 Saga continues, this is the first time that Samsung delayed the rollout of its firmware and after pushing out several Beta versions and testing it out for months on end, the firmware finally reached devices in Korea on April 7, and Samsung jotted down a global roll-out program that reached other countries by the end of May.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sudden!After the Korean Galaxy S24 series firmware was pushed, a serious bug was found, which led to the suspension of the push plan in all other countries, including China.<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1911616077756580142">April 14, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>The first ones to see this software update pop up on their phones are those with either the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24 </a>series or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung/one-ui-7-finally-gives-the-galaxy-z-fold-6-a-taste-of-that-pixel-fold-trick">Galaxy Z Fold 6 </a>and<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-hands-on"> Z Flip 6,</a> much like how the rollout happened in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/samsung-finally-starts-rolling-out-stable-one-ui-7-for-galaxy-s24-series">Korea</a>.</p><p>But now, according to another tipster TarunVats, the firmware build has been nowhere to be seen on OTA servers since this weekend. He also states that Samsung took down the One UI 7 update scheduled for Vietnam from its newsroom web app.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Galaxy Fam!!It's official—the worldwide One UI 7 rollout is paused.The Galaxy S24 series and Z Fold/Flip6 (now US models) have had their updates pulled.

<p>Samsung has yet to put out an official statement on the situation, however, as of now, we have no timeline as to when the One UI 7 will be available for download again. However, according to AC staff who have this build on their phones, they've experienced no issues whatsoever since the update last week. "New expandable widgets, new notification behavior, etc all seem to be fine," said AC's Jeremy Kaplan, who owns a Galaxy S24 Ultra.</p><p>Lastly, other devices that were set to see the One UI 7 build later this month and in May, might see a delay in rollout as well. This includes the Galaxy Z Fold 4/ Flip 4/ 3, Galaxy S23 series, S23 FE, A34, A35, S22/ S21 series, and the Tab S9/S8 series.</p><p>While we have no information on additional issues this bug could be causing, it seems like a major hiccup in the whole firmware rollout process. Android Central has reached out to Samsung about this and we will update this article once we have more information.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-52">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The Galaxy XCover 7 Pro is a beast with a Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 chip, IP68 water/dust resistance, MIL-STD-810H durability, and Gorilla Glass Victus+ for extra protection.</li><li>The Tab Active 5 Pro also packs the same Snapdragon chip, runs without an internal battery when docked, and lets you swap batteries without turning off.</li><li>Both rugged devices got some smarts, too, with Galaxy AI features like Circle to Search and Object Eraser, usually found in Samsung's flagships.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung today pulled the wraps off its latest rugged devices: the Galaxy XCover 7 Pro and Tab Active 5 Pro. Built with frontline teams and enterprise use in mind, these rugged devices keep the durability Samsung has been known for, but now with even more power to handle whatever the job throws their way.</p><p>The Galaxy XCover 7 Pro stands out with its tough build, boasting IP68 water and dust resistance, MIL-STD-810H military-grade durability, and Gorilla Glass Victus+ protecting the screen. It’s a solid upgrade over last year’s XCover 7 and officially takes the baton from the XCover 6 Pro that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-xcover-6-pro-announcement">dropped three years ago</a>.</p>
<h2 id="tough-meets-smart-2">Tough meets smart</h2>
<p>Aside from being tough, the XCover 7 Pro is also smart where it counts. Samsung threw in some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> tricks usually reserved for its flagships, like Google's Circle to Search and the Object Eraser.</p><p>The Galaxy XCover 7 Pro levels up with the Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 chip, giving it way more muscle than the regular XCover 7’s Dimensity 6100+. It even edges out the older XCover 6 Pro’s Snapdragon 778G.</p>

<p>It rocks a brighter 6.6-inch display and a 4,350mAh battery. But what really sets it apart is its customization options, going way beyond regular phones. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-rugged-android-phones">rugged phone</a> boasts customizable physical buttons and pogo pin connectors for extra accessories and charging.</p><p>The Galaxy XCover 7 Pro packs a bit more juice, bumping up from 4,050mAh to 4,350mAh. Plus, the battery is removable, making it a great option for long shifts or extended use in the field.</p><p>Don't sleep on the Galaxy Tab Active 5 Pro either. The tablet is rocking the same Snapdragon powerhouse as the XCover 7 Pro behind its 10.1-inch screen. But this tablet takes power management even further, thanks to its ability to run without an internal battery when docked. Additionally, you can swap out battery packs without shutting it down.</p>

<p>The Galaxy Tab Active 5 Pro brings the same tough design features as the XCover 7 Pro, including an IP68 rating for water and dust resistance. Even the S-Pen stylus gets the same rugged treatment, so it’s ready for whatever harsh environments you throw at it.</p>
<h2 id="sunlight-no-problem-2">Sunlight? No problem</h2>
<p>Both the Galaxy XCover 7 Pro and Tab Active 5 Pro come with Vision Booster, so you can actually see your screen in bright sunlight. The Tab Active 5 Pro kicks it up a notch, pushing the brightness to 600 nits, way up from the 480 nits in the last model.</p><p>When it comes to updates, you're set for the long haul: seven years of OS and security updates. That’s a major upgrade from the usual four OS revisions and five years of security.</p><p>The Galaxy XCover 7 Pro will be available for purchase starting May 8, while Samsung expects the Galaxy Tab Active 5 Pro to drop in early June.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>OPPO is crushing it in 2025; the debut of the Find X8 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">X8 Pro</a> allowed the brand to build decent momentum going into the year, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">Find N5</a> showcased just what's possible with foldables. OPPO is building on that with the introduction of the Find X8 Ultra, its best phone yet. Last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x7-ultra-review">Find X7 Ultra</a> was one of my favorite phones, and it was only bested by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-ultra-long-term-review">Vivo's X100 Ultra</a> when it came to photos and videos, so I was keen on taking a look at what OPPO is doing this year. <br><br>The Find X8 Ultra has a new design that's in line with the standard X8 and X8 Pro, and while the overall aesthetic doesn't quite stand out quite as much as previous years, it's great to hold and use. Thankfully, the phone retains the quartet of 50MP cameras at the back, and you get a 1-inch main sensor that takes outstanding photos and videos. <br><br>There are the usual upgrades in other areas, and I like that the phone has a 6100mAh battery; it lasts longer than just about every other device I tested in 2025, and is on par with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a> in this regard. While there's obviously a lot to like, the Find X8 Ultra has the same foibles as its predecessor; the phone is limited to China as of writing, and there are no plans to bring it to global markets.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oppo-find-x8-ultra-pricing-and-availability"><span>OPPO Find X8 Ultra: Pricing and availability</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="4y5iDEP8KFmho7ZU9DSr6F" name="OPPO Find X8 Ultra" alt="OPPO Find X8 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4y5iDEP8KFmho7ZU9DSr6F.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OPPO unveiled the Find X8 Ultra at a launch event in Xi'An, China, on April 10. I was invited to attend the event, but I wasn't able to go due to a visa rejection (which is incredibly annoying). Anyway, the device is now available in China, where it is sold in three storage configurations: the base 12GB/256GB model costs ¥6,499 CNY ($891), the 16GB/512GB edition is ¥6,999 CNY ($959), and the 16GB/1TB model is ¥7,999 CNY ($1,096). <br><br>The 1TB model is the only one that gets satellite messaging, and as I'm using the 16GB/512GB edition of the device, I wasn't able to test the feature. The Find X8 Ultra was joined by the Find X8s+ and Find X8s, with both devices offering incremental updates to the Find X8 and X8 Pro. <br><br>Annoyingly, the Find X8 Ultra won't be available outside China, and in a statement to Android Central, OPPO said: "The Find X8 Ultra is planned for release only in mainland China. However, many of the technologies featured in this device will be incorporated into future OPPO products, which will be available in more regions."</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oppo-find-x8-ultra-design"><span>OPPO Find X8 Ultra: Design</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kZBGdwgaEMJZgBFuZFQu5F" name="OPPO Find X8 Ultra" alt="OPPO Find X8 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kZBGdwgaEMJZgBFuZFQu5F.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OPPO always delivered standout designs with Find X models, but it is taking a conservative approach this time around. The Find X8 Ultra has a similar aesthetic as the X8 and X8 Pro, and it misses out on some of the design flair of previous generations. The Find X7 Ultra was one of the best-looking phones of 2024 thanks to a gorgeous dual-tone leather and glass design, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x6-pro-review">Find X6 Pro</a> also had a distinctive design.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="jdHsBUtNV8aHJcvXUFfM5F" name="OPPO Find X8 Ultra" alt="OPPO Find X8 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jdHsBUtNV8aHJcvXUFfM5F.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the X8 Ultra misses out on some of that flamboyance, it has the same great build quality. Most phones now use flat sides — ostensibly to deliver bigger batteries and increased longevity — and the X8 Ultra is no different. Thankfully, the sides are beveled, and that makes holding and using the device that much more comfortable. Coming in at 226g, it has a good heft and doesn't feel unwieldy in the least, and OPPO did a good job with the weight distribution.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="g7rDxYtz3wyG6kqTCndK5F" name="OPPO Find X8 Ultra" alt="OPPO Find X8 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/g7rDxYtz3wyG6kqTCndK5F.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Notably, it is thinner than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-ultra-review">Xiaomi 15 Ultra</a>, but you don't notice it that much because of the sheer size of the camera island at the back. Like previous years, the oversized camera dominates attention at the back, and the quartet of lenses are arranged symmetrically. I got the white model, and it has a matte texture that's good to hold — all while minimizing smudges.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="VbLRDFXE3NDv7MoKsbrp3F" name="OPPO Find X8 Ultra" alt="OPPO Find X8 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VbLRDFXE3NDv7MoKsbrp3F.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The phone is clearly built to last; I didn't use it with a case, and after two weeks of testing and several tumbles, there's no visible damage or scratches whatsoever. You also get IP68 and IP69 ingress protection, and I didn't see any issues using the device in a sauna.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="SxwD6DH2azkB2mzHAC3HAF" name="OPPO Find X8 Ultra" alt="OPPO Find X8 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SxwD6DH2azkB2mzHAC3HAF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OPPO also switched to an ultrasonic module this time, and it is fantastic; it is fast to authenticate and doesn't have any issues even if you use the sensor with wet fingers. The location is ideal — unlike previous years — so I was able to use my thumb to unlock the device without any hassle.</p>
<p>A notable addition is a dedicated button on the right that serves as a shutter button. Pressing it twice launches the camera, and you get to shoot with a single press, with a slide along the button to adjust the zoom level. The button sits flush with the mid-frame, and while it is a decent enough addition, I didn't use it quite as much — just like Camera Control on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>.</p>

<p>Another new inclusion is the Shortcut Button, with the alert slider making its way to a multifunction button. The feature is identical to the Action Button on an iPhone, and it allows you to toggle DND, launch the flashlight, take notes, memos, and so on. The menu to configure the button is also identical to iOS, and some originality in this area would have been better.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="VySdjCV53DwfBYo3BUSo8F" name="OPPO Find X8 Ultra" alt="OPPO Find X8 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VySdjCV53DwfBYo3BUSo8F.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I'm not going to talk about the panel too much, as there isn't much that's new. The Find X8 Ultra uses a similar-sized 6.82-inch AMOLED as previous years, and it has a QHD+ resolution of 3168 x 1440 and 120Hz dynamic refresh that goes down to 1Hz. The main difference is that the panel is fully flat, and it has uniform bezels of 1.4mm on all sides.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="AV99w9fQuHTtWpZT2ibb8F" name="OPPO Find X8 Ultra" alt="OPPO Find X8 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AV99w9fQuHTtWpZT2ibb8F.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The panel has standout colors and contrast levels, and I had no problems in this regard. It gets bright in outdoor use, and only the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> outmatched the device in overall brightness. Stereo sound is loud and detailed, and gaming is enjoyable on the device. With 2160Hz PWM dimming as standard, it's easy on the eyes too.</p>
<p>ColorOS has decent customizability when it comes to always-on styles, and you get a decent set of choices in tailoring the device to your tastes. While the overall brightness is lower at 2500 nits, the phone gets brighter in real-world use, and that's what you actually need.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oppo-find-x8-ultra-hardware"><span>OPPO Find X8 Ultra: Hardware</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="NJU3VbyzWVmApR2bqkKQAF" name="OPPO Find X8 Ultra" alt="OPPO Find X8 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NJU3VbyzWVmApR2bqkKQAF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the regular Find X8 Pro used the Dimensity 9400, the Find X8 Ultra goes back to Qualcomm silicon. There is no difference in daily use between the two, but the X8 Ultra tends to get hotter. This isn't just limited to the X8 Ultra — all phones I used powered by Qualcomm silicon this year had issues with overheating.</p>
<p>That said, the Find X8 Ultra is one of the fastest phones you can buy today. I didn't see any slowdowns whatsoever, and even demanding games ran without breaking a sweat. Having used over a dozen devices powered by this silicon, it's clear to me that there's more than adequate headroom; now we just need console-quality games to test the caliber of the hardware.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kjvmfeaBZbFUX5CH6hZVAF" name="OPPO Find X8 Ultra" alt="OPPO Find X8 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kjvmfeaBZbFUX5CH6hZVAF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As I'm using the Chinese edition of the phone, I ran into issues with connectivity in general. Calls tended to be glitchy (those on the other end couldn't hear me), and OPPO has hard-coded DNS as standard, so if you use a custom DNS, you'll need to go into the settings and use a static IP and manually change your DNS server.</p>
<p>Other than that, there are no issues. The vibration motor is among the best on Android, delivering granular feedback when navigating the interface and using the keyboard. While it doesn't have Bluetooth 6.0 like the Xiaomi 15 Ultra, that's about the only limitation I can think of, and it has one of the best hardware packages of any device in 2025.</p>

<p>One of the biggest changes this year is the introduction of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/most-android-flagships-are-getting-an-exciting-battery-upgrade-in-2025">silicon-carbide batteries</a>, and the X8 Ultra uses the tech to good effect. The phone has a much bigger 6100mAh battery, and it lasts a day and a half comfortably. In two weeks of heavy use, I didn't have to charge the phone before the end of the night, and more often than not, I just had to charge the phone once a day and a half. <br><br>There is no reason to worry about the battery, and aggressive memory management with Chinese ColorOS 15 makes the device last a little longer. Charging it takes just over 44 minutes thanks to 100W tech, and as an added bonus, it goes up to 50W over USB PD, so you don't need to use the bundled charger all the time.</p>

<p>OPPO knows how to deliver a strong camera package, and the Find X8 Ultra is one of the best phones I've used this year. It has a 1-inch 50MP Sony LYT-900 sensor (the same as last year), 50MP Samsung JN5 wide-angle, 50MP Sony LYT-700 tele lens with 3x zoom, and a secondary tele 50MP that uses the Sony LYT-600 imaging module going up to 6x. There's a 32MP camera at the front with autofocus. <br><br>The caliber of the imaging modules alone makes the Find X8 Ultra a real powerhouse, and the brand is leveraging Hasselblad's tuning to eke out magnificent shots. The interface itself is unchanged, and you can easily access the shooting modes and lenses via the viewfinder or the dedicated button on the right. <br><br>The device excels at taking videos, with all four cameras at the back able to shoot Dolby Vision footage at 4K60. That is a big deal in and of itself, but what's particularly great this year is that the device shoots Dolby Vision footage even when the ultra-steady stabilization mode is enabled.</p>

<p>Daylight photos have faultless detail and color vibrancy, and there isn't anything to criticize in this area. It's great that the X8 Ultra retains the 1-inch sensor; it allows the device to take better photos than just about any other phone today. I didn't see any problems in low-light conditions, with the phone consistently delivering vibrant shots with no visible noise. <br><br>But it's the auxiliary lenses that are truly noteworthy; you get four great cameras on the back of this phone, and the inclusion of two tele lenses makes things that much more interesting. The ability to get detailed shots at 6x and beyond is wonderful, and I got passable shots at up to 20x. <br><br>Basically, the Find X8 Ultra has one of the best camera packages I used until now. It does a better job than the Find X8 Pro, Xiaomi 15 Ultra, Galaxy S25 Ultra, and Pixel 9 Pro XL, and holds its own against the Vivo X100 Ultra and X200 Pro. The only issue with the camera is that the device isn't launching globally, limiting its potential. While the brand says it will use these technologies in other products, it would have been great to see the Find X8 Ultra outside China.</p>

<p>The Find X8 Ultra is available only in China, so it's using the Chinese version of the ColorOS skin based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>. It is visually similar to the global model, but includes a ton of extras, including a local digital assistant dubbed Breeno. It is just as fluid in regular use, and the interface looks modern and has a cohesive design. That said, it ends up looking like iOS thanks to the changes introduced this year. <br><br>My biggest issue with the software is the sheer amount of bloatware that's pre-installed; it's definitely more than what's bundled with the global versions. Thankfully, most of the utilities can be uninstalled. There are the usual issues with push notifications and aggressive memory management, and it makes using the Find X8 Ultra a little annoying.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="eMYoheQtPJikLuJ66CrGBF" name="OPPO Find X8 Ultra" alt="OPPO Find X8 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eMYoheQtPJikLuJ66CrGBF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Continuing with the list of annoyances, ColorOS 15 has the worst DND of any Android phone; it clubs calls and messages into a single category, so there's no way to mute message notifications and not get calls. This is clearly set up by someone who doesn't make or receive any calls, because in regular use, it just doesn't make any sense. <br><br>Usually, I'll have to do at least some tweaking to get Google Mobile Services installed on a phone running a Chinese build, but that wasn't the case on this device. The Play Store APK is included, and it can be easily installed, and then you can log in to your Google account and install everything else. <br><br>Coming to updates, the Find X8 Ultra will get five years of Android updates along with six years of security updates, and that is in line with most Chinese devices. Honor is delivering seven years of Android updates to the Magic 7 Pro, but that device continues to be an outlier — at least in the context of Chinese manufacturers.</p>

<p>I really like the Xiaomi 15 Ultra, and the device has a standout camera package along with a great design and all the other extras. The best part is that the phone is available outside China — it is now on sale in India and the U.K. I prefer the color balance of the Find X8 Ultra over the Xiaomi 15 Ultra, but there's no arguing that Xiaomi has the better software package as it comes with the Play Store and all associated Google services out of the box. <br><br>I'm interested in seeing what Vivo does with the X200 Ultra, because that may just be the only device that can do better than the Find X8 Ultra; the device is slated to launch in May, so we don't have to wait too long to see what it delivers.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oppo-find-x8-ultra-should-you-buy-it"><span>OPPO Find X8 Ultra: Should you buy it?</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kZBGdwgaEMJZgBFuZFQu5F" name="OPPO Find X8 Ultra" alt="OPPO Find X8 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kZBGdwgaEMJZgBFuZFQu5F.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You should buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You need the best camera package</li><li>You want a phone that takes stunning portrait shots</li><li>You need versatile cameras that shoot great videos</li><li>You want a battery that lasts a day and a half</li><li>You need all the extras</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a phone with the Play Store pre-installed</li><li>You need the same number of software updates as your Pixel</li></ul>
<p>The only negative with the Find X8 Ultra has to do with the software; the Chinese version of ColorOS has too many inconsistencies to be usable outside the country — particularly if you want to use Google services. That's why it's annoying that the device won't be debuting in global markets; OPPO has to do better in this area, and launch its best products to a wider audience. <br><br>Other than that, there isn't anything to fault with the device. It has a great AMOLED panel, the best hardware currently available, standout battery life with the best charging tech in the industry, and the best cameras. The main 1-inch camera continues to be a delight to use in 2025, and the auxiliary lenses are among the best of any phone I used this year. <br><br>The Find X8 Ultra does a fantastic job with videos as well, and I thoroughly enjoyed using the phone. That said, I still wouldn't recommend it unless you've used a device with a Chinese interface in the past. If you don't mind the hassle of buying it via a reseller and missing out on after-sales service, then I'd suggest getting the phone solely because of the cameras.</p>

What's important isn't that it's Apple doing it, but that a company with enough money to fight is taking on the might of the U.K. government because it thinks the cause is worthwhile.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-you-talking-about-jerry-2">What are you talking about, Jerry?</h2>
<p>In late February of this year, Apple announced that it "can no longer offer Advanced Data Protection in the United Kingdom to new users." the company gives us a good rundown on what this means <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/122234" target="_blank">on its website</a> if you're more curious (you should be), but the jist of it is that the U.K. now requires Apple to provide access to encrypted iCloud data for anyone using it in the country. Rather than comply, Apple cut off millions of users.</p><p>It's important to note that this is only directed at Apple, at least for now. Google, Meta, Microsoft, and the rest of the big tech companies aren't affected. They <em>probably</em> will be soon enough.</p>
<p>This seems like a bad call and feels a little unfair to U.K. customers, but it's neither. In fact, you could say it's the opposite and Apple is doing what's best; this is what I happen to think, though I'm saying it as an outsider who doesn't live in the U.K. or use Apple products like iCloud.</p><p>Apple and its trillion-dollar trust fund are taking the fight to the courts and have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://investigatorypowerstribunal.org.uk/judgement/apple-inc-v-secretary-of-state-for-the-home-department/" target="_blank">officially filed a claim</a> against the British Home Department's Secretary of State.</p>
<div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">More on security and privacy</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zvGvZFUbh54ojzukxuSCK3" name="google-pixel-keys-security-2.jpg" caption="" alt="Keys to your phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zvGvZFUbh54ojzukxuSCK3.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-googles-backup-encryption-works-good-bad-and-ugly"><strong>How Google's backup encryption works</strong></a><strong><br></strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/two-factor-authentication"><strong>What is 2FA?</strong></a><strong><br></strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/apple-gsma-rcs-encryption-standrd-update-confirmed"><strong>Apple to add encryption to RCS in iMessage</strong></a><strong><br></strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-encrypt-your-gmail-messages"><strong>How to encrypt your Gmail messages</strong></a></p></div></div>
<p>Granting a backdoor to the government is a terrible idea, even though it may help in certain situations. Most importantly, Apple has long promised to never do it and is sticking to its guns for the time being.</p><p>It's also very important to note that the official U.S. response probably wasn't what you thought it might be. Officials in Washington don't like the idea of a backdoor for the U.K. government very much, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/26/tulsi-gabbard-uk-apple" target="_blank">stating it has</a> "grave concerns" about requiring a company to create a backdoor that would allow access to any American's encrypted data, calling it a violation of privacy and civil liberties. There was no cheering from D.C., surprisingly.</p>
<p>This should matter to you, even if you think that authorities should have a way to access encrypted data through proper channels. And I do understand why people feel that way and realize that serious crimes and acts of terror could be investigated, maybe even prevented, by doing it.</p>

<p>These high-profile cases can't be the litmus test, though. For every international drug cartel or terror cell disrupted because the "right" people could look at the "right" data, how many times will this privilege be abused?</p><p>A little old grandmother who lives in Georgia getting busted because she grows weed to help with her glaucoma is subject to the same scrutiny as the next Pablo Escobar is. That means <em><strong>you</strong></em> are, too. People doing the investigating are just people and will sometimes take the easy route. Digging through a full backup of all your phone data is pretty damn easy.</p><p>I have no idea if Apple will prevail, and can't even offer a prediction. What I do know is that if this stands, other companies in other countries will become targets of the same types of laws and, in the words of the U.S. Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, our civil liberties are subject to violation.</p>

While we don't know the reason behind this price hike, many suspect that these tariffs were at play.</p><p>This trade war has got several people on edge, as China manufactures not just smartphones but also several other electronic components. And to be able to produce them in the U.S. domestically would take several years.

This time it laid off hundreds of employees from the Platforms and Devices unit on Thursday, April 10. This comes after the company has been pushing several employees to take voluntary exits for the past few months.</p><p>A source with direct knowledge of the situation said that people working within the Android platform, Pixel phones, and the Chrome browser teams have been impacted by these layoffs.</p><p>In a statement to the publication, the tech giant said that since they combined the Android and Pixel teams last year, they've focused on, "becoming more nimble and operating more effectively."

The Pixel 10 Pro Fold will allegedly get a $200 reduction in its price, bringing its price tag to $1,600 which is in line with a previous rumor we spotted earlier this month.</p><p>Next up is the A-series, or Google's budget devices. Android Headlines claims that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-10a">Pixel 10a</a> will be sold at the same $499 price point as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-hands-on">Pixel 9a</a>. Furthermore, the company will reportedly stick to the same price until 2028 with the Pixel 12a.</p><p>However, these are still leaks and need to be taken with a grain of salt. In a separate Reddit post, someone from Android Headlines said that they've seen the pricing for Pixel 10, 11, 12, and 13 series, but “it’s all subject to change” and that “everything is a rumor until the company announces it lol.”</p>

<ul><li>Google Messages is taking a page out of iMessage's book, using color to denote RCS and SMS/MMS users.</li><li>Anyone using RCS chats, both on Android and iOS, will have their contact name colored in Material You pastels.</li><li>The Google Messages app will also place a small RCS badge to the right of contact names.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>While there are a number of visual cues to designate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-rcs-and-why-it-important-android">RCS chats</a> from standard SMS/MMS messaging in the Google Messages conversation list, there aren't any before you create a new conversation. That could be changing in a future update, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-messages-rcs-labels-3543811/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> found in an APK teardown of the Google Messages app.</p><p>In the beta version of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-first-things-to-do">Google Messages app</a>, the site discovered small RCS badges beside the contact names of people who have enabled RCS when creating a new conversation. After tapping the <strong>Start chat</strong> button in Google Messages, the list of suggested contacts shows the RCS badge for RCS users and nothing for SMS/MMS users. The feature works for both RCS users on Android and iOS, which is notable.</p><p>The <strong>New conversation</strong> tab also changes the color of contact names that are using RCS. The color is changed from black to Material You pastels. These light shades are more clearly visible when using light mode compared to dark mode. This tweak bears a strong resemblance to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/rcs-iphone-launch-had-nothing-to-do-with-google">how Apple handles messages</a>, using blue to denote iMessage users and green for everyone else.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1396px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:72.64%;"><img id="wqtVrYMrZs4EKuDQzJosKP" name="Google-Messages-RCS-Badges-Android-Authority" alt="The color codes and badges for RCS chats in Google Messages." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wqtVrYMrZs4EKuDQzJosKP.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1396" height="1014" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's also neat that if a contact has two numbers, you can individually see whether one or both numbers support RCS. The badges and color codes for RCS could be helpful in certain situations when you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-set-rcs-chat-samsung-phones">can only send an RCS chat</a>, like if mobile service is unavailable and you're relying on Wi-Fi.</p><p>Since this feature is working in the Google Messages app beta, it could come to the stable release soon. However, it's unclear when or if this feature will be officially released, as Google hasn't publicly announced it.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-67">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google is discontinuing the Pixel 7a, no longer selling the 2023 model on the Google Store.</li><li>The Google Pixel 8a remains available, but is not seeing official discounts as of publication.</li><li>The cheapest Google Pixel 8a is currently $487 at Amazon, which is hardly a steal compared to the $499 price of the newer Pixel 9a.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Now that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">Pixel 9a</a> is finally available for purchase, Google is tweaking its lineup of A-series Pixels on the Google Store. For starters, the Pixel 7a is no longer available for purchase in any region, which was expected. The Google Pixel 8a is sticking around on the Google Store, but is still being sold at its full $499 retail price in the U.S. — the same price as the newer Pixel 9a (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/04/11/pixel-8a-discounted-everywhere-but-us-following-7a-google-store-removal/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>Google's Pixel phones usually remain available for purchase for a year after they've been replaced, so the Pixel 8a's availability isn't exactly a surprise. The same was true of the Pixel 7a and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-6a-review">Pixel 6a</a> in years prior, but those models received discounts to make their value more competitive. So far, that hasn't been the case with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a> following its replacement for the Pixel 9a.</p><p>The Google Pixel 8a is priced at $499 by Google, and third-party retailers aren't heavily discounting the older model either. Best Buy still lists new Pixel 8a devices at $499, whereas Amazon gives it a very slight discount at $487.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3388px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:52.42%;"><img id="Fo26idMcXD4hX75uNssTrn" name="Pixel-8a-Google-Store" alt="The Google Pixel 8a listing on the Google Store." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Fo26idMcXD4hX75uNssTrn.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3388" height="1776" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The U.S. market appears to be the only region in which the Pixel 8a hasn't been officially discounted by Google. The smartphone now costs £399 (an £100 discount) in the U.K., and €449 in the E.U. (an €100 discount). It's possible the lack of a discount in the U.S. could be used to drive Pixel 9a sales, so that the Pixel 9a isn't competing with a discounted Pixel 8a.</p><p>As for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7a-review">Pixel 7a</a>, its stock will likely dwindle now that it is no longer sold directly from Google. Currently, Best Buy does not appear to have any new Pixel 7a units available for purchase. Amazon is selling new Pixel 7a phones for $329, but it's unclear how long stock will last.</p>

The fact is, the number of fitness smartwatches that <em>don't</em> have a subscription is dwindling, and I'd be shocked if the remaining brands like COROS and Suunto don't decide to follow suit — not to mention Samsung.</p><p>Polar's "Fitness Program" doesn't lock key data behind a paywall like Fitbit Premium or Oura Membership. Even more so than Connect+, I'd call this subscription optional; your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/polar-vantage-v3-review">Polar Vantage V3</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/polar-vantage-m3-gps-hr-accuracy-test">Vantage M3</a> will function the same way they did yesterday.</p><p>Instead, it's a training program linked directly to your Polar Flow data, in case you want a cheaper, native alternative to TrainingPeaks. It builds a months-long workout program tailored to your "fitness level, effort, and recovery," adapting automatically based on your progress and daily energy level.</p><p>I intend to test Polar Fitness for myself, but early signs point to it being very useful to athletes! Still, Polar (like Garmin) has always appealed to athletes who like the idea of a subscription-free watch, and the Fitness Program is pretty similar to the Garmin Coach training program that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a> owners get for free.</p>

That gives it more universal appeal, but it's still fair to point out that some Polar fans will wish this program was free, too — just like Garmin Coach.</p><p>On the other hand, it's for the best that Polar made its subscription so specialized, because that makes it less likely that it'll lump other premium features in with it — while <em>Garmin</em> could easily throw any cool new feature into Connect+.</p><p>That said, if Polar wants more people to subscribe, it could follow Garmin's lead and make the Fitness Program more generalized, adding AI, premium data graphs, and more.</p>

<p>Some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness smartwatches</a> have always had subscriptions, but that was the trade-off for buying a cheaper Fitbit or Amazfit; if you had to pay later for Fitbit Premium or Zepp Fitness, at least the upfront cost wasn't bad.</p><p>With brands like Garmin, Polar, Suunto, and COROS, athletes appreciated the subscription-free experience so much that they'd pay more than the market rate for one, knowing it'll last years without any hidden fees.</p><p>Then Garmin broke rank and made its subscription the new normal. I doubt Polar timed its subscription after Garmin's on purpose, but it does feel like every other Garmin-like brand is going to see subscriptions as an exciting new opportunity, no matter how much their users grumble. After all, if <em>everyone</em> is doing a subscription, people can't take their business elsewhere.</p><p>I also think more mainstream smartwatches will follow Garmin's lead. Samsung has been building up its AI insights with Energy Score last year and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/im-more-excited-about-galaxy-unpacked-samsung-health-features-than-galaxy-s25">Samsung Health Coach and vascular load</a> later in 2025. Everything is free for now, but I fully expect all these insights behind a $10/month paywall by next year.</p>

<p>Sure, you can flip it open like some sort of Star Trek communicator (you can also make Transformer noises when you open and close it), use it in flex mode like a laptop, or just do everything on the small front screen if you like. But that's not why I love them; they <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/the-motorola-razr-2024-is-the-best-pocketable-phone-and-its-on-sale-right-now">make a big phone small</a> when they're closed and that's freaking great.</p><p>I picked the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Moto Razr</a> because it was cheap, but now the Z Flip 6 can be, too. Having more high-end but cheap phones to choose from is always great. <strong>Always</strong>.</p><p>The one thing I don't like about flippers is that when the battery is gone or you bust the screen, you're screwed. You'll never be able to fix it yourself, and getting it done might cost as much as buying a new one. My solution is to not drop it ever and let all the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-take-care-your-phones-battery">battery saver smarts</a> in Android do their thing.</p><p>You're likely to have a phone to trade in, and Samsung is willing to give you too much money for it if you buy this one. I know the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Flip 7</a> is coming later in the year, but it's going to cost a lot more.</p><p>If you want to get yourself a really great phone that folds up so it's easy to tote around in your pocket, give this a look!</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung has started a trial run for a familiar feature in its Wallet app for users in the U.S.</p><p>An email for a new "Buy now, Pay later" (BNPL) feature in Samsung Wallet was spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sammyguru.com/samsung-wallet-launches-buy-now-pay-later-trial-in-the-us/">SammyGuru</a>. The company's email highlights the feature's upcoming rollout, thanks to its partnership with Splitit for "Installment Payments." The Early Access Program for BNPL starts on April 28 and runs until June 6 in the U.S. While the feature will leverage your Galaxy device's NFC capabilities, there are extra details Samsung is highlighting.</p><p>First, users must have attached an "eligible card" and live in an "eligible state" to participate in the trial run.</p><p>The publication dove deeper, stating BNPL only accepts Visa and Mastercard payment options. Additionally, users in Arizona, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Montana, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Tennessee, Utah, and Wyoming are eligible to sign up for the test.</p><p>It seems that only users in these states will notice the Early Access sign-up button in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-wallet-vs-google-wallet">Samsung Wallet</a>. Users interested in participating can join the waitlist in-app, which will keep them in the loop about their potential acceptance when the time comes later in April.</p>

<p>Samsung is playing a bit of catch-up with this early access as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pay-adds-new-features-to-make-online-shopping-less-of-a-nightmare">Google Pay already rolled out</a> a "Buy now, Pay later." In 2024, the company expanded its range, bringing its services to even more websites. Google Pay lets users select from a few third-party providers like Affirm or Zip to split their payments into a few installments for purchased items.</p><p>However, Google reiterated a warning to its users following the expansion: missing a pre-determined installment will negatively affect your credit score or lead to "collection actions." For Samsung, while its early access didn't highlight anything like this, it stated that users could join its early test with "no required credit check."</p><p>Samsung Wallet updates have been relatively quiet; however, a recent update <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-wallet-digital-key-volvo-polestar-support-details">expanded its digital key support</a> to Polestar and Volvo. The update arrived with initial support for the Volvo EX90 and the Polestar 3, but Samsung informed users that more vehicles would arrive later on.

<ul><li>Apple Maps is now accessible on Android phones via the beta web client.</li><li>You can install the beta Apple Maps site on your phone as a progressive web app.</li><li>The web client still has major limitations, like a lack of support for Apple ID sign-ins.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Apple is working on a web version of Apple Maps that can rival the likes of Google Maps. The company introduced a beta Apple Maps web client in June 2024, and it now supports mobile web browsers, including those on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>. As part of the update, the client has moved from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://beta.maps.apple.com/" target="_blank">beta.maps.apple.com</a> to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://maps.apple.com/" target="_blank">maps.apple.com</a>, perhaps indicating that Apple Maps for web is close to exiting beta.</p><p>The beta Apple Maps web client originally only worked on desktops and tablets, but now supports iPhone and Android web browsers. While <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/04/11/apple-maps-web-mobile/" target="_blank">9to5Mac reports</a> that the Apple Maps web client is now out of beta, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/apple-maps-on-android-browsers/" target="_blank">Android Police</a> still saw beta tags on its devices — and we're seeing the same on our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">Google Pixel 9a</a> at Android Central.</p><p>The web version of Apple Maps still has major limitations. Currently, the web client doesn't support signing into your Apple ID. That means if you have saved places or guides on your Apple devices, they won't be accessible on your Android phone or tablet on the web. Additionally, the Apple Maps website lacks support for certain types of directions, like transit directions in some cities.</p>

<p>Although Apple isn't offering Maps as a dedicated Android app on the Google Play Store, that doesn't mean you can't get a similar experience. Apple Maps' web client can be turned into a progressive web app (PWA) on an Android phone thanks to today's updates.</p><p>This will let you "install" the site on your Android home screen for quick access to Apple Maps on the web separate from your default browser. You can do so by navigating to the Apple Maps website, tapping the three-button menu in the toolbar, and selecting <strong>Add to home screen</strong>. From there, tap <strong>Install</strong>, and you'll now see the app on your Android home screen.</p><p>Apple has already brought certain apps to Android, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/apple-music-youtube-music-playlist-transfer">Apple Music</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-apple-tv-app-is-finally-available-on-android-with-apple-tv-plus">Apple TV Plus</a>. Time will tell whether Apple Maps could be next.</p>

<hr>
<p>A surprising leak out of left field suggests Motorola is working on expanding its available wearable lineup.</p><p>The leak was posted on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/1910312297442038032">X by tipster Evan Blass</a>, who provided a photo of a new pair of earbuds and a smartwatch from Motorola. According to the brief leak, the company is supposedly working on new "Moto Loop Earbuds." Blass didn't go heavy on the details; however, what they provided was a (supposed) look at the gray loop design. These earbuds seem vastly different from what Motorola currently offers in terms of buds.</p><p>The Loop device features two hoops where consumers would typically expect the larger space for drivers and such to be stored. Beneath that looks to be its silicone tips for in-ear listening.</p><p>Additionally, the leak offered an alleged glimpse at the "Moto Watch Fit" design. It seems Motorola is chasing a more square design. The device's render is paired with a woven/fabric green and yellow striped band. It's unclear when we could expect these devices or how far along they are in development. Speculation on the specs may surface at a later time.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:275px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:218.18%;"><img id="3cJZcbqhQ2kipsYDSEndqb" name="motorola-loop-buds-watch-fit-leak" alt="A tipster posted a leaked screenshot of renderings for a supposed Motorola Loop Earbuds and Watch Fit." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3cJZcbqhQ2kipsYDSEndqb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="275" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Evan Blass / X)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The rumored Moto Watch Fit seems to take the design of the company's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.motorola.com/us/en/p/motoaccessories/wearables/motowatch70smartwatch#:~:text=">Watch 70</a> but with near flat sides and rounded corners that give us Apple Watch vibes. Motorola dropped the Watch 40 in 2024, which was a slimmer, more rectangular fitness tracker to rival Samsung's Galaxy Fit 3. With "Fit" in mind for Motorola's next device, perhaps we're looking at a more health and wellness-focused device.</p><p>Hopefully, this is a sign of what we've been waiting for: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/why-doesnt-motorola-make-another-wear-os-watch">return of Motorola to Wear OS</a>. While it would be nice to see a watch that leans into the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/moto-360-review-0">Moto 360</a> design, the return of a key player in the Wear OS ecosystem would still be appreciated. Other companies like OnePlus and Xiaomi have done the same, so if this Motorola leak is to be believed, hopefully, it doesn't disappoint.</p><p>Meanwhile, what consumers can actively take in is the company's latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/moto-g-stylus-2025-launch-details">Moto G Stylus 2025</a>, which is a tough, AI-ready phone with pen improvements. The company also quickly started up its teaser engine to hype consumers up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/official-motorola-razr-2025-teaser-clip">for the Razr 2025</a>, which might feature a third model if its short clip is anything to go by.</p>

<ul><li>Google has laid off hundreds of employees from its Android and Pixel teams on Thursday (April 10).</li><li>The company cut down its staff from its Platform and Devices unit, claiming that they're focused on operating more effectively.</li><li>Google's original decision to merge the organization's OS and hardware teams was a key trigger for these layoffs.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google laid off hundreds of employees from the Platforms and Devices unit on Thursday, April 10. This comes after the company has been pushing several employees to take voluntary exits for the past few months.</p><p>A source with direct knowledge of the situation told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/google-lays-hundreds-employees-android-pixel-group?rc=bdqvyp">The Information</a> that people working within the Android platform, Pixel phones, and the Chrome browser teams have been impacted by these layoffs.</p>
<p>In a statement to the publication, the tech giant said that since they combined the Android and Pixel teams last year, they've focused on, "becoming more nimble and operating more effectively." The Google spokesperson also stated that these cuts are in addition to the voluntary exit program the company offered to its employees in January.</p><p>This <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wants-employees-from-pixel-and-android-teams-to-voluntarily-quit">voluntary layoffs program</a> first opened up for U.S. employees in teams that serve Android Auto, Android TV, Wear OS, and the recent Android XR platform, alongside a wide range of Google and Chrome products. However, in February,  the company expanded this program to the People Operations team as well.</p><p>At the time, a Google spokesperson told Android Central that "to support our People Operations team’s innovative work ahead, we’re opening new roles and offering a voluntary exit program with severance for their US-based employees.”</p>

<p>Like Meta and other major tech companies, Google is pivoting much of its manpower and resources to focus on AI advancement. Meta, too, has had several <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-may-2023-layoffs">rounds</a> of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-social-media-reality-labs-layoffs-2024">layoffs</a> while touting the need for departments to be more "efficient."</p><p>Google said in May 2024 that it needed to focus on "moving faster" to improve generative AI development for Gemini. It seems like the company is cutting resources from other teams as a result.</p><p>Another reason for these layoffs could be that Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-reorg-changes-everything">merged Android and Chrome</a> under one "Platform and devices" umbrella, with SVP Rick Osterloh heading this group and the Pixel team. This merger could have led to redundancies. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/google-lays-hundreds-employees-android-pixel-group?rc=bdqvyp">The Information</a> states that this division numbered over 20,000 before the buyout offer and layoffs.</p><p>As of now, Google's total <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/google-lays-hundreds-employees-android-pixel-group?rc=bdqvyp">headcount is at 180,000 </a>despite laying off 6% (12,000 jobs) of its employees in 2023. This recent batch of layoffs isn't as massive but should still significantly impact these teams.</p><p>Android Central has reached out to Google for more information about the layoffs and we'll update this article once we hear more.</p>

<ul><li>A report claims ByteDance, the creators of TikTok, is pushing to create a pair of AI smart glasses.</li><li>The company is focusing on ensuring the gadget can capture "decent-quality" images and video without compromising its battery life.</li><li>During MWC 2025, Qualcomm and ByteDance announced a partnership to push ahead in the VR space and challenge Meta's Quest.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The developers behind TikTok, ByteDance, are reportedly looking to enter the competitive AI space with a new wearable.</p><p>Alleged intel received by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/bytedance-developing-ai-smart-glasses">The Information</a> from "two people" close to the matter claims ByteDance is developing its pair of AI smart glasses. The publication states that while this isn't the company's first foray into AI — they've made AI-ready earbuds and other gadgets before — this will be its first attempt with something of a larger scale. Its sources state ByteDance has hired "engineers with experience in hardware design" for work on this project.</p><p>The Chinese company seems to have two major focuses in mind: "decent-quality" image and video capture.</p><p>ByteDance reportedly wants these two goals to be met with its AI smart glasses in a way that doesn't compromise the device's battery life. More importantly, all of this has supposedly started within the past year, which is when ByteDance allegedly began its AI glasses project.</p><p>Additional specifics about ByteDance's supposed AI smart glasses weren't discussed; however, the report claims the company has started "talking with suppliers" to determine the device's features. Speculation adds that talks about its specifications, cost, and launch are also underway.</p>

<p>In a way, perhaps there's merit behind these rumors, as during MWC 2025, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-centrals-best-of-mwc-2022#:~:text=to%20its%20potential.-,BEST%20XR%20ANNOUNCEMENT%20%E2%80%94%20QUALCOMM/BYTEDANCE,-(Image%20credit%3A%20Nicholas">Qualcomm and ByteDance</a> announced a partnership that was more than we expected. To be clear, this partnership was between the two companies to hash out a next-gen VR headset, which would likely take the fight directly to Meta and its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oculus-quest-2-review">Quest series</a>. It's also worth mentioning that ByteDance acquired VR headset maker Pico in August 2021, which is even more evidence pointing toward its increasing interest in consumer-focused AI products.</p><p>With ByteDance now reportedly seeking an AI-powered pair of lenses, Meta's Quest isn't the only product it has in its sights. The company's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-with-display-rumor">Ray-Ban glasses</a> are also in sight — but that's probably far off, at least with how the current rumors paint the picture.</p><p>Most people probably know ByteDance because of TikTok and its recent clash with the U.S. government and its more recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/tiktok-avoids-a-us-ban-for-a-second-time-thanks-to-trumps-75-day-reprieve">75-day reprieve</a>. TikTok avoided another ban in the U.S., which was previously set for April 5.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung's Galaxy Ring charges with a proprietary case, and previously that case was hard to replace in the event it was lost or damaged.</li><li>Now, anyone can easily buy a Galaxy Ring charging case for $90.</li><li>The size-specific cases are available through Samsung's online store, Best Buy, and Amazon.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Replacement cases for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Galaxy Ring</a> are now widely available via Samsung and partner retailers, but they cost a staggering $90 — almost a fourth of the cost of a brand-new $400 Galaxy Ring. The cases were originally only sold through Samsung customer support, but are now found at Amazon and Best Buy, as well as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/mobile-accessories/rings/galaxy-ring-charging-case-size-7-ep-qq507cwegus/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">Samsung's online store</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/04/10/samsung-galaxy-ring-charging-case-replacement/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>Galaxy Ring cases are required to charge the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">smart ring</a>. After dropping the ring inside the case, contacts on the ring will connect to the case and start charging the device. The case has an internal battery for extra charging, and features a USB-C port on the back. This all means that if you lose your Galaxy Ring charging case, you'll have no way to charge the ring.</p><p>These cases are also size-specific to your Galaxy Ring, so you'll need to choose the size that matches when buying a replacement or spare charging case.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="VatnJ6pY3P8DFtkU2FBDbi" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Ring-gold-charging-case-09.jpg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Ring and its charging case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VatnJ6pY3P8DFtkU2FBDbi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At $90, replacement cases aren't affordable by any means, but they are now widely available. If Galaxy Ring users lose or break their case, there is a good chance they can acquire a replacement quickly at a Best Buy retail store or online with Amazon. This will help <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a> keep tracking without a hitch, and is a customer-friendly move.</p><p>Other smart wearable products with proprietary charging cases have similarly-expensive replacement fees, but they're harder to get quickly. For instance, if you lose a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses</a> charging case while on a trip, you will be out of luck.</p><p>At the time of publishing, some replacement Galaxy Ring cases are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Charging-Portable-Crystal-Clear-Protective-EP-QQ500CWEGUS/dp/B0DMFW1CY5" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">as low as $75 on Amazon</a></p>

You&apos;re taking a slight hit in the battery size, but the Google Pixel 9 boasts more RAM, better cameras, and Wi-Fi 7 connectivity. </p>

<p>Why buy the new Pixel 9a when you can save a whopping $400 on the base model <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Google Pixel 9</a> at Mint Mobile today? Sure, you have to bundle with one year of wireless to receive the savings, but Mint is also carving 50% off its Unlimited plan for a limited time, which means you could get a great phone AND a full year of wireless for a single payment of $579 (or $49 per month using affirm). Compare that with the Pixel 9a's starting price of $499, and the choice is easy. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/google-pixel-9/6810275/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="9af1600f-9267-4104-afa1-8bd9701ee53a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$799" data-dimension48="$799">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want an excellent Android phone with long software support, AI features, and some of the best cameras around; you live in an area with good T-Mobile coverage; you don&apos;t mind paying for a year of wireless in advance. </p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you&apos;re happy with your current phone plan; you can get a better <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-google-pixel-9a-deals-of-the-month">Google Pixel 9a deal</a> through your wireless carrier.</p><p>Let&apos;s break down some of the numbers so you can see why this isn&apos;t your run-of-the-mill wireless deal. For starters, the budget-friendly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Google Pixel 9a</a> starts at $499 while this Mint Mobile promo knocks the price of the superior Pixel 9 down to $399. The Unlimited annual plan won&apos;t break your budget either, as the deal knocks the price of the wireless down to a mere $180. </p><p>In other words, this offer gets you an excellent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> and a full twelve months of unlimited, T-Mobile-powered wireless for $579, or just $80 more than buying the Pixel 9a unlocked. You can also use affirm and pay $49 per month for the phone-wireless combo. If that&apos;s not an incredible Pixel 9 deal, I don&apos;t know what is.</p>

How much will it cost, and what kind of specs should you expect? No matter what your question is regarding the upcoming Samsung flip phone, the answer can be found below.</p><p>For starters, I'll go ahead and say that you can pretty much count on the Galaxy Z Flip 7 getting revealed this summer. Samsung usually announces its newest generation of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> during an Unpacked event in July or August, and there's no reason to think that this year will be any different.</p><p>We spend a lot of time gathering the most reputable leaks and rumors surrounding upcoming devices, and there's a lot to unpack (so to speak), so let's take a look at everything we know about the Z Flip 7 launch so far.</p>

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-we-know"><span>What we know</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="UFRGwVF3LTzpNBjdmRxwCm" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-with-Galaxy-Z-Flip-5-case-4.jpg" alt="The Galaxy Z Flip 6 wearing a Z Flip 5 case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UFRGwVF3LTzpNBjdmRxwCm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung generally hosts two major "Unpacked" announcement events every year, one in January and one in July or August. Using past years as an indication — along with the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">rumors and leaks surrounding the Z Flip 7</a> — we can predict with a fair amount of confidence that the Galaxy Z Flip 7 will arrive this summer.</p><p>The clamshell device is expected to be powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, with one rumor suggesting that the Z Flip 7 will be equipped with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-next-galaxy-z-flip-might-have-a-surprise-processor">a new Exynos 2500 chipset</a>. The phone is also likely to launch with One UI 7 and Android 15, and you can expect the Z Flip 7 to come loaded with all of the latest Galaxy AI features.</p><p>A few rumors also seem to indicate that the Z Flip 7 will adopt the larger cover display that we've been hoping for (think <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Motorola's Razr Plus</a>, but more Samsung-y), plus the phone is likely to sport a new-and-improved hinge.</p><p>Lastly, some chatter has been suggesting that the Z Flip 7 will be announced alongside a new "Fan Edition" version of the phone. If it happens, this Galaxy Z Flip FE will probably feature a similar look to the standard model, but you'll get a slightly weaker processor and a lower price tag.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-faq"><span>FAQ</span></h3>
<h2 id="when-will-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-launch-2">When will the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 launch?</h2>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 is expected to be announced during an Unpacked announcement event in July or August, with an official release date landing several weeks after the reveal.</p><p>This estimate is based entirely on past releases of Samsung foldables — 2024's Galaxy Z Flip 6, for instance, was announced on July 10th and released on the 24th, while the Z Flip 5 was unveiled on July 26th, 2023 and released on August 11th.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Xk33zq3Ca5579tvjuvpsre" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-review-16.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 display outdoors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Xk33zq3Ca5579tvjuvpsre.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<h2 id="how-much-will-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-cost-2">How much will the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 cost?</h2>
<p>Considering that Samsung already increased the price of its foldable phones last year, I expect that the Galaxy Z Flip 7 will be unveiled with the same starting price as its predecessor. That's $1,099.99 for the 256GB version and $1,219.99 for 512GB of storage. Even if the price doesn't increase any further, that's still a pretty penny, so keep an eye out for preorder deals once the phone finally gets unveiled.</p>
<h2 id="will-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-drop-in-price-2">Will the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 drop in price?</h2>
<p>While it's possible that the Z Flip 6 will become cheaper when the Z Flip 7 gets revealed, it's just as likely that the 2024 phone will simply run out of stock before any serious discounts get applied. Don't believe me? Do a quick Amazon search of 2023's Galaxy Z Flip 5 and see what you find.</p><p>On the bright side, retailers are sure to discount the Galaxy Z Flip 6 to clear stock <em>before</em> the new phone gets announced, particularly around the Amazon Prime Day sale event in July. Needless to say, Android Central will share the best Galaxy Z Flip 6 deals whenever they become available.</p>

Of course you did because you can't open the internet, turn on the television, or even look at the newspaper at the doctor's office without seeing everyone screeching about them.</p><p>The end goal of these tariffs is to bring manufacturing back to the U.S. I'm no economist and have no idea if this is going to work, but I do know that prices for things like phones are going to get a little crazy. It would be a great idea to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-is-winning-the-right-to-repair-race-with-pixel-9-series-manuals-and-guides">keep the phone you have as long as you can</a>.</p><p>It also means that you need to remember this when you buy your next phone and put repairability higher on your list.</p>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/personal-tech/iphone-apple-tariffs-china-bb20c7a3?st=6LvXxe&" target="_blank">Wall Street Journal</a> did a great job explaining how the cost to make a phone is going to rise, and you should have a look at it. Because it's a U.S. publication and the U.S. is iPhone-obsessed, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-vs-google-pixel-9-pro-apple-or-google">iPhone 16 Pro</a> is used for the example, but this same process goes for every phone or other piece of electronic gear.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:693px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.99%;"><img id="uU7GNyNb5nL8ksBSNmVRq3" name="tariff-cost-increases" alt="Cost increases for the iPhone 16 Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uU7GNyNb5nL8ksBSNmVRq3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="693" height="388" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Wall Street Journal, iFixit, TechInsights)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When the cost to make a phone goes up by hundreds of dollars, the company making it is going to pass as much of it on to you as it can get away with. That means you'll be paying more — maybe a lot more.</p><p>I'm pretty certain that the "big" players in the U.S. economy (meaning giant corporations, of course) will do something to force changes before we hit some sort of economic collapse and have to think about eating each other. In the meantime, the stuff you love to buy and use is going to cost you. Being a tech enthusiast has always been a pay to play world.</p>
<p>Some people want to be the early adopters and buy something the minute it is released. That's cool, but the rest of us might want to keep what we have right now and use it for a few more years. That means it's important that the company making it supports it long enough, and that you can do minor repairs yourself or find someone who can do them for you.</p><p>I've mentioned several times how much I like my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2024-review">Motorola Razr</a>. It fits me, and I'm glad I finally decided to try using a flippy phone and ignore the crease. I also regret the purchase because if anything happens, the phone is e-waste. There's no way I can fix it myself, and the repair costs are going to be more than just buying something cheap like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a">Pixel A phone</a>. I won't make this mistake again, and neither should you.</p>

<p>I know this is going to mostly fall on deaf ears, but we all need to stop buying phones that don't make it easy to replace the battery and the display. Full stop. I'm not suggesting we all run out and buy something like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-wish-the-fairphone-5-was-coming-to-the-us">Fairphone</a> or one of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/hmd-skyline-offers-something-other-phones-dont">HMD's new repairable models</a> (though, now that I think about it ...) but I am suggesting that a company that forces you to spend $400 to $500 to swap out a dying battery or cracked screen <strong>doesn't deserve your money</strong>.</p><p>In a worse-case-scenario you'll end up using the phone you have right now for two or three more years. I hate to tell you this, but you're going to hate it by then because the battery is going to suck. Batteries aren't designed to wear out quickly, but it is a by-product of the tech. High capacity and fast charging <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-take-care-your-phones-battery">mean a limited lifespan</a>. And none of us can guarantee that we aren't going to crack the screen before we're ready to buy something else.</p>
<p>It may sound dumb, but this kind of pressure does work; we've seen it in action. Do you think companies <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/7-years-of-updates-arent-what-you-think-they-are-and-samsung-just-proved-it">support their products for seven years</a> because they love us or because we complained and demanded it?</p><p>When you <em>do</em> go to buy your next phone, make sure you have a look at what it's going to cost to keep using it for a while.</p>

You were wrong if you figured they would be a short-lived fad or relegated to some niche corner where nobody paid any attention to them, and many people did. While not yet mainstream, they're not going away anytime soon.</p><p>They have their pros and cons, and some models do it better than others. One thing they all have in common is a big sheet of glass that can be bent across itself, then straightened back out (hopefully) hundreds of thousands of times.</p>
<p>It sounds a little bit crazy. I think most of us have broken glass and consider it fragile. It is. But with the right parts and the right techniques glass, like everything else, can be bent.</p>
<h2 id="folding-versus-bending-2">Folding versus bending</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3733px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="Rx8GrebHaZcAUbk2bPTbGU" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-One-UI-7-welcome" alt="One UI 7 welcome screen on the Galaxy Z Flip 6, sitting in front of colorful plants" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Rx8GrebHaZcAUbk2bPTbGU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3733" height="2100" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While a foldable phone may fold, the glass doesn't. Folding a sheet of glass would instantly break it, so instead it's bending, and yes there is a difference.</p><p>Take a sheet of paper and lay it on a table. Now grab the top corners and bring them to the bottom corners. You've bent the paper. If you apply pressure along the bend and create a crease, it's folded. Your foldable phone never allows the glass to fold, just bend.  this sounds a bit like nitpicking, but it matters.</p>
<p>Everything will bend if you make it thin enough. A framing timber in your roof won't bend, but a thin sheet of wood veneer or a branch on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bonsaiempire.com/basics/styling/wiring" target="_blank">Bonsai tree</a> will because it's thinner. If you apply enough pressure to bend a thick hunk of wood, it's going to break because of what's called tensile strength.</p><p>When glass, or anything else, bends, you're stretching the material <em><strong>outside </strong></em>the radius of the bend itself. A material's tensile strength determines how far it can be stretched before it breaks, and dense, thick materials are both stronger and harder to bend than thin materials. The force required to bend a thick piece of wood will cause it to break as soon as or right after it begins to bend.</p><p>By using a very thin sheet of glass, you're stretching less material and putting less tensile strain on it. This allows it to stretch and bend before it reaches its breaking point.</p><p>Don't get too hung up on this because it works just like you think it does — thin things are easier to bend without breaking. But thin glass is only one of the things that lets your foldable fold ... erm bend.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="bYYpsE9TK7qPYuLrhQA5sC" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-hands-on-25.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 closed hinge close up" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bYYpsE9TK7qPYuLrhQA5sC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Daniel Bader / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Making a phone with a glass screen that folds in half is a pretty amazing accomplishment. But as mentioned, the glass is just one piece of the puzzle.</p><p>That thin glass — often called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/galaxy-z-flips-ultra-thin-glass-may-not-be-glass-after-all">UTG</a> for ultra-thin glass — isn't the same as the glass used on other phones. It's been treated in ways that allow it to stretch even more than it normally would.</p><p>The exact methods and materials used are company secrets, but different polymers are injected into the glass and used as a coating over the glass to allow for a lower tensile strain during the bending process. Making the glass as thin as human hair (thinner, actually) isn't enough.</p>
<p>Next, you have to make sure the glass doesn't touch itself while in the bent position, but you need to do it the right way. There are two reasons for this, but from a design standpoint, it is important that the least amount of bending be used to fold the body of the phone on itself. Ideally, there is a larger air gap at the bend point than the outside edges, and the outer case of the phone is built so that it's doing the touching instead of the glass itself. It doesn't matter if the phone is a flipper or a folder, the glass can't touch, and the point nearest to the bend will have a larger gap the the edge.</p>
<p>That's where the most important part of all this comes into play: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-fold-5-display-durability-testing">the hinge</a>. Hinges have improved dramatically since the failure that was the first Samsung Galaxy Fold, but even that was an engineering feat.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="D36qT8zTVsJ4NCwZrceV5b" name="TECNO-Phantom-V-Flip-2-review-10.jpg" alt="TECNO Phantom V Flip 2 hinge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/D36qT8zTVsJ4NCwZrceV5b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A hinge must be designed to allow for fluid motion only in the way it was designed to, well, to hinge. You can't have unwanted linear force or any sort of warping during the process, and every time it moves, things must be very consistent. The hinge not only needs to be sturdy, stout, and precise; it needs to be durable as well. The 200,000th time the hinge folds needs to be the same as the first.</p><p>We see new hinge designs with every release cycle because it's the most important component of a foldable, even if it's not the most spectacular. There is no one correct way to accomplish this, and every company making foldable phones does things a little differently. They all have the same end goal, though: be strong enough to resist unwanted "twisting", be precise enough to meet design specifications, and be durable enough to do it hundreds of thousands of times before it fails.</p>
<h2 id="the-last-and-worst-piece-some-plastic-2">The last (and worst) piece: some plastic</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vkCxR4Vu6CQxMomk26Y7z8" name="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review-14.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold on Home Screen in-hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vkCxR4Vu6CQxMomk26Y7z8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you were to grab a foldable phone and press really hard on the screen with your thumbnail, you would be able to put a tiny dent in it. This is because you're not really touching the glass itself; there is a thin layer of plastic covering it all. If you were to grab a first-generation foldable you would put a bigger dent on the screen using a lot less force because this process has been refined a lot in a few years. The latest phones <em>almost</em> feel like glass when you touch them.</p><p>This isn't done because phone makers love the feel of plastic, it's done for the same reason the glass can't touch itself when bent in half. The glass on a foldable phone needs to stay as defect-free as possible.</p>
<p>If you look at the screen on your "regular" phone very closely you'll find a bunch of very tiny scratches. These have almost no effect on the operation of your phone and most of the time you wouldn't even know there were there. But they are, and they would spell the death of a foldable.</p><p>Any defect — a chip or a scratch — in a piece of bendable glass creates a weak point that will be prone to expanding as the glass is stretched (on one side) and compressed (on the other side) during the bending process. That means the glass is going to crack where the defect is.</p><p>A non-removable screen layer of a thin, flexible plastic material over the glass acts as a sacrificial layer that will absorb the abuse instead of the glass getting it.</p>
<hr>
<p>A lot of different companies now make foldable phones in several different styles. Now you understand how it works a little bit and know how things will keep getting better each and every year.</p>

<p>Google wants the leeway to roll out its Pixel Watch 3 updates over a "few weeks in phases depending on carrier and device type." But when Google can't even <em>complete</em> its rollout before moving on to the next one, it's a sign that things need to change.</p><p>I have two <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> units, a 45mm LTE and 41mm standard. Both are on the November 2024 update, which itself was just a delayed September 2024 re-rollout. That's nearly six months of unchanged software since I first reviewed it.</p><p>As someone with a Wear OS column, I had high hopes for Wear OS 5.1 coverage, like testing the new step-count algorithm, judging the UI changes, and deciding if the force-AOD dev tool should be a regular feature.</p><p>But the original March 4 update came and went, then the March 19 update window for LTE watches. But in my case, neither Pixel Watch 3 received it, no matter how often I tapped the update screen to trigger it. I tried factory resets in case old pre-release software from my review was holding back the update. Google told me it was "looking into" my case. But nothing helped.</p><p>Imagine my frustration as I see Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelwatch/thread/336962016/google-pixel-watch-update-april-2025">April 2025 Wear OS update</a> community post, which notes that "For those that did not receive the original March update, we will be rolling out an update in the coming weeks, more details to come."</p><p>In other words, while people had been expecting the update to arrive any day now, Google either paused the update rollout because of bugs or had a bug <em>preventing</em> the rollout to some watches. Now we have more weeks to wait.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="d48rhpLLvxaAKFhsSooiQc" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-downloading-update-forced.jpg" alt="Downloading an update on the Pixel Watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/d48rhpLLvxaAKFhsSooiQc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I wanted to write this post weeks ago — explaining why I couldn't cover Wear OS 5.1 yet — but Android Authority's Rita El Khoury <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-watch-buds-check-for-update-3533076/">made a similar case first</a> and my editor made me pivot.</p><p>Her point is pretty straightforward: right now, to check for an update, you go to Settings on your watch, tap System > System update, and then tap the screen frantically for about 30 seconds while the watch invisibly checks for an update.</p><p>It's a silly, unofficial method because your watch shouldn't say it's "up to date" if it hasn't checked yet. And if it's not available yet, you miss out on the initial enthusiasm and only get to test new features once everyone else has already moved on.</p><p>An obviously better system would be to let us tap a "Check for update" button in the Pixel Watch app, like you do with any phone update. But that only starts to fix the problem.</p>
<h2 id="better-clarity-on-timing-or-a-progress-bar-please-2">Better clarity on timing (or a progress bar), please</h2>
<p>Old Pixel Watch community posts always said the update would roll out "over the next week in phases." Anyone can wait a few days. Now these updates are requiring "weeks," and Google certainly didn't clarify in its March 2025 announcement that LTE owners would have to wait two weeks or more.</p><p>I understand why Google would focus on the larger non-LTE audience first, but the people who spent $450–500 on a premium model, only to consistently wait longer than everyone else, have reason to feel a little aggrieved. And all Pixel Watch owners deserve a bit more clarity on timing, if this is the new normal.</p><p>If Google doesn't want to commit to a written-down schedule matching specific devices to dates, then at the very least, it should have some kind of update widget showing the percentage of devices that (should) have received it. That way, people know whether they should continue to be patient or if something has gone wrong.</p>

<p>A month ago, I wrote that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5-1-kicks-off-new-update-strategy-for-pixel-watches">Google's new quarterly Wear OS update plan</a> made sense. Let me be clear now: that opinion was predicated on the idea that I'd actually receive the updates.</p><p>I still think the system can work, but we're seeing a rise in large, buggy updates. The September 2024 update to Wear OS 5 required a weeks-long rollback due to bugs. Now this March 2025 update has introduced delayed notifications and crashes from adding watch faces — and there's the fact that not everyone received it.</p><p>I don't have the coding background to judge anyone for buggy updates. All I can do are point out common-sense solutions.</p><p>Samsung started its One UI 6 Watch beta test in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/first-one-ui-6-watch-beta-hits-us-galaxy-watches">June 2024</a>, then pushed out a stable version in late October. It had 4.5 months of Galaxy Watch superfans giving them beta feedback and pointing out bugs. When the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> launched with One UI 6 Watch and the older watches updates, I didn't hear of any major software issues.</p><p>With a quarterly schedule, Google has consistent, months-long windows where willing Pixel Watch owners could test out new features and catch problems ahead of schedule — preventing time-wasting rollbacks. And for power users, it gives them a chance to try some features out early and feel like they're contributing to the community.</p>
<hr>
<p>I have to put this complaint into perspective: most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android watches</a> only get one major update per year, and typically fall a year behind Pixel Watches. So waiting weeks for a feature or fixes isn't <em>that</em> big of a deal.</p><p>But if Google is going to stick with monthly or quarterly updates, then I don't think the status quo will work. It has too many models now, slowing down updates. And catching every bug without beta testing is starting to seem futile.</p><p>As is, the Pixel Watch 3's confusing, delay-heavy update schedule is only likely to annoy the people (like me) who would normally get <em>really excited</em> about tiny feature drops.</p>

<p>No, this is not a typo, but the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-review"> OnePlus Watch 3</a> is open for users to buy as of April 10, but it comes with a huge price tag in the U.S.</p><p>Let's back up for a bit. In February, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oneplus/comments/1iswu8a/oneplus_watch_3_meda_in_china_misspelled_on_the/?utm_source=embedv2&utm_medium=post_embed&utm_content=post_body&embed_host_url=https://www.androidpolice.com/oneplus-watch-3-typo/" target="_blank">a Reddit user</a> noticed a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/you-cant-use-meta-in-china-but-the-oneplus-watch-3-is-meda-in-china">minor error with the wearable</a>. The company ended up engraving "Meda in China" instead of "Made in China" on the first batch of wearables that went out.</p><p>After that, the company announced in a press release that it would be pushing the open sale of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-has-set-interesting-standard-with-wear-os-5-and-oneplus-watch-3" target="_blank">Watch 3 </a>from Feb.25 to "sometime in April 2025."  The company needed some time to fix the typo that "slipped through" its first batch of watches. And it looks like today's the day that a China-based company decided to open sales for its smartwatch.</p>

<p>While people who wanted to get their hands on this wearable in the U.S. may see a massive surge in the pricing, the smartwatch which was initially supposed to cost $330, is now priced at $499— a $170 bump(as first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/oneplus-watch-3-launches-at-the-wrong-price/">Android Police</a>).</p><p>While we don't know for sure why the company suddenly chose to increase the price of its smartwatch without any communication, there's some chatter that it could be a typo or that the recently announced U.S.-China tariffs could be at play.  Starting today, President Donald Trump has levied a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/04/10/business/trump-tariffs-stocks">145% tariff</a> on products being imported from China, including electronics.</p><p>OnePlus told Android Central in an email "We don't have any additional information to share at this time." Hinting at the possibility that it could be due to the rising tensions between China and the U.S. due to this trade war.</p><p>But if you do plan on buying the OnePlus Watch 3, you could head to the company's<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oneplus.com/us/buy-oneplus-watch-3?irclickid=TSsXXoS%3A1xyKTxK2oyXNtUqfUksy5pzHUXRQ1Q0&irgwc=1&utm_source=impact&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_content=Future%20PLC.&utm_term=ac-ca&utm_campaign=12532"> official website.</a></p>

<hr>
<p>Google has just wrapped up the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/live/news/google-pixel-9a-launch-live-blog">Pixel 9a launch</a> on Thursday (Apr 20), and there's a new leak already revealing what Google's next smartwatch could look like. Renders of the Pixel Watch 4 have now surfaced and look pretty slick.</p><p>Leaker Steve Hemmerstoffer, widely known as OnLeaks, in collaboration with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/google-pixel-watch-4-design-renders-video/">91mobiles</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8UInUBIVaU">revealed </a>official-looking renders of the smartwatch. The successor of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> is likely to carry the popular circular design up front; however, the bezels are expected to be a lot thinner this year.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">OK #FutureSquad, today comes your very first look at the #Google #PixelWatch4 (360° video + sharp 5K renders + dimensions)!😏On behalf of @91mobiles 👉🏻 https://t.co/VhS5eS9d7R pic.twitter.com/wPOgVr86uY<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1910649694167994871">April 11, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>While the back design of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Pixel Watch 4</a> remains majorly the same, one interesting omission appears to be the removal of pogo pins at the back, which are utilized to charge the smartwatch with an accompanying charger. Per the tipster, Google might be introducing wireless charging for the upcoming smartwatch as the necessary pins are nowhere to be seen in the renders.</p><p>Another new addition to the Pixel Watch 4, could be the addition of two new buttons on either side of the speaker, which are indicated by two cutouts in the renders. While the other noticeable difference could be the thickness of the Pixel Watch 4.</p>

<p>The publication indicates that the upcoming smartwatch would measure 14.3mm, which is notably thicker than the previous iteration which measured 12.3mm. The raised thickness is likely due to the inclusion of a larger battery, which is still a speculation at this point.</p><p>Lastly, the Pixel Watch 4 should be coming again in two sizes — 41mm and 45mm, the same as the predecessor model. Aside from the renders, very little is known about what to expect from the upcoming smartwatch from Google. Since the renders are now out, more details are expected to be coming in the weeks.</p><p>The Pixel Watch 4 should be launching alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a> series in a couple of months from now, if the previous generation launches are any indication. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-series-render-leak-reveal-identical-design">renders</a> of the Pixel 10 models were also shared by OnLeaks very recently, giving us a clear picture of what to expect.</p>

<p>For entry-level wearable users, Garmin's Vivoactive line often serves as a great starting point, with the Venu series representing another step up. Now, there's a new Garmin Vivoactive 6, and it's available for purchase as of April 2025. How does it compare to the more expensive Garmin Venu 3, which launched way back in August 2023?</p><p>You might be surprised to learn that the older <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review">Venu 3</a>, with better sensors and a more premium design, actually outpaces the newer Vivoactive 6 in a few areas. The problem is that you'll have to pay roughly $150 more for those extra features, so the Venu 3 is only a worthy upgrade over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/leaked-garmin-vivoactive-6-looks-and-sounds-pretty-similar-to-its-predecessor">Vivoactive 6</a> if you'll actually use them. Let's break down how these two entry-level and midrange fitness watches compare.</p>
<h2 id="garmin-vivoactive-6-vs-venu-3-design-and-display-2">Garmin Vivoactive 6 vs. Venu 3: Design and display</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="W3NeCWhgzJFj5NMR63fLfJ" name="garmin-vivoactive-6-body-battery-press-photo" alt="A press photo of three Garmin Vivoactive 6 watches sitting side by side on tiny stairs.

<p>Garmin's Vivoactive 6 and Venu 3 smartwatches both feature a more subdued look and design language than some of its other wearables. These watches aren't rugged like the Instinct, sporty like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-165-review">Forerunner</a>, or beefy like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Fenix</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-ditched-my-apple-and-galaxy-watches-for-a-garmin-and-you-should-too">Enduro</a>. Instead, they're the simple kind of stylish you can pair with a gym outfit or something in your daily wardrobe. The style represents the "casual" look both product lines are going for.</p><p>The Venu 3 comes in two sizes, with the Venu 3 being the bigger option and the Venu 3S the smaller one. The Venu 3 measures 45 x 45 x 12mm and weighs 30 grams without a strap, while the 3S measures 41 x 41 x 12mm and weighs 27 grams without a strap. By comparison, the Vivoactive 6 splits the middle in terms of its overall footprint, with a 42.2mm case size that's both thinner and lighter than both Venu models.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="JxUb9xDNrvsf3r5TjZdaDi" name="Garmin-Venu-3-watch-face.jpeg" alt="A close up of the Garmin Venu 3 showing a custom watch face" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JxUb9xDNrvsf3r5TjZdaDi.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Garmin Venu 3 on the wrist showing a custom watch face. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>An advantage of the Vivoactive 6 is the smartwatch's support for standard 20mm quick-release watch bands, which can be interchanged easily. The Venu 3 uses 22mm straps and the Venu 3S uses 18mm straps, for reference. The included bands are silicone, but all the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">best Garmin watches</a> can be upgraded with first-party or aftermarket straps.</p><p>As the higher-priced option, Garmin's Venu 3 has slightly more premium materials. It features a fiber-reinforced polymer case, like the Vivoactive 6, but sports a stainless steel bezel. On the Vivoactive 6, the bezel is made out of anodized aluminum. That's part of the reason the cheaper watch is also lighter on the wrist. It weighs just 37 grams, including the strap.</p>

<p>Both watches feature AMOLED displays. The Vivoactive 6 is equipped with a 1.2-inch panel with a 390 x 390 resolution, and the Venu 3S matches that specification exactly. The bigger Venu 3 has a 1.4-inch panel with a 454 x 454 resolution.</p><p>The Vivoactive 6 and Venu 3 also both feature <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/future-budget-android-phones-will-have-tougher-screens-thanks-to-cornings-new-glass">Gorilla Glass 3 coverings</a> and a 5ATM water-resistance rating.</p>
<h2 id="garmin-vivoactive-6-vs-venu-3-hardware-and-features-2">Garmin Vivoactive 6 vs. Venu 3: Hardware and features</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SoxbEttapmCbcKsMDeEM2f" name="Garmin-vivoactive-6-press-photo" alt="A photo of four Garmin Vivoactive 6 watches, showing the four color options and various tools on the AMOLED displays like suggested workouts and images in messages." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SoxbEttapmCbcKsMDeEM2f.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Like the Garmin Instinct 3, the Vivoactive 6 is a refreshed Garmin watch without the company's newest sensors. The Vivoactive 6 uses the Garmin Elevate v4 heart rate sensor, which is the same hardware found in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/leaked-garmin-vivoactive-5-upgrades-amoled-and-battery">Vivoactive 5</a>. That means it won't get more accurate heart rate monitoring, ECG capabilities, and skin temperature detection.</p><p>It's unfortunate because the nearly two-year-old Venu 3 does come with the latest Garmin Elevate v5 sensor, which enables ECG and skin-temperature readings. As such, if you need the most advanced sensors, you'll need to pay $150 more for the Venu 3.</p><p>Otherwise, the two wearables are quite similar in terms of capabilities. Neither will have the kind of app support you'd get from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Wear OS watches</a>, but both feature 8GB of onboard storage for music. They both also support All-Systems mode for GPS, supporting GPS, GLONASS, and GALILEO.</p><p>The Vivoactive 6 takes it a step further with support for QZSS and BeiDou, but neither watch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/my-phone-isnt-built-to-handle-hiking-and-im-sick-of-it">supports dual-band GPS</a>.</p>

<p>In terms of connectivity, both watches support Garmin Pay, Bluetooth, ANT+, and Wi-Fi. Aside from the barometric altimeter (Venu only) and the aforementioned different Garmin Elevate v4 and v5 sensors, the watches have the same assortment of sensors: pulse oximeter, accelerometer, ambient light sensor, compass, and gyroscope. The Venu 3's altimeter means it can accurately track elevation gains during runs or hikes, which the Vivoactive 6 can't.</p><p>The Garmin Vivoactive 6 can last up to 11 days on a single charge, while the Venu 3 can top out at 14 days. Both of those numbers will dip significantly the more you use music streaming, activity monitoring, and GPS. You'll charge them using the proprietary charging cable Garmin includes in the box.</p>
<h2 id="garmin-vivoactive-6-vs-venu-3-which-should-you-buy-2">Garmin Vivoactive 6 vs. Venu 3: Which should you buy?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="SicvCQA8CsHUG3TXoyQdmj" name="Garmin-Venu-3-watch-face-2.jpeg" alt="A close-up of a custom watch face on the Garmin Venu 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SicvCQA8CsHUG3TXoyQdmj.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both the Garmin Vivoactive 6 and Venu 3 are designed for people who want essential fitness and health features in a slim and stylish package. The Vivoactive 6 has the advantage of being the newer release, but it doesn't make the most of it, with an older heart rate sensor than the Venu 3. That's why if you're looking for the absolute best casual Garmin watch, you'll need to pay for the Venu 3.</p><p>With that being said, if you're the kind of athlete or fitness buff who cares about the difference between Garmin's Elevate v4 and v5 sensors, the Venu 3 probably doesn't give you enough. Meanwhile, at just $300 and only a marginal downgrade from the Venu 3, the Vivoactive 6 remains the best entry-level Garmin you can buy — even if it's not a massive upgrade over the Vivoactive 5.</p>

Still, it's an excellent watch for casual users who just need basic fitness and health monitoring at a fair price.</p></p>

<p>Let's start with a similarity, such as their cameras on the same upper left side. The Moto G 2025 has a more square look since it only has two cameras, unlike Samsung's more vertical camera look, thanks to the triple camera setup.</p><p>Both phones have the same-sized display and share a plastic build that helps reduce weight and manufacturing costs. However, Motorola gives its phone a more refined touch with a vegan leather back. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-2025-review" target="_blank">In his review</a>, Android Central's Nicholas Sutrich said that he loved holding the phone because of the vegan leather back and noted the phone felt lighter than its actual weight. Rounded corners on both phones also make them more comfortable to hold.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy A26 vs. Moto G 2025 analysis also reveals that both phones have a side-mounted fingerprint sensor for quick access to the phone.</p><p>When it comes to differences, the Moto G 2025 is slightly thicker, measuring 167 x 76.3 x 8.2mm thick, compared to the Samsung Galaxy A26, which measures 164 x 77.5 x 7.7mm.</p><p>Samsung also wins in durability, offering a reinforced layer of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus+, while the Moto G 2025 uses the older Corning Gorilla Glass 3. Another win for Samsung is the IP67 rating, which makes the phone dust-tight and submersible in up to one meter of fresh water. The Moto G 2025, in contrast, is only water-repellent.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1188px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="JT3RhN6rpND3aVvVt3D5Qa" name="Samsung Galaxy A26 all colors" alt="All colors of the Samsung Galaxy A26" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JT3RhN6rpND3aVvVt3D5Qa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1188" height="668" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In terms of hardware and specs, both phones share a huge 5,000mAh battery, USB Type-C 2.0, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-micro-sd-card-android">microSD card</a> slot, and a side-mounted fingerprint sensor.</p><p>Both phones share the same 6.7-inch display but differ in the type of technology used. The Moto G 2025 has an IPS LCD 120Hz display, while the Samsung Galaxy A26 has a Super AMOLED 120Hz panel, offering deeper blacks and vibrant colors.</p><p>When it comes to screen resolution, Samsung takes the lead with a sharper Full HD+ 2400 x 1080, while the Moto G 2025 settles for a lower HD+ 1600 x 720 resolution. This means the Galaxy A26 will give you a crisper look when watching videos, reading text, or browsing, thanks to its 385 ppi pixel density, compared to Moto's 262 ppi.</p><p>Even with a few similarities, the phones have their differences. The Moto G 2025 has a less powerful Mediatek Dimensity 6300 processor, while the Galaxy A26 has a more powerful Exynos 1380 chipset. There is also a difference in the charging speeds, with the Moto G 2025 having a better 30W wired and the Galaxy A26 falling behind with a 25W.</p><p>The camera specs are also different. Samsung offers the Galaxy A26 a 50MP wide, 8MP ultrawide, and a 2MP macro, giving you more flexibility for group and landscape shots. The Moto G 2025, on the other hand, has a 50MP wide, and a 2MP macro, lacking an ultrawide camera, thus limiting your shooting options.</p><p>Samsung offers more storage options, letting you choose between 4GB/128GB, 6GB/128GB, 8GB/128GB, and 8GB/256GB options. On the other hand, Motorola only offers 4GB/64GB and 4GB/128GB variants.</p>

<p>The Moto G 2025 uses a near-stock OS and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> out of the box. Motorola gives this model two years of major Android upgrades and three security updates. While that’s an improvement over previous Motorola phones, it falls short of Samsung’s commitment to six years of software and security support. However, Motorola stands out by delivering a near-stock experience with minimal pre-installed apps, making the interface feel more customizable and lighter, which is ideal for users who prefer simplicity.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy A26, on the other hand, runs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/one-ui-7-is-here-and-google-is-taking-widgets-seriously-again">One UI 7</a> based on Android 15. This software offers new visuals, such as updated widgets and icons, split Quick Settings, smoother animations, and a Notification Pane.</p><p>With the update, you also enjoy a flashy new animation when you charge your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phone</a> and helpful gestures for adjusting brightness. Samsung also added a dedicated panel and useful gestures for turning on Dark mode. There are also camera updates making it easier to access modes in one-handed use.</p><p>The Moto G 2025 may not offer the features or refined design of Samsung’s One UI, but its near-stock Android approach has advantages. With fewer pre-installed apps, the interface feels lighter, more customizable, and easier to navigate.</p><p>Ultimately, it all comes down to whether you prefer Motorola’s clean, minimal approach or Samsung’s more feature-rich experience and additional years of updates.</p>

<p>Both phones come with Android 15 and feature similarly-sized displays, but they differ in several important ways. The Galaxy A26 offers better water resistance with an IP67 rating, making it more likely to survive accidental splashes or spills.</p><p>The Galaxy A26 also has a more powerful processor for smoother multitasking and an ultrawide camera for landscape and group pictures. Samsung provides six years of software and security updates on the software front, while Motorola offers two years of software and three years of security updates.</p><p>Overall, the Samsung Galaxy A26 vs. Moto G 2025 standoff has clarified that Samsung has better specs in various areas and longer-lasting software support, making it a more tempting offer. It boasts better value overall and is designed to last longer than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones">Motorola phone</a>.</p>

<p>Wireless charging isn't the most efficient method of recharging anything. Most wireless chargers tend to run super hot, which is unsafe and wastes energy at the same time. Accessory brand TORRAS has a solution to combat this unnecessary heat generation. The brand's PolarCircle Qi2 Wireless Charger has a built-in cooling fan, keeping your device nice and breezy.</p><p>TORRAS started out as a smartphone case maker, but the Chinese brand has since expanded into other accessories, such as phone stands, grips, chargers, and even power banks. The design language is minimal across the portfolio, with many concepts reminiscent of ESR's offerings.</p>

<p>The PolarCircle is meant to be a jack of all trades, combining 15W Qi2 wireless charging with a cooling fan and a rotating phone stand. You can even use the sturdy rotating stand as a grip since it boasts a ring-like structure. Since this is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/qi2">Qi2</a> accessory, it works with MagSafe devices perfectly as well.</p><p>I was expecting a plug-and-play experience with the TORRAS PolarCircle Qi2 Wireless Charger. As a person who spends six out of seven days a week—sometimes even all seven — testing accessories, it took me an embarrassing amount of time to figure this thing out.</p><p>Fortunately, the fine print on the tiny little user manual walks you through the steps with illustrated diagrams. I still feel like TORRAS needs to uncomplicate the process of turning on the cooling fan. It's not user-friendly at all, requiring you to press and hold the button, unplug and then replug the cable to get the blades spinning.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sp46TnQHiReJzgbrkxB7Rc" name="TORRAS PolarCircle Qi2 Wireless Charger" alt="TORRAS PolarCircle Qi2 Wireless Charger" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sp46TnQHiReJzgbrkxB7Rc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Wireless charging works as it should with the TORRAS PolarCircle, functioning smoothly with both Android and iOS devices during my review. The cooling fan does an amicable job of heat reduction, keeping the center of the device frosty. This prevents stutters and overheating issues on your phone, so you can use it while charging.</p><p>It's not the "coolest" accessory I have ever used, though. That award goes to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Cooler-Black-Shark-Magnetic-Semiconductor/dp/B09CGTLDB7/">Black Shark's magnetic coolers</a>. However, the TORRAS PolarCircle Qi2 Wireless Charger's temperature control is adequate for wireless charging purposes.</p><p>The charger is built well, and even though the ring-like stand is thin, it feels durable.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3766px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="8gKAksDf4UHcDnRKz87GBc" name="TORRAS PolarCircle Qi2 Wireless Charger" alt="TORRAS PolarCircle Qi2 Wireless Charger" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8gKAksDf4UHcDnRKz87GBc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3766" height="2118" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>TORRAS includes a 5-foot-long <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-cables-adapters">USB-C to USB-C cable</a> in the box, which is a pleasing length. That's a generously long cable — competitors, please take note. We don't want measly little 2ft cables, which is what most brands like Anker provide. This is the gold standard of cable lengths.</p><p>Overall, the $59.99 price tag gives you excellent value for your money. TORRAS frequently discounts its products, so you can easily score the PolarCircle Qi2 Wireless Charger for less than $50. At the time of writing, you can get it for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/TORRAS-PolarCircle-Mag-Safe-Magnetic-Semiconductor/dp/B0DGLM5BCV/">$42.49 from Amazon</a>.</p><p>I don't think you can expect a multipurpose accessory like this to be any cheaper. It's a fantastic deal, considering good-quality coolers set you back $30 to $40 alone. Add the cost of a 15W Qi2 wireless charger and a MagSafe PopSocket, and you're already looking at a hefty bill, with the combined total reaching $100 if you add a 5ft USB-C cable.</p><p>So, if your phone tends to overheat while charging, try the budget-friendly TORRAS PolarCircle Qi2 Wireless Charger!</p>

While there are several styles and designs in this emerging category, most manufacturers went with an ear hook design to position the audio driver just outside the ear cavity.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qJGhsFRrS42dnXwqjH3XCM" name="SoundPEATS PearlClip Pro" alt="SoundPEATS PearlClip Pro earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qJGhsFRrS42dnXwqjH3XCM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>SoundPEATS is taking a different direction. Its PearlClip Pro earbuds have a unique design that clips over the ears, and it somehow works. The design means it will be disorientating when you start using the earbuds — it took me a while to understand how to wear these correctly — but once they're nestled in your ears, they're pretty comfortable. These buds usually cost $69, but they're <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://us.amazon.com/SoundPEATS-Ear-Earbuds-Headphones-Clip/dp/B0DLNYJ3YR">now on sale for just $42</a>, and that's a great value.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JMUPioFJAiGRNKYvVJaZ9M" name="SoundPEATS PearlClip Pro" alt="SoundPEATS PearlClip Pro earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JMUPioFJAiGRNKYvVJaZ9M.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unlike most open earbuds, the PearlClip Pro nestle into the ear canal a little, but they're still much better in this area than regular earbuds. Coming in at 5.85g, they're on the lighter end of the scale, but I noticed a little strain around the lower portion of my ear lobe after wearing these buds for an extended amount of time. The fit does take some getting used to, and I'd recommend trying out the earbuds to see if you like the way they nestle around the ear.</p>

<p>The unique way they're positioned around the ear means they look a little goofy at times, and in the two times I walked around with these on, I got quite a lot of stares. Interestingly, the earbuds don't have traditional left/right channels — they're interchangeable. The only other audio product I used that had this design was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/meze-99-classics-review">Meze 99 Classics</a>, so you don't have to worry if you're wearing the correct earbud in each ear.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="zrNND7xwEABZ9VDQcis7CM" name="SoundPEATS PearlClip Pro" alt="SoundPEATS PearlClip Pro earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zrNND7xwEABZ9VDQcis7CM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The sound is pretty good; it has a 12mm driver and weighty bass along with a cleanly defined mid-range and articulated highs, and I didn't see any issues when listening to diverse genres. I will note that the positioning of the buds makes all the difference when it comes to sound quality, so you'll need to make sure they're slotted in just right.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="DMx8Aq7QqENhTkXfxVSMCM" name="SoundPEATS PearlClip Pro" alt="SoundPEATS PearlClip Pro earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DMx8Aq7QqENhTkXfxVSMCM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Each bud has a tiny 35mAh battery, with the case housing a 350mAh battery. It takes an hour to charge the buds within the case, and two hours to charge the battery on the case itself. Battery life is quite decent too, with the buds lasting over five hours on a single charge.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="nH8i8PmUzGRJFgN2zWSYBM" name="SoundPEATS PearlClip Pro" alt="SoundPEATS PearlClip Pro earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nH8i8PmUzGRJFgN2zWSYBM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The case itself doesn't stand out, but it is easily pocketable, and at 47g, it doesn't weigh much. You get IPX5 water resistance, so you can use these buds while running or exercising, and they don't wiggle out of the ear even while running. The PearlClip Pro gets a lot right, and while the fit definitely takes some time to get used to, I'll admit that they're much more comfortable than I initially imagined. If you want open earbuds with a unique design that stands out, should consider these.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google Cloud Next 2025 is officially here, and the first set of developer-focused announcements haven't disappointed. This week, Google is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/gemini-2-5-flash-pro-live-api-veo-2-gemini-api/" target="_blank">announcing</a> that its Veo 2 video-generation model is production ready and widely available for use via the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> API in Google AI Studio. Additionally, the company confirms that Gemini 2.5 Flash — a streamlined thinking model for basic tasks — is "coming soon."</p><p>As a video-generation model, Google says that Veo 2 is "able to follow both simple and complex instructions, as well as simulate real-world physics in a wide range of visual styles." Veo 2 will work with both text or image prompts, or both. This means you could describe to Veo 2 what you want your AI-generated video to turn into, provide the model with an image to work with, or a blend of the two options.</p><p>Users can try out<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-app-video-generation-veo-2-code-spotted"> Veo 2</a> in the Google AI Studio, and it can produce videos at 720p resolution at 24 frames per second. Currently, the big limitation is length. Videos created with Veo 2 can only be a maximum of eight seconds long. As an enterprise-grade tool, Veo 2 costs $0.35 per second of video generated.</p><p>As an example of what the model can do, Google shows off what Wolf Games is doing with Veo 2 in the video below.</p>

<p>The blog post also included a quick teaser that Gemini 2.5 Flash is on the way. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-2-5-pro-is-googles-latest-ai-model-with-thinking-and-multimodality-built-in">Gemini 2.5 family of AI models</a> debuted last month and has been progressing at a rapid pace. It first became available as a Gemini 2.5 Pro experimental model exclusive to subscribers, only to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-is-gifting-its-best-ai-model-yet-gemini-2-5-pro-exp-to-free-users">become available for free users days later</a>. Now, we have an idea of what Google is planning for the Flash variant.</p><p>"This evolution of our popular workhorse model will maintain low latency and cost-efficiency while incorporating thinking capabilities," the company said.</p><p>Finally, Google announced that the Live API for Gemini is now available in preview. This tool is designed to help with real-time interactions and "enables developers to build applications and agents that process streaming audio, video and text with low latency."</p><p>You can expect more announcements to come out of Google Cloud Next 2025, which is currently ongoing. Just yesterday, the company announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-releases-enterprise-grade-gemini-tier-in-android-studio">a new Gemini version for Android Studio</a>.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Google's A-series lineup of Pixel phones tends to be controversial. It's a mid-cycle release, which typically comes after the base-model Pixel is heavily discounted, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-shouldve-merged-the-pixel-9-and-9a">leaving a ton of feature overlap</a>. This year's Google Pixel 9a is more of the same but with a twist. To find out whether the money spent on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-vs-pixel-9">the midrange Pixel 9a is better than the flagship Pixel 9</a>, I tested both side-by-side for almost two weeks.</p><p>For the first time in recent memory, the Pixel 9a has a completely different design than the base Pixel 9 — kind of. The general oval-shaped camera cutout is still present on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">Pixel 9a</a>, but the iconic Pixel 9 camera bar is gone. With this change, the Pixel 9a's back is <em>almost </em>completely flat, but not all the way.</p><p>Starting with the good, it's nice that the Pixel 9a doesn't rock when it's on a flat surface. Despite being thicker than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a>, it doesn't feel gargantuan in the hand. The device measures just 154.7mm x 73.3mm x 8.9mm, which is only 0.4mm thicker than the standard Pixel 9. That extra space adds 400mAh of battery capacity, which sounds like a worthy tradeoff.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="H5QcxrTXFDs6ZWZZYYtkKj" name="Pixel-9-vs-9a-5" alt="The Google Pixel 9a in Iris compared to the Pixel 9 in Peony." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/H5QcxrTXFDs6ZWZZYYtkKj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's also nice that the nearly-flush camera lenses will help the back become completely flat when paired with even the thinnest cases. I have found that the exposed glass covering, without a camera bar to protect it, makes the Pixel 9a camera housing more susceptible to scratching or collecting dust.</p><p>In terms of materials, the Pixel 9a's matte plastic back doesn't feel as satisfying as the one on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a>, but that could be simply due to the lack of curves. The panel is completely flat, like the Pixel 9, embracing the rectangular design language of 2025 smartphones. Compared to the Pixel 9's glass back, neither phone feels inherently more premium than the other.</p><p>With that being said, the Pixel 9a looks bland and dull <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/why-google-pixel-9a-ditched-camera-bar">without the instantly-recognizable Pixel camera bar</a>. I look at the Pixel 9 and know immediately that it's a Google smartphone, and just don't feel that same familiarity with the Pixel 9a.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PfkXdYApkKnbdyzWbzrd45" name="Pixel-9-vs-9a-" alt="The Google Pixel 9a in Iris compared to the Pixel 9 in Peony." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PfkXdYApkKnbdyzWbzrd45.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The displays are both excellent-quality 6.3-inch p-OLED panels, with the Pixel 9a having bigger bezels than the standard Pixel 9. You can see the difference when the phones are next to each other, but I never noticed the bezels getting in the way during daily use. Both devices offer up to 2,700 nits of peak brightness, and the same resolution, so this isn't a reason to choose one over the other.</p>

<h2 id="performance-will-surprise-you-2">Performance will surprise you </h2>
<p>Things start to get tricky under the hood, with the Pixel 9a and the Pixel 9 sharing the same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4 chip</a> but with different memory configurations. The higher-priced Pixel 9 gets 12GB of RAM, while the cheaper Pixel 9a only gets 8GB. This means that while the Pixel 9 can run the Gemini Nano XS model, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-9a-low-ram-smaller-gemini-nano-model-report">the Pixel 9a has the Gemini Nano XXS model instead</a>.</p><p>In practice, the Pixel 9a lacks certain AI staples on day one, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-the-pixel-screenshots-app-on-the-google-pixel-9">Pixel Screenshots</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-call-notes-google-pixel">Call Notes</a>. Although the Pixel 9a gets the same seven-year OS upgrade and feature drop promise as the Pixel 9, it stands to reason that the former will get fewer features over time due to hardware limitations.</p>

<p>The really odd part of this is the Pixel 9a's benchmark scores. The Pixel 9a consistently beats the Pixel 9 in Geekbench 6 (trust me, I ran these multiple times to be sure). I can't figure out why, considering the Pixel 9 has the same chip and more available RAM, but can confirm that the Pixel 9a feels fast, smooth, and reliable during daily use. There wasn't any noticeable overheating either, despite testing in the Arizona desert.</p>
<h2 id="how-the-cameras-compare-2">How the cameras compare</h2>
<p>The positives continue as the Pixel 9a reverses a worrying trend of Google phones delivering photos with inaccurate colors. I have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-9a-camera-review">full review of the Pixel 9a camera system</a>, but the short version is that the new 48MP main camera brings the midranger closer in line with flagship offerings.</p><p>It adds features like Macro Focus, all while improving computational photography and color science, as you can see in the samples below.</p>

<p>Make no mistake, the Pixel 9's 50MP main sensor is significantly larger in sensor size than the Pixel 9a's camera. It also sports a 48MP ultrawide that will produce more detailed shots than the Pixel 9a's 13MP ultrawide lens. Both cameras will perform great in daylight, but the Pixel 9 is the clear winner in nighttime photography.</p>

<p>For most people, the Google Pixel 9 is objectively the better value than the cheaper Pixel 9a. When you look past the $799 retail price on paper, you'll realize that it's quite easy to find a Pixel 9 for only slightly more than the Pixel 9a. Both Amazon and Best Buy have the Pixel 9 discounted to $649 at the time of publishing, with the latter offering a $100 discount if you activate the phone at the time of purchase.</p><p>Yes, that means you could get a Pixel 9 — with more memory, a better camera, and a better screen — for just $50 more than a Pixel 9a. It's not hard to get it for even less if you're willing to take advantage of carrier contract deals (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-unlocked-phone">be careful of those</a>) or trade-in promotions.</p><p>Aside from the price, I feel much more confident that the Pixel 9 will get more features and updates over its software support window than the Pixel 9a due to the extra memory. Beyond that, the slimmer bezels, glass back, camera bar, and better display are just bonuses. That's why I think the Pixel 9 is the better buy for most people unless you're specifically looking for a basic Android phone with a long battery life.</p>

<p>Originally, I was ready to write off the Google Pixel 9a due to its debut limitations. With just 8GB of RAM, it isn't able to run the latest Pixel-exclusive AI tools on day one, let alone future tools that may be released years down the road. However, I soon realized that this might not only be acceptable to prospective Pixel 9a buyers — it could be preferable.</p><p>The Pixel 9a is decisively for the no-nonsense kind of Android phone user. It's made for the kind of person that will gladly take a conventionally-ugly smartphone with multi-day battery life. Or, the kind of person that thinks having fewer AI features shoved on their phone is a feature, not a bug. For those people, who just want a basic and good Android phone, there might not be something better than the Pixel 9a.</p>

According to several users on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://old.reddit.com/r/oneui/">subreddit post,</a> Samsung has started rolling out the OS more widely today (April. 10) as promised in the company's rollout strategy announcement last month.</p><p>The first ones to see this software update pop up on their phones are those with either the Samsung S24 series phones or the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Z Flip 6, much like how the rollout happened in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/samsung-finally-starts-rolling-out-stable-one-ui-7-for-galaxy-s24-series">Korea</a>.</p>

<p>Several users have been waiting with bated breath for this UI to drop since they saw some of its fun features pop up in beta versions of the OS. The build has rolled out on a larger scale but it seems to be rolling out to beta users first.</p><p>The highly anticipated  Android 15-based <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a> update, seems to be around 5.2GB in size and comes with Samsung's April security patch. With this update, Samsung promises to take its AI experience to the next level. Giving users enhanced writing tools, image generation and more.</p><p>To check if your phone has received the One UI 7 update, head to <strong>Settings > Software Update > Check for updates</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-expect-from-the-one-ui-7-2">What to expect from the One UI 7</h2>
<p>For starters, AC's Harish Jonnalagadda is calling this, Samsung's best software update yet and for good reason. Right off the bat, once the OS is downloaded and ready to go, users can see the change with the Notification panel. Samsung has now split the controls with the toggles sitting on one side, and the notifications on the other. But this can be customized to a "unified-panel" with all the controls together.</p><p>The One UI 7 brings with it a vertically-scrolling app drawer, ditching the horizontal app drawer. Other than that, this update brings the belowed "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-set-up-use-now-bar-samsung-galaxy-phone">Now Bar</a>," the pill- shaped bar at the botoom of your lock screen that shows media controls, timer, recorder, navigation, and other ongoing actions.</p>

<p>Other features include Live Notifications that show up on the status bar, the camera interface also seems to have got a fresh coat of paint making it much more organized, among others. Here's a<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review#section-samsung-actually-added-a-vertically-scrolling-app-drawer"> full list </a>of what you can expect once you've successfully updated your phone to the latest One UI 7.</p><p>Lastly, Samsung is said to expand its software update to older eligible devices (Galaxy Z Fold 4/ Flip 4/ 3, S23 FE, A34, A35, S22/ S21 series, Tab S9/S8 series, A16) by May.</p><p>The update has rolled out to some of AC's  staff in the U.S. who own a Galaxy S24 series device. So if you aren't seeing an update pop up on your phones as yet, don't worry as the rollout seems to be happening in phases.</p>

<ul><li>Google's April security patch has started rolling out the entire Pixel lineup, including the latest Pixel 9a.</li><li>The patch solves a few camera issues for several Pixel series while also solving the brightness drop problem some users faced in March.</li><li>The security update arrives just as Google's Pixel 9a hits the market for all to purchase.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google's expected monthly security patch is starting to make its rounds for its Pixel ecosystem.</p><p>Today (Apr. 10), Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/337176484/google-pixel-update-april-2025">posted the changelog</a> for the April 2025 security patch that involves its entire Pixel lineup. The company has shifted its version numbers slightly for users with different devices. According to the post, users with a Pixel 6, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9</a>, or Pixel Tablet will download v<strong>BP1A.250405.007</strong>. Users with a Pixel 7, 7a, Pixel 8, or 8a will see <strong>B1 </strong>attached to the end of the version. Additionally, the latest Pixel 9a will see BD4A.250405.<strong>003</strong>.</p><p>The patch notes this month are light but feature fixes for Google's Pixel camera. It states the update brings a fix for "camera stability" for users when zooming in or out in "certain conditions." This patch rolls in for the Pixel 6 and 7 series, as well as the original Fold.</p><p>Google is also rolling in another fix for the display for its entire Pixel lineup. The company says this fix should solve the pesky brightness flickering issue users suffered when using a streaming app.</p><p>The remainder of the changelog is as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Fix for issues with fingerprint recognition and response under certain conditions</li><li>Fix for issue with overlapping views on lockscreen weather clock under certain conditions</li><li>Fix for issue with Pixel Launcher when creating a new user or switching users under certain conditions</li></ul>

<p>One of the significant takeaways from Google's April update is the long-awaited fix for the annoying <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-owners-report-march-security-patch-problems">brightness fluctuation issues</a> users reported in March. The issue seemingly spurred off the company's March <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixels-march-2025-feature-drop">feature drop</a>, which brought a hefty amount of new features for Pixels and the Pixel Watch. Many users with phones from the Pixel 7 to the Pixel 9 reported their device's display brightness would "abruptly drop" when watching Netflix or Prime Video.</p><p>A temporary fix users found was to alter the device's fresh rate, but Google's official patch should remove the necessity for that.</p><p>Another issue that Google did not mention <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-users-late-start-alarm-issues-reported">concerns Pixel alarms</a>. Some users were waking up late in March as their Pixels — surprisingly — automatically disabled some alarms, leading to late starts for work. Aside from that, issues continued for Pixel users who reported <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixels-weather-widget-desync-old-forecasts-reported">desynced weather forecasts</a>.</p><p>Users stated they were seeing outlooks that were days old, which isn't <em>exactly </em>what you'd want. Google jumped on this promptly, informing Android Central that it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixels-weather-widget-desync-old-forecasts-reported">had started rolling out a fix</a> for affected users.</p><p>Also, you might want to check out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">the all-new Pixel 9a</a>, which breaks the mold for performance and visuals that some flagships just can't match.</p>

<ul><li>A tipster discovered signs in Android Auto's code that seemingly points toward smart glasses integration.</li><li>Strings of code mention a "Glasses" option and the ability for users to "start navigation" with their glasses.</li><li>This discovery surfaces a day after Google's TED 2025 demo, where it showcased its Android XR glasses "memory" capabilities.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A recent code discovery purports a truly interesting feature in development for Google's driving ecosystem.</p><p>Development for a curious new integration in Android Auto was spotted in an APK dive by AssembleDebug and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-auto-smart-glasses-apk-3543456/">Android Authority</a>. Alongside the tipster, the publication discovered two new strings in Android Auto's recent version that both contain a "GLASSES" modifier. The first string is simply the option itself, which is for a "Glasses Option."</p><p>While nothing concrete surfaced, this code only adds an option for this new feature, likely within its settings/features list.</p><p>The second string is more interesting as Google's early added code reads, "Start navigation to launch Glasses." By the code's name, it seems Google is working on integrating Android Auto's console information with a user's connected pair of smart glasses for AR assistance. Speculation leans this way, too; however, how these alerts or bits of navigational information could appear is unknown.</p><p>This code was noticed in v14.2.151544 of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-auto-review">Android Auto</a>, and since things are still barebones, we're likely still far from knowing more.</p>
<h2 id="google-s-future-of-android-xr-glasses-2">Google's Future of Android XR Glasses</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nXVvvRhiGjI" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>The timing of this discovery only pushes us in one direction: Google's recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-android-xr-smart-glasses-ted-2025">TED 2025 demo</a> of its Android XR glasses. The highlight of the demo was the glasses' "memory" ability. The demoer, product manager Nishtha Bhatia, asked Gemini where she'd left her hotel room key. Since she was wearing her XR glasses — and Gemini was being attentive — the AI was able to respond with, "The hotel key card is to the left of the music record."</p><p>Bhatia was able to relocate her key card on the shelf behind her, where the music record was.</p><p>Elswhere, Google stated, "These glasses work with your phone, streaming back and forth, allowing the glasses to be very lightweight and access all of your phone apps." With that in mind, there's a chance Android Auto could bring similar possibilities to Google's XR glasses.</p><p>If we're keeping things lightweight, the "Glasses" option would simply retrieve the information from your car's onboard software instead of trying to load up maps in its frame. Google's TED 2025 demo also showed a pair of glasses that only feature a screen in one lens. The company previously showed off glasses with one display and another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-ar-glasses-problems-behind-scenes">with two screens in 2023</a>, so it seems there are plans for multiple options.</p>

<p>Whenever someone gets their first VR headset, Job Simulator is almost always one of the first games they'll play. The game is as ubiquitous with virtual reality gaming as Beat Saber is and this has earned developer Owlchemy Labs quite the pedigree over the years. For that reason, the company's latest game, Dimensional Double Shift, immediately caught my eye.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/dimensional-double-shift/4449903565103159/">Dimensional Double Shift</a>, or DDS as I'll call it from now on, can be described essentially as a multiplayer Job Simulator. While Job Simulator sees you taking your time as one of four jobs, DDS splits the workload between two main job types to finish as many duties as you can within a shift. Each job supports up to four players, and you'll find that jobs change based on how many players are in the game and what workstations they're at.</p><p>While DDS is still a free-to-play game on the Meta Quest platform, the new Hexas dimension is the first paid DLC to debut. For $4.99, players will unlock Hexas and all the cheeky swag that comes along with it. Anyone can play in Hexas so long as at least one person in the party owns the pack, you just can't earn those sweet accessories unless you pay the $5. It's a great business model that mirrors <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/walkabout-minigolf-meta-quest-mars-gardens">Walkabout Mini Golf</a> and ensures that everyone gets to have fun even if they don't have money to spare.</p>

<p>Hexas debuts the launch of public lobbies, as well as a completely new dimension to experience the cooking and mechanic jobs in. While the base jobs are the same concept, the ingredients, stations, and even mechanics of them can be wildly different.</p><p>Let's cover the basics first. DDS is a hand tracking-only game, meaning you'll toss those controllers aside and feel the sweet relief of your God-given hands in the air. The game's controls are weirdly tactile, given that you're <em>just grabbing air</em> the whole time, thanks to a unique system where items lock to your hand until you perform an obvious "letting go" gesture. That means you just dramatically open your hand very quickly to drop something.</p><p>Players start out in a lobby of sorts with two jobs to choose from: cooking or mechanic work. With Hexas, the dimension chosen is randomized, so you never know when you'll get to fix cars in Hell. You'll just have to play to see when it finally happens.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kmQVSRmyCSoGaR9RcYdgue" name="dimensional-double-shift-hexas-official-screenshot-06" alt="Filling up a demon head in Dimensional Double Shift's mechanic job on the Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kmQVSRmyCSoGaR9RcYdgue.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Owlchemy Labs)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you've played Job Simulator, Vacation Simulator, Rick and Morty: Virtual Rick-ality, or Cosmonious High, you'll immediately feel at home with the game's mechanics. As a cook, you'll grab an order ticket and assemble it as quickly as you can, and the fastest players will complete more orders than everyone else. The mechanic job is more about teamwork since the entire team works on a single car rather than individual vehicles.</p><p>Owlchemy Labs games are wildly creative and are best enjoyed by people who enjoy role playing and exploration. As the CEO of Owlchemy Labs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/vr-wishlist-2024">once told me</a>, the best VR games "let you roleplay and don't put exposition in the way of your roleplaying."</p><p>That means when you start a job in Dimensional Double Shift, the workstation is your canvas. Each work station has completely different tools and machines with which to work. You don't move between stations during a shift, ensuring that teamwork is required when one person's problem requires a tool or part they don't have immediate access to.</p><p>Like all other Owlchemy Labs games, this is built for players with all sorts of heights and abilities, so you can adjust the height of your workstation on the fly, pass parts and ingredients between players, use hand gestures and your voice to communicate with other players, and so forth.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="U33o3WM5gFEX9SHzX36pue" name="dimensional-double-shift-hexas-official-screenshot-04" alt="Growing plants with blood in Dimensional Double Shift's cook job on the Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U33o3WM5gFEX9SHzX36pue.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Owlchemy Labs)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>DDS's first dimension, Treeattle, is a parody play on the hipster hippy culture you might find in suburban and downtown Seattle. Hexas, likewise, is a parody of the larger-than-life attitudes and lifestyles you'll find in Texas, just with a demonic twist for comedic effect.</p><p>As with any good Owlchemy game, DDS rewards players for thinking outside of the box and combining items that otherwise might not go together. It also heavily leans into the alternate dimension concept where cars might have milkable udders or demonic patrons might enjoy a literal <em>bloody</em> Mary drink.</p><p>Everything is so ridiculous that it ups the fun factor even beyond what was in the original dimension, and the humor is just the right mix between older-kid-friendly and still hilarious to adults who understand the references.</p>

<p>As I've written about several times before, I love playing VR games with my family. Whether it's Dungeons of Eternity <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/you-should-play-more-video-games-with-your-kids">with my son</a> or Walkabout Mini Golf <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/at-home-date-nights-are-better-in-vr-no-seriously">with my wife</a>, there's  a real joy that comes with playing VR games with other people. For that reason, I absolutely had to play this one with them and the results couldn't have been better.</p><p>My son typically hates hand tracking games, but Owlchemy Labs has been perfecting hand tracking since Job Simulator and it shows. He didn't once complain about not being able to use controllers — something that's never happened with other hand tracking games — and was moving around with the precision normally only associated with using motion-tracked VR controllers.</p><p>My wife also enjoyed the heck out of the game, especially during the mechanic section when we had to co-op fix several different broken car parts. It was like putting both our hands on a physical puzzle and working together to solve it. The teamwork was amazing.</p>

<p>Owlchemy's CEO, Andrew Eiche, told me the company is already hard at work on the next big update. While he didn't commit to what sorts of new jobs we can look forward to, I'm confident that the next update will once again reinvent what DDS players have come to expect.</p><p>Now that lobbies can be publicly searched, it'll be significantly easier to find players online when you're friends (or family) aren't available to play. Given how great Owlchemy's previous games were when played in a room with other people, it shouldn't come as to any surprise that this game is a <strong>blast</strong> to play online.</p><p>Owlchemy's first online multiplayer game is a huge success — the game already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://owlchemylabs.com/blog/dimensional-double-shift-surpasses-500000-employees-players-becomes-owlchemy-labs-fastest-growing-title-ever">surpassed 500,000 downloads</a> and is the fastest-growing Owlchemy game ever — and Hexas doubles the fun for just $5. Hard to say no to that.</p>

<p>It's quite literally impossible to find a better phone for $107. The Google Pixel 9a not only packs the latest version of Android with nearly all the best Pixel features, but it also packs the same Tensor G4 processor as all the most expensive Pixel 9 phones. In short, that means Pixel flagship-level performance for a lot less money.</p><p>Be aware, though, that the Pixel 9a doesn't include <em>all</em> the same AI features that are in the more expensive Pixel phones <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-9a-low-ram-smaller-gemini-nano-model-report">because it has less RAM</a>. That Gemini XXS model is still plenty capable, for sure, and will get you access to features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-use-call-screen-feature-pixel">Call Screening</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-use-best-take-on-the-pixel-8">Best Take</a>, as well as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-lives-video-streaming-screen-sharing-support-comes-to-pixel-9-series">Gemini Live</a>.</p><p>This year, Google has outfitted the Pixel 9a with an upgraded ultrawide lens that includes a new macro focus mode so you can take gorgeous up-close shots this Spring. We put the camera to the test in our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-9a-camera-review">Pixel 9a camera review</a>, so you can get an idea of what to look forward to when your unit arrives.</p><p>Once you've secured the epic AT&T deal, take a look at the best <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9a-screen-protectors">Pixel 9a screen protectors</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9a-cases">Pixel 9a cases</a> to keep your investment protected. You won't lose much money if your phone breaks, thanks to this excellent deal, but it'll be hard to replace it at this same low price if that happens.</p>
