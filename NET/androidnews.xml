Post the earnings announcement, Meta's stocks jumped by approximately 10% as well.</p><p>"We've had a strong quarter both in terms of our business and community," said Mark Zuckerberg, Meta founder and CEO, in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_downloads/Meta-06-30-2025-Exhibit-99-1-FINAL.pdf">press release</a>.

This number is seemingly higher than what analysts expected ($44.07 billion). Zuckerberg said during the earnings call today that this strong momentum in digital advertising was driven by AI, with roughly 5% more ad conversions on Instagram and 3% on Facebook.</p><p>"Meaningful percentage of our ad revenue now coming from campaigns using one of our generative AI features, this is going to be especially valuable for smaller advertisers with limited budgets, while agencies will continue the important work to help larger brands apply these tools strategically," he added.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fqSRrLBJSDKzUtEA5fPNjT" name="Meta-Ray-Ban-Limited-Edition-3" alt="Ray-Ban Meta limited edition transparent smart glasses." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fqSRrLBJSDKzUtEA5fPNjT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That said, the company's<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-q2-2024-earnings"> Reality Labs continues to operate at a loss </a>of $4.5 billion with sales of $370 million.

Li said that Meta is ramping up production on these glasses to meet the demand later this year.</p><p>Other than that, Zuckerberg indicated that AI advancements also helped users stay on Meta's platforms like Facebook and Instagram for longer and continued to show strong engagement. Daily active people across Meta's platforms reached 3.48 billion, up 6% from a year ago. "Q2, total family of apps, revenue was $47.1 billion, up 22% year over year. Q2, family of apps, ad revenue was $46.6 billion, up 21% or 22% on a constant currency basis," said Li.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="AMDmQ7j9FheNMVoBMDTpCg" name="meta-ai-logo-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-in-front-01" alt="A Meta AI logo on a laptop with a pair of Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses in front" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AMDmQ7j9FheNMVoBMDTpCg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Meta has also been aggressively pursuing AI opportunities, so much so that Zuckerberg stated that over the last few months, Meta's AI models have been slowly yet steadily evolving toward <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/superintelligence/">super intelligence</a>, "which we define as AI that surpasses human intelligence in every way we think, is now in sight."</p><p>Meta spent approximately $17.01 billion, directed toward building more AI infrastructure, like new data centers and advanced research. It is important to note that the company has also adjusted its estimated expenditure for the year ahead to $66 billion to $72 billion, an increase of approximately $30 billion compared to the previous year.</p><p>Looking ahead, the company expects a similar uptick in revenue in Q3 as well.

It lets you swipe back and get a quick look at the last page, making it easier to avoid going back by accident.</p><p>Mishaal Rahman over at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-chrome-back-forward-animations-3582562/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> has spotted Google Chrome's new back animation. It is showing up gradually, so not everyone will see it right away. That said, Rahman caught it running on a clean install of Chrome 138 (the latest stable version).</p><p>Swiping from the edge now brings up a preview of where you’re headed, sliding the next page partway in so you can decide if you actually want to go there.</p><p>The new back animation in Chrome looks a lot like what Safari does on iOS. Android’s own predictive back system also borrows a bit from the iPhone.</p><h2 id="wanna-try-it-now-2">Wanna try it now?</h2><p>If you’re curious to try the new Chrome animation early, you don’t have to wait. Just drop the flag URL below into the address bar and hit enter. Then, it’ll take you straight to the setting. Open the dropdown, switch it to “Enabled,” and tap “Relaunch” to turn it on.</p><pre class="line-numbers language-" language="" ><code>chrome://flags/#back-forward-transitions</code></pre><p>The feature behaves a bit differently if the previous screen wasn’t just another page in your browsing history. In other words, it adjusts based on where you came from.</p><p>Chrome’s back swipe doesn’t always show the same thing, as it depends on how you landed on the page. If you opened it from another app, you’ll catch a glimpse of that app as you swipe.</p><p>If it leads back to a new tab, you’ll just get a blank gray screen with the Chrome logo. But if the page came from a link in another tab, don’t expect a preview since it’ll just snap back without the animation.</p><h2 id="visual-previews-that-actually-help-2">Visual previews that actually help</h2><p>Chrome’s new animation builds on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-early-deep-dive-expected-features">Android’s predictive back gesture</a>, which started evolving in Android 13. But Chrome pushes it further: holding a back swipe doesn’t just show a vague app switch anymore. You actually get a live preview of the last webpage, smoothly scaled and faded in.</p><p>While it’s a subtle touch, it could help cut down on annoying accidental exits from something important.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Instead of showing a “Jump Ahead” button when you try to skip past a popular spot, it marks the ideal skip point with a dot on the progress bar.

The latest beta is seemingly light on new features, at least in its changelog. Starting, the patch notes state Beta 4 has added "support for high quality voice, video, and enhanced chat services" in the Samsung IMS Service Emergency feature.</p><p>The update also brings full-screen support for videos when switching using Samsung DeX.</p><p>One UI 8 Beta 4 dives into its bug fixes heavily, as Samsung is likely (hopefully) on the final stretch for its testing with users. Some of the standout fixes include a solution to a bug users encountered with outgoing calls via Swipe to Call. This bug occurred when attempting to call someone on your contacts list when TalkBack was enabled. There's a bug fix on its way for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-launch">Galaxy S25 series'</a> camera.</p><p>Samsung states the "flickering issue," present on the horizontal/vertical leveling icon when switching between the front and rear cameras, has been fixed.

The company's entire Good Lock module toolkit was updated last week to line up with what it's been testing and getting ready for One UI 8. While updates to Home Up let users change how apps start up, it also upgraded MultiStar, NavStar, and QuickStar.</p><p>Those modules have now moved into a more One UI 8-ready state. Hopefully, we're looking at an August launch for Samsung's Android 16 update officially.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

As expected, this initial closed beta test is for the Phone 3 model, which runs Android 16 throughout its entirety. Nothing explains to interested testers that this first build will focus on "delivering Android 16’s native features as well as implementing a more robust design system which will set the foundation for a more cohesive UI moving forward."</p><p>The company didn't divulge the features users could see on the Phone 3; however, it highlighted the conditions users might meet before joining.</p><p>Considering it's an early beta, Nothing stresses confidentiality to potential testers. It also teases that this first closed beta will likely last between August to "early" September. Nothing is looking for users who utilize their Phone 3 daily and are willing to engage and provide feedback to the team.</p><p>Users can begin <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nothing-tech.sg.larksuite.com/share/base/form/shrlgKaR9D6Cuqepd6CzJXDrRlc">filling out the signup form</a> for the Nothing OS 4.0 closed beta.

Shortly after, the company's CEO, Carl Pei, highlighted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-phones-to-get-android-16-powered-nothing-os-4-0-later-this-year">plans to bring Android 16</a> to users this year.

The company is preparing to support the Phone 3 with five years of Android OS upgrades and seven years of security patches. While its Android OS side isn't quite up to Google's or Samsung's level of support, it's a good start in Nothing's "true flagship" direction.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="492a75a3-7d56-44b0-88c8-81de14e1e249">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LdeEWY6LkaLEKRNnhJp4dY.jpg' alt="An official product render of the black Nothing Phone 3"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Nothing Phone 3</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The Nothing Phone 3 is the brand's first major step into the world of a "true flagship."

Aside from the initial onboarding where you sign into Google and download a few apps, Samsung largely leaves you to figure things out for yourself. You can easily miss out on quality-of-life features if you don't search through menus for them.</p><p>That's where I come in. Having reviewed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic-review">Galaxy Watch 8 Classic</a> — as well as the Ultra, 6 Classic, and 5 Pro — I'm intimately familiar with Samsung's One UI Watch software, including the newest features like the Multi-Info Tiles, Now Bar, and Gemini that you'll want to dive into straight away.</p><p>These are the 10 Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 features or settings to activate or change straight out of the box. <em><strong>Note:</strong></em> You'll find Settings by either swiping down from the main watch face and tapping the cog icon or opening the Galaxy Wearable app on your phone.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-enable-gestures-and-shortcuts"><span>Enable gestures and shortcuts</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="QojuSoMeMS9vQvpu2wAaA6" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-close-up-on-bezel" alt="Close-up of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic's rotating bezel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QojuSoMeMS9vQvpu2wAaA6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Even the best smartwatch UI can be tedious to navigate through, by virtue of the small screen. Save yourself a bunch of time by enabling shortcuts to your favorite apps out of the box.</p><p>Tap <strong>Settings > Buttons and Gestures</strong>. Here, Galaxy Watch 8 owners will find two shortcuts for the Home button; I like changing the Home double press to open my favorite app instead of the last app opened, and the long press to open Gemini instead of Bixby or the power menu.</p><p>You can also edit the back button short press, but "Go to previous screen" is too convenient for navigation to lose.</p><p>If you specifically have the Watch 8 Classic, you can edit the third Quick button; it defaults to Samsung Health exercises but can open your stopwatch, flashlight, water lock, camera controller, or voice recorder instead. You can also edit whether it triggers with a short or double press, though unfortunately, you can't choose a shortcut for <em>each</em>, only one.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Bw5PuKrSSJzU7MvfSrsMF6" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-knock-knock-gesture" alt="The Knock Knock gesture screen on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic, worn on the wrist of someone doing the gesture." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Bw5PuKrSSJzU7MvfSrsMF6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Even if you don't edit your shortcuts, you <em>will</em> want to turn on gestures, which are <strong>disabled</strong> by default. The <strong>double pinch</strong> gesture is the most important one: You can answer calls, dismiss alarms and calendar alerts, or pause/restart your music playlist just by double-pinching your fingers.</p><p>From the main watch face, the double-pinch gesture opens the "Now Bar," showing the most important contextual data you need to know. And if you toggle the Secondary action on, a double pinch will take you to your latest notification or next Tile, without having to scroll.</p><p>Its companion is the <strong>Shake gesture</strong>: Twisting your fist up 90 degrees will also dismiss alerts and timers, as well as decline incoming calls or return to the main watch face from a notification. And the <strong>Knock knock gesture</strong> is like the Quick Button: It lets you trigger a specific shortcut, from the flashlight or stopwatch to any one of your favorite apps.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-edit-your-tiles-and-add-new-ones"><span>Edit your Tiles and add new ones</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="o7rPpwAjeMWuGzc5rjP7EE" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-Health-Tile" alt="The Health Tile on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic showing ECG and antioxidant index" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o7rPpwAjeMWuGzc5rjP7EE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Wear OS Tiles have always highlighted info from one specific app or health tool at a time; One UI 8 Watch added new customizable "Multi-Info Tiles" that let you see more information per Tile. By default, Samsung groups your Tiles by Health, Fitness, and Basic, all visible past the main watch face.</p><p>My advice is simple: Customize the Tiles to make them your own. Scroll down to the bottom of any Tile and tap the <strong>+ button</strong>; you'll be shown "Featured" Tile suggestions that fit the theme, followed by a list of all eligible apps with a Tile widget. Some apps have two Tile options: a condensed half-screen widget and a full-screen one.</p><p>For the Health tile, for example, you may want to add the antioxidant index, food calorie tracking, hydration tracking, medication reminders, mood tracking, cycle tracking, or the new Vascular Load widget. You might not want a <em>full</em> Tile dedicated to each, but now that they scroll down in one category, you're more likely to want to check them all at once.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="DLCGjr9DFQ9njdP3sthmNE" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-Tile-size-options" alt="The "Add Tile" view on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic showing two sizes of Antioxidant Index widget." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DLCGjr9DFQ9njdP3sthmNE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You can also create a new Tile with whichever theme you think is appropriate; I created a Morning Tile with my alarms and reminders, for example.</p><p>So far, unfortunately, only Samsung apps work with the multi-info tiles; Google and third-party apps still take up a full Tile slot each. To add those, keep scrolling right past your current Tiles and tap the <strong>Add tiles</strong> button. If you don't see a specific Tile, make sure you have the app downloaded on your Galaxy Watch 8 from the Play Store; not all apps have Tiles, however.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-add-new-and-custom-watch-faces"><span>Add new and custom watch faces</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="rYv9C2pjuga7tmMarSxZW5" name="Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-Facer-Spongebob" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic resting on a blanket showing a custom Facer watch face of Spongebob Squarepants." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rYv9C2pjuga7tmMarSxZW5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung makes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/wear-os/we-weighed-galaxy-vs-pixel-watch-for-best-wear-os-watch-faces">best watch faces on Wear OS</a>, with dozens of styles and hundreds of variations available. The simplest way to change your watch face is to <strong>tap-and-hold the main face</strong> to find your favorites, or swipe right and tap <strong>Add watch face</strong> to look through the available options. You can also <strong>customize</strong> to change the background image, style, color, indexes, and complications of a given watch.</p><p>I've always found customizing on-watch to be really finicky, so I recommend using the mobile Galaxy Wearable app, where you can see more options at once, including tons of "Premade" styles with varied colors and backgrounds.</p><p>Tap <strong>Watch faces</strong> in-app, and you can scroll through every option by category, or tap "Discover more watch faces" at the bottom to search by color, style, and specific data. I recommend saving ten faces or so on the watch, so you can quick-swap based on your mood.</p><p>Wear OS 6 also reintroduced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/wear-os/facer-officially-returns-to-the-galaxy-watch-8-in-massive-update">third-party watch face apps like Facer</a>, so you can add custom or branded faces like the SpongeBob face above. Each app gets one face slot on your watch, so you'll need to buy and choose faces in-app; they'll then automatically appear on your Galaxy Watch 8.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-limit-notifications"><span>Limit notifications</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="y9hSpMZYU9Fdc9ujfFZzV6" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-Gmail-notifications" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic showing Gmail notifications above a keyboard." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y9hSpMZYU9Fdc9ujfFZzV6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of the main perks of a Wear OS watch is actionable notifications, but it's also about sparing yourself from checking on every pocket buzz. You should make sure you only see the important stuff and save the rest for later.</p><p>In the <strong>Galaxy Wearable</strong> mobile app, tap <strong>Watch settings > Notifications > App notifications</strong>. Take a couple minutes to toggle off all the apps that you don't think are important to see. Then back up and decide whether to use <strong>Smart device selection</strong> — which limits watch notifications while your phone is active — or <strong>always show on both</strong> to be sure you don't miss anything.</p><p>In <strong>Advanced settings</strong>, anyone with bad eyesight can choose <strong>Read notifications aloud</strong> if they wish, while I personally toggle <strong>Turn on screen when notifications received</strong> for a visual signal to go with the vibration.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-start-testing-out-gemini"><span>Start testing out Gemini</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="NPceH7NH6uy5qSLcgB6EsM" name="Gemini-on-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic" alt="The Gemini app on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic, which lays on a black marble table next to plant leaves and an Android mascot figurine." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NPceH7NH6uy5qSLcgB6EsM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Now that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-tested-new-gemini-wear-os-app-on-galaxy-watch-8-improvements-and-problems">Gemini has rolled out to Wear OS</a>, you should take full advantage of it. It has better integration with Google and Samsung apps than Assistant did, plus the ability to search or use multiple apps with a single query. It's also prone to mistakes, to be fair, but it's not as limited as Assistant was.</p><p>Go to <strong>Settings > Google > Digital Assistant</strong> and toggle on the "Hey Google" wake word, or else follow the instructions above to make Gemini the long-press shortcut on the Home button.</p><p>By default, Gemini uses the same voice option chosen on your phone. To change it, go to the <strong>mobile Gemini app</strong>, tap your <strong>profile pic</strong>, then <strong>Settings > Gemini's voice</strong>. There are currently ten voices available to choose from, and it'll sync to your watch instantly.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="hneykTF6dBRcXqpuyjFdTE" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-Gemini-Tile" alt="The Gemini widget on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hneykTF6dBRcXqpuyjFdTE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As you start to ask Gemini questions, keep an eye on your display. The first time that an answer requires your <strong>location data</strong>, you'll have to give it permission. And Gemini will make you choose a <strong>default app</strong> for certain categories if Google and Samsung both have one, like Calendar or Messages.</p><p>Finally, you may want to create a <strong>Gemini Tile</strong> using the steps above. This is mainly if you want to create a consistent Gemini action, such as turning on/ off the smart lights in your home, to save yourself from having to ask every time.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-aod-and-screen-timeout"><span>AOD and screen timeout</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="hYpvMH6qr3aCU7PUmPoTSG" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-watch-ultra-2-hands-on-15" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic sitting on a pedestal, showing a watch face in AOD mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hYpvMH6qr3aCU7PUmPoTSG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Galaxy Watch 8 is estimated to last 30 hours with AOD or 40 hours without. I've found the Watch 8 Classic easily outperforms that estimate with AOD as the default, but if battery life is your main concern, go to <strong>Settings > Display</strong> and toggle Always-On Display off.</p><p>You can also use a gesture to only show the display when you turn your wrist toward your face, which is a commonly used middle ground between AOD and tapping the display. To enable this, go to <strong>Settings > Display > Screen wake-up</strong>, then toggle on <strong>Raise wrist to wake</strong>.</p><p>Since battery life isn't a concern for me, I instead leave AOD on and change the <strong>Screen timeout</strong> and <strong>Show last app</strong> times.</p><p>By default, the Watch 8 times out after 15 seconds; five seconds after that, it forgets what you were looking at. I recommend extending these times to 30–60 seconds for the timeout and two minutes to still reopen to the last app or menu, so you can look away to check something on your phone, come back, and still see the relevant data.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-wear-your-galaxy-watch-8-to-bed"><span>Wear your Galaxy Watch 8 to bed</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="uP94fuCpgBZysLzuBaycD8" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-energy-score-and-sleep-score" alt="Close-up of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic showing the Health tile with the user's Energy Score (64 / Fair) and Sleep score (79 / Good)." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uP94fuCpgBZysLzuBaycD8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smartwatch-vs-smart-ring-sleep-tracking">don't like wearing smartwatches to bed</a>, but plenty of Galaxy Watch owners don't mind the feeling. Unfortunately for me, a ton of Samsung Health data will only be available <em>if</em> you wear the Galaxy Watch 8 every night consistently.</p><p>From just one night of sleep, Samsung will give you an Energy Score, Sleep Score, blood oxygen levels and breathing rate, skin temperature, resting heart rate, and heart rate variability. It's a wide range of data meant to quantify whether you're sleeping healthily enough to stay at your best.</p><p>If you enable <strong>Sleep apnea detection</strong> in the <strong>Samsung Health Monitor app</strong>, Samsung will alert you after two days of sleep tracking if it sees signs of "moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea. It's not diagnostically accurate, but it gives you a reason to speak to a doctor if the signs are there.</p><p>After three nights of sleep, Samsung will generate a <strong>Vascular Load</strong> score. It judges whether your heart is under stress, whether from workouts or lifestyle impacts like sodium intake or blood pressure, and tells you whenever your load is higher than normal.</p><p>Samsung will also be able to judge your "sleep pressure" and circadian rhythm after three days to suggest an "optimal bedtime" that "maximizes alertness the next day." After a full week of sleep data, it'll start "coaching" you, giving you a sleep animal related to the type of sleeper you are and pushing you to form healthier bedtime habits.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-change-your-diet-with-antioxidant-index"><span>Change your diet with antioxidant index</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="YRvC6D2xKjaddmtpwBw3TE" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-antioxidant-index-vegetables" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic sitting on a plate surrounded by bell peppers and carrots, the display showing the Antioxidant widget with a "Low" score." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YRvC6D2xKjaddmtpwBw3TE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of the main Galaxy Watch 8 headliner features is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-tested-samsung-galaxy-watch-8-antioxidant-index-and-raised-score">antioxidant index</a>, which measures your thumb for carotenoids, aka the antioxidant pigments in fruits and vegetables that give them their vibrant red, orange, and yellow coloring, and give <em>you</em> a healthy way to counterbalance the effects of aging and stress on your body.</p><p>Once you add the antioxidant index to your Health tile, measuring it is easy; you simply tap the widget, then <strong>Measure</strong>, then <strong>Ok</strong> under "Start measuring." Before pressing okay, take your watch off and press your thumb firmly against the rear sensors.

The Galaxy Z Flip 7 in particular gained two bigger displays, a larger battery, and a slimmer form factor. Understandably, that got fans of clamshell foldables excited.</p><p>After a week of using the Galaxy Z Flip 7, I'm here to temper your expectations somewhat. While the expanded cover screen is a visual masterpiece, its software experience actually takes a step backward. In my testing, the extra battery capacity doesn't translate to longer runtimes, perhaps due to the switch to an Exynos processor.</p><p>Some upgrades are as good or better than advertised, but once I realized the Galaxy Z Flip 7 won't reinvent the cover screen or significantly improve performance and battery life, I came to love it.

To gauge how well both the phone and the network performed, I ran around the Phoenix metro, testing my 5G speeds as I went.

Thus, the Galaxy Z Flip 7 may be the most powerful <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phone</a> for AI in North America, even without Snapdragon.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-battery-life"><span>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7: Battery life</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TKxa5kTNPN4Fj8awJgdBGP" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-7-Review-17" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 closed on its side." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TKxa5kTNPN4Fj8awJgdBGP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>Samsung added a larger 4,300mAh battery to the Galaxy Z Flip 7 this year. </strong></li><li><strong>Battery life will be similar to the Galaxy Z Flip 6 on average, possibly due to the Galaxy Z Flip 7's Exynos 2500 processor drawing more power. </strong></li></ul><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Versus</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-vs-motorola-razr-ultra-2025" target="_blank"><strong>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 vs. Motorola Razr Ultra 2025</strong></a><strong></strong></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-vs-galaxy-z-flip-6" target="_blank"><strong>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 vs. Galaxy Z Flip 6</strong></a><strong></strong></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-vs-galaxy-z-flip-5" target="_blank"><strong>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 vs. Galaxy Z Flip 5</strong></a><strong></strong></p></div></div><p>Battery life on the Galaxy Z Flip 7 has been good, but not great.

The alleged pricing suggests the company's Pixel 10 Pro Fold will push into the $2,000 sector, which reminds us of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>. According to the publication, Google's 2nd-gen foldable will supposedly offer a 256GB, 512GB, and a new 1TB option for $1,799, $1,919, and $2,149, respectively.</p><p>The first two pricing (and storage) numbers aren't anything new; the original Pro Fold was priced similarly. However, if the rumors are true, then the 1TB option could really push consumers over the $2,000 mark. Although you can say the 512GB did the same thing when it first launched, since, you know, taxes exist, but I digress.</p><p>Out of the fold and into the slab, rumors claim the Pixel 10 Pro XL will see its starting line moved slightly. The post claims this device will drop its 128GB option entirely, meaning its 256GB will take over at $1,199, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">like in 2024</a>. Prices then supposedly rise to $1,319 and $1,549 for its 512GB and 1TB.</p><p>The publication then dips into the Pixel 10 Pro, stating it could see the following prices:</p><ul><li>128GB: $999</li><li>256GB: $1,099</li><li>512GB: $1,219</li><li>1TB: $1,449</li></ul><h2 id="the-story-thus-far-2">The story thus far</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1888px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:50.95%;"><img id="Dsi9zdTHMnQZ7rfvdtbLF5" name="google-pixel-10-official-teaser" alt="A teaser render for the Pixel 10, courtesy of Google's official store." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Dsi9zdTHMnQZ7rfvdtbLF5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1888" height="962" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The base Pixel 10 will allegedly remain similar to its 9 series counterpart at $799 and $899 for its 128GB and 256GB variations.</p><p>The rumors put forth by the publication seem to contradict a previous rumor about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/new-pixel-10-colors-have-been-leaked-bringing-some-unexpected-storage-treats">Pixel 10 series' storage configurations</a>. The mix-up only regards the Pixel 10 Pro XL series and the potential dismissal of its 128GB option. Earlier this month, it was suggested that the device would retain the lower-end storage option; however, it might only be available for its Obsidian version. That color choice would grab 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB, leaving the other colors with 256GB and 512GB.</p><p>There's a chance this <em>could </em>change how we're seeing its pricing, at least, on its lower side, but we'll have to wait and see.</p><p>A more recent leak today (July 30) claims Google's Pixel 10 series <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10-leak-shows-signs-of-magnetic-qi2-charging-finally-arriving">could natively support</a> the WPC's Qi2 wireless charging magnets. While other devices, like Samsung's Galaxy S25 phones, require a case with the magnets (meaning the phones are only Qi2 Ready), Google's Pixel 10 could take that extra step, becoming the first Android devices in the U.S. to fully support Qi2.</p><p>Rumors will likely continue for a little while longer until <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-store-pixel-10-teaser-officially-series-design-launch-promo">Google's official event</a>, slated for August 20.</p> ]]></dc:content>

MMS stands for multimedia messaging service, which is a lengthy term for messages containing images, GIFs, and more. In the publication's test, it notes that while MMS in T-Satellite could help it "stand out" from others, there are some things users should be aware of.</p><p>The post highlights problems users may run into when attempting to send images, videos, and GIFs. Regarding photos, those seem to be sent within a two-minute timespan, per their test. Videos, which are typically larger files, took roughly 10 to 20 minutes to send. PCMag details how staggering this was for a couple of five-second clips.</p><p>If someone on a stable cellular network or otherwise is attempting to send you an MMS text, it will "take some time to download" over T-Mobile's T-Satellite network.</p><p>Other media received over the T-Satellite system doesn't take as long, but the publication states is it will still "take some time to download." It's also worth keeping in mind that MMS messages, like regular texts, will require users to remain in clear view of the sky to avoid any further disruptions and delays.</p><h2 id="t-satellite-keeps-you-involved-2">T-Satellite keeps you involved</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="v75XjLy2f7tk5Wkzy5JKq9" name="T-Mobile-spacex-starlink-above-beyond.jpg" alt="T-Mobile and SpaceX team up for Coverage Above & Beyond" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v75XjLy2f7tk5Wkzy5JKq9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: SpaceX)</span></figcaption></figure><p>T-Mobile and Starlink have been down this satellite connectivity path for a while now, which started steamrolling <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/fcc-approves-t-mobile-and-starlinks-direct-to-cell-service">after the FCC gave the go-ahead</a>. This snowballed earlier this year in January when T-Mobile started rolling out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/t-mobile-customers-direct-to-cell-beta-registration">its satellite texting beta</a>.

The announcement highlighted a positive testing period, with over 1.8 million users joining in, even some from AT&T and Verizon networks. T-Mobile has clearly explained everything interested customers <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.t-mobile.com/coverage/satellite-phone-service">need to know about joining</a>, but there are some more details. The T-Satellite service is reportedly included in the T-Mobile Experience Beyond plan "at no extra cost."</p><p>However, all other customers, even those from AT&T and Verizon, must adhere to the $10 additional monthly fee.</p><p>This initial announcement mentioned what PCMag has started noticing this week: the arrival of MMS capabilities. While T-Satellite launched with SMS (regular texts) for Android and iOS, MMS was lined up to join at a later date, which we're now seeing at the end of July. Keep in mind, T-Mobile states there's more to come as a "data-based service" is set to go live on October 1.</p> ]]></dc:content>

During a recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/live/TqQ6E23OSr8?si=GqAW_45GofsERTuy">livestream</a>, AYANEO CEO Arthur Zhang revealed the specs that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/the-ayaneo-pocket-ds-is-the-worlds-first-dual-screen-android-handheld">Pocket DS</a> will have once released.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1929px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="gsZyNLgqshgngcG2RHDsuj" name="AYANEO Pocket DS Specs" alt="AYANEO Pocket DS Specs" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gsZyNLgqshgngcG2RHDsuj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1929" height="1085" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYANEO)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What makes the Pocket DS stand out the most is obviously the clamshell form factor. However, unlike the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/heres-why-im-getting-the-retroid-pocket-flip-2-and-the-pocket-classic">Retroid Pocket Flip 2</a>, the Pocket DS actually has both a top and bottom screen, giving it a distinct advantage for DS and 3DS emulation.</p><p>Both screens sport a 1080p resolution, but the main 7-inch display is an OLED panel with a variable refresh rate up to 165Hz. Meanwhile, the 5-inch lower screen is your standard LCD panel and lacks faster refresh rates beyond 60Hz.</p><p>That's not to say that the bottom screen should be ignored, as the 4:3 aspect ratio makes it perfect for a lot of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/these-are-the-5-retro-gaming-handheld-deals-you-need-and-2-you-dont-before-prime-day-is-over">retro gaming</a>. AYANEO has also implemented a few tricks in the software to enhance the versatility, such as being able to use a "three-finger swipe" gesture to swap what's shown between the top and bottom screens.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Fzg3HW5H88fMgmPn7NBmTE" name="ayaneo-pocket-ds-black-and-yellow-sharing-session-1" alt="AYANEO Pocket DS promo render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Fzg3HW5H88fMgmPn7NBmTE.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYANEO)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2304px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="g4jczqS662VfnDDjZRaCNE" name="ayaneo-pocket-ds-black-and-yellow-promo-renders" alt="AYANEO Pocket DS promo render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/g4jczqS662VfnDDjZRaCNE.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2304" height="1296" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYANEO)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JbZJgJ7S3mUevUMstVvYRE" name="ayaneo-pocket-ds-promo-render-2" alt="AYANEO Pocket DS promo render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JbZJgJ7S3mUevUMstVvYRE.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYANEO)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Pretty much everything about the Pocket DS looks incredible, including the 8,000mAh battery and ergonomic design. However, I was a bit surprised to see that AYANEO opted to implement the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/snapdragon-g-series-chips">Snapdragon G3x Gen 2</a>, as opposed to the G3 Gen 3.</p><p>The former was announced in late 2023, before debuting in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocket-s-review">AYANEO Pocket S</a> in early 2024. Meanwhile, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/gdc-2025-brings-about-new-qualcomm-chips-and-android-gaming-handhelds">Snapdragon G3 Gen 3</a> was introduced earlier this year at GDC 2025, with the Pocket S2 and Pocket S2 Pro being the first two devices to utilize the chip.</p><p>The logical conclusion I could come up with is that the Pocket DS was already deep into development before the G3 Gen 3 was announced. As such, the company likely decided to "stay the current course," instead of making any potential changes to accommodate a new SoC.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="s44iabCTauJg3cm4aR4uPi" name="ayaneo-pocket-ds-second-screen-software-features" alt="AYANEO Pocket DS second screen software features" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/s44iabCTauJg3cm4aR4uPi.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYANEO)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Unb9Ctp57AgExoUzLyb9Ri" name="ayaneo-pocket-ds-performance-explainer-banner" alt="AYANEO Pocket DS performance overview" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Unb9Ctp57AgExoUzLyb9Ri.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYANEO)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>If that's the case, it would give AYANEO the flexibility to confirm that the Pocket DS is already in mass production. Usually, when a new AYANEO handheld is announced, it's at least a few months before it's actually released.</p><p>The decision to use the G3x Gen 2 might pay off in more ways than one, as we suspect (or hope) that the Pocket DS won't be too expensive. For reference, the Snapdragon G3 Gen 3-powered Pocket S2 starts at $499, with the S2 Pro coming in at $619.</p><p>Nevertheless, we'll be paying close attention to see exactly what AYANEO has planned for the price. There's already a sign-up page for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/pocket-ds-world-s-1st-dual-screen-android-handheld/coming_soon">Indiegogo campaign</a>, so you can be notified once it's live.

The Tensor G5 chipset, which the Pixel 10 series is expected to debut, is once again confirmed by the leak.</p><p>The leak also reconfirms that the baseline Pixel 10 will include a triple-camera setup featuring a 48MP primary sensor, a 13MP ultra-wide lens, and, for the first time, a telephoto lens with up to 20x Super Res Zoom. Meanwhile, the Pixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL will retain their telephoto sensors but offer an upgraded "Pro Res Zoom" capability of up to 100x.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1275px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:64.39%;"><img id="MMjBc85Fui37azvpDwp9sG" name="pixel-10-magsafe-charging-leak" alt="Leaked image of Pixel 10 showcasing Pixesnap MagSafe-like wireless charging" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MMjBc85Fui37azvpDwp9sG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1275" height="821" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Evan Blass / X)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What's more interesting, though, is that one of the leaked posts shows a magnetic charger attached directly to the back of a Pixel 10 device without a case, suggesting that the Pixel 10 series could be the first flagship Android phones to support MagSafe-like Qi2 magnetic charging natively.</p><p>Initial rumors of the Pixel 10 supporting a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10-to-allegedly-get-qi2-magnetic-pixelsnap-accessories" target="_blank">“Pixelsnap”</a> Qi2 wireless charging system surfaced in June 2025. At that time, it was believed the system would work only with compatible cases — similar to how it functions on the Galaxy S25 Ultra and OnePlus 13. However, this new leak suggests the Pixel 10 may have built-in magnets, offering the Qi2 experience out of the box.</p><h2 id="pixel-buds-pro-2-and-pixel-watch-4-join-the-party-2">Pixel Buds Pro 2 and Pixel Watch 4 join the party</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">pic.twitter.com/oJv38zaVFL<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1950291439570583746">July 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>Blass also shared renders of other upcoming Google Pixel devices expected to launch alongside the Pixel 10 series. These include the Pixel Watch 4, an official case for the Pixel 10 Pro, and a new color option for the Pixel Buds Pro 2. The new products are shown in Moonstone and Iris colorways, with the Pixel Watch 4 also appearing in Obsidian.</p><p>The Pixel Watch 4 is rumored to come in 41mm and 45mm sizes, featuring a larger battery than the Pixel Watch 3 and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/google-pixel-watch-4-leaked-charging-cable-dock-rumor">side-mounted charging system</a>. It’s also expected to bring major software upgrades, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/the-pixel-watch-4-would-be-my-go-to-fitness-smartwatch-if-google-added-this-feature">particularly for strength training</a> features.</p><p>Of course, nothing is official until launch, but from the leaks so far, it looks like the Pixel 10 series is addressing many of the gaps left by the Pixel 9 lineup. Thankfully, we don’t have to wait too long, as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-release-date">official unveiling</a> is just a few weeks away.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The company says users will find everything they need to do whatever they need with their cryptocurrency straight from the app. With Samsung Pay, users can now purchase crypto right from their Galaxy device.</p><p>All of your payment information will carry over from purchase to purchase, so long as your Samsung Pay account remains connected.</p><p>Coinbase states this new payment integration is designed to unlock "a smoother path to crypto for millions of mobile users across North America." While Samsung Pay in Coinbase is rolling out in the U.S. and Canada, the post states this "gradual" rollout will meet "select" users throughout August.</p><p>By this, not everyone will likely see availability simultaneously; however, Coinbase says it's working on that for an update "in the near future."</p><h2 id="samsung-pay-s-tlc-continues-2">Samsung Pay's TLC continues</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:984px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.49%;"><img id="3ndVGeZqmpjV3tGaYzhMfX" name="samsung-coinbase-crypto-announcement" alt="Samsung Pay integrates with Coinbase, bringing easy tap to pay crypto transactions for users." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3ndVGeZqmpjV3tGaYzhMfX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="984" height="546" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Coinbase)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Those involved with cryptocurrency should keep their eyes peeled for future updates from Coinbase and Samsung Pay over the next month or so.</p><p>While we await those developments, Samsung Pay has rolled out its "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsungs-tap-to-transfer-is-finally-landing-on-us-galaxy-phones-this-month">Tap to transfer</a>" feature for Galaxy devices. Debuting with the Galaxy S25 series, Samsung brought this easy money transfer system to more of its phones in the U.S. All it takes is for users to bump their phone against their friend's or family member's phone to complete the transfer. While Tap to Transfer works with a variety of third-party digital wallets, you don't necessarily need one.</p><p>So long as the person you're trying to send money to has a physical debit card that's tap-to-pay ready, the feature will piggyback off its chip to complete the transfer. Additionally, you can send money to a friend from a distance if you've got their phone number handy.</p><p>Most recently, Samsung started rolling out the ability for users to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-wallet-now-lets-you-split-in-store-payments-into-installments">pay for items in installments</a> via the Wallet app. If you have an eligible Visa and Mastercard account, you can pay for chunky store payments in more comfortable, bite-sized pieces. The company states that when you're going to pay through Samsung Wallet, you should begin noticing a "Pay in installments" option. From there, you can pick the plan that works for you.</p> ]]></dc:content>

A new deep dive into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/one-ui-8-beta-3-rolls-out-for-galaxy-s25-and-galaxy-watches-see-their-first-beta">One UI 8's</a> build suggests that it could be giving up on the standard Galaxy S26 for a new Galaxy S26 Pro (as first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/exclusive-samsung-galaxy-s26-series-branding-shakeup-3581900/">Android Authority</a>).</p><p>This comes after rumors that Samsung could also replace the Plus variant with the all-new Edge, with some tweaks, hinting that the Korean OEM might be switching things up in a huge way. The website seems to have stumbled upon evidence for this line-up rebranding in the One UI 8 build, and the product codenames seemed to have indicated that there may not be a base or, as they say, vanilla variant for the Galaxy S26 series next year.</p><p>"Instead, Samsung’s upcoming flagship series appears to consist of three models: Galaxy S26 Pro, Galaxy S26 Edge, and Galaxy S26 Ultra," the website stated.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ApYiq3sZAK4vi732wpRbgM" name="Codenames-Galaxy-S26-series" alt="Galaxy S26 series shuffle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ApYiq3sZAK4vi732wpRbgM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Sharing screenshots of the product names, the website stated that their findings in the firmware contradict previous leaks where the series' codename started with NP (New Paradigm).  Instead, the build labels the three alleged devices of the Galaxy S26 series as M1, M2, and M3, which could match up to be the Galaxy S26 Pro, S26 Edge, and S26 Ultra (without the standard and plus models).</p><p>Breaking things down further, the website states that, in previous lineups, the number “1” represented the base model; however, now “M1” is being used to refer to the new Pro variant.</p><p>Back in May, we reported that Samsung could be ditching the Plus model for the new Galaxy Edge, but that was only dependent on how the new model faired in the market, and as we now know, Samsung is reportedly struggling to sell the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-hands-on">Galaxy S25 Edge</a>.

But these are still just rumors, and what the company does with its new flagship lineup remains a mystery.</p><p>That said, leaks have been popping up about the new Galaxy S26 series. It is expected to feature the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-2">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite 2</a> processor, and Samsung is also reportedly testing its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-s26-might-rock-the-exynos-2600-chip-but-only-in-this-region">Exynos 2600 chip.</a> It could show up with One UI 8.5 and Android 16 out of the box, bolstered with Galaxy AI.

Overall, the analytics firm states Q2 2025 saw an 11% YoY (year over year) decline in smartphone shipments to 13.3 billion units. However, the highlight this time around is Google, as research shows the company's Pixel series has carried it into the top five this past quarter, placing it in fourth place.</p><p>Compared to the same time last year, Google's Pixel grew in the U.S., shipping 0.8 million units across the country. This brings Google into owning 3% of the market share for Q2. Overall (and speaking annually), Canalys states Google's Pixel has grown 13% in the U.S. market.</p><p>While Google has grown in the U.S. phone market share, it's still behind the likes of Apple, Samsung, and Motorola. Samsung reportedly shipped 8.3 million units in Q2 this year, amassing a whopping 38% annual growth with its Galaxy phones. Canalys researchers say this is "primarily driven" by its budget series, the Galaxy A line.</p><p>Motorola only saw a modest 2% growth in the U.S. while Apple saw an 11% dip.</p><h2 id="will-google-look-for-more-2">Will Google look for more?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="o8Fi9zLSCe2rep8yKdQKuN" name="pixel-9-pro-fold-pixel-9-side-by-side-1.jpg" alt="Pixel 9 Pro Fold next to Pixel 9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o8Fi9zLSCe2rep8yKdQKuN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Canalys highlights several issues that could hinder other OEMs in the U.S., such as "new requirements to local operations, uncertain tariff policies, and pressured demand."

Do you want magnets? Should it be a clear case? What level of drop-proofing would you like? Are there enough colorways available? Answer these questions before diving into the selection process. Once you've figured out whether you like minimalist or maximalist designs and where you stand on the thickness and impact resistance, you'll be ready to pick.</p><p>Believe it or not, but the first-party Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE / Flip 6 Silicone Case is a fantastic choice for your Flip 7 FE. You're guaranteed to get a perfect fit and top-notch quality. A year has passed since the case first launched, so the price has also dropped considerably. And as another bonus, you can choose from the bright springy colors of the Flip 6 series to liven up your dull <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/what-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-fe-color-should-you-buy">black or white Flip 7 FE</a>. The ring protruding from the spine of this soft matte case gives you s comfortable grip on the folded Flip 7 FE. It's a handy little silicone case overall.</p><p>Thin cases are always in demand. If you're one of those who prefer extremely thin cases, then you should look at the Thinborne Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE and Galaxy Z Flip 6 Case. This robust case has a really powerful magnetic ring baked into the back, yet it somehow measures only 0.04 inches wide. It's also incredibly lightweight, adds impact absorption, and comes with a cover display screen protector made of shatter-proof tempered glass. The only caveat here is the price, but I believe the high-quality make of the case more than makes up for it.</p><p>Once your Flip 7 FE's all decked out in the snazziest of cases, be sure to grab a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/best-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-fe-screen-protectors">decent screen protector for it</a> too. Very few cases come with screen protectors, so it's best you purchase a kit separately.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Outside of this, Google is also introducing a new version, called "Veo 3 Fast." This Veo model is a little more lightweight for users looking to complete "work that requires rapid iteration and speed."</p><p>Veo 3 Fast is reportedly adept at generating and testing variations of a company's advertisements "quickly." This model can also create "video demonstrations" for your products based on the images you've provided. Additionally, Google states Veo Fast can create "engaging animated explainers" and even training material for new recruits.</p><p>The company speaks about Veo 3 Fast in the same vein as it does <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-releases-gemini-2-5-flash-with-hybrid-reasoning-and-boasts-faster-speeds">Gemini 2.5 Flash</a>. Veo 3 Fast, while being lightweight, has reportedly struck a balance between fast processing times and strong visual quality output.</p><h2 id="google-s-veo-series-goes-further-2">Google's Veo series goes further</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DIUsf8X2DUY" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Google's Veo 3 Fast model is available in Vertex AI alongside the larger Veo 3 model. The post highlights some ways users can enjoy both AI video generators, such as more storytelling. In Vertex AI, users can set the scene, alongside any audio they'd like to include, all in a single prompt. If you have your characters speaking, Google says what you'd like them to say will be lip-synced, as well as any other background sounds you'd like to include.</p><p>On a related note, Veo 3 features native dialogue generation, which helps businesses "connect with an international audience." While Veo 3 and Veo 3 Fast generate your video once, it will "localize the dialogue for dozens of languages."</p><p>All videos generated arrive in 1080p, giving users a little more confidence in their quality before showing it off.</p><p>Regarding that Veo 3 teaser, Google says that both models will receive an image-to-video generation feature in Vertex AI in August. We've seen this arrive a couple of times already through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-photo-to-video-animates-images-veo-3-model-rollout">an update for Gemini</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-creative-photo-to-video-remix-rollout">another for Google Photos</a>, both of which rolled out in July. Now, Veo 3 and Veo 3 Fast will have this feature available for users to experiment with, granting them an eight-second video clip based on the photo you've provided.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This is because the Flip 7 FE is basically a re-released version of the last-gen foldable, with a few minor changes made to the insides.</p><p>Most smartphone accessory brands seem to have added the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on">Flip 7 FE</a>'s name next to pre-existing screen protectors for the Flip 6. This is understandable, considering both phones share the same displays — a 3.4-inch cover display and a 6.7-inch internal foldable display.

However,  only 469 high-level “Take Action” warnings were sent out before the first 7.8 magnitude quake.</p><p>It appears that Google's system miscalculated the tremors and sent a lower-level warning to 500,000 people, which is designed for "light shaking" and does not alert users with the same urgency. Initially, Google told the BBC that, "We are confident that this system fired and sent alerts," without providing a clear estimate of how many people were warned before the first earthquake.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:40.65%;"><img id="4grFRmBhi4xhUZoGoPhbBG" name="android-earthquake-alerts-system.gif" alt="Android Earthquake Alerts System" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4grFRmBhi4xhUZoGoPhbBG.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="813" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>However, now the tech giant has made some clarifications and agreed to the fact that the alert system failed in 2023, and it needed to be fine-tuned to respond to such catastrophic events.

This means that the alert system's predictions are becoming more accurate and closer to the actual magnitude of the earthquake. Furthermore, when Turkey was hit with a magnitude 6.2 earthquake in April 2025, the first alert was issued 8.0 seconds after the earthquake began.</p><p>"People who experienced moderate to strong shaking had a warning time of a few to 20 seconds.

Whether you’re cramming for exams, organizing a research project, or just trying to make sense of that dense PDF your professor uploaded, these new features might just save your sanity.</p><p>Google announced in a blog post that you can now ask about images directly, whether it's a diagram or slide for which you need a quick explanation. AI Mode <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-search-call-around-agentic-gemini-2-5-pro-ai-mode-update">on mobile already does this</a>, and it’s finally landing on desktop too.</p><p>Furthermore, PDF uploads are on the way, so you’ll soon be able to drop in lecture notes or papers and ask questions on the spot.</p><h2 id="need-help-with-tough-topics-2">Need help with tough topics?</h2><p>Take a tricky psychology concept, for example. You can drop in a slide, and AI Mode will break it down for you, adding helpful context pulled from the web. You’ll get straight answers with links if you want to dive deeper. Google Drive support is also on the horizon, so grabbing files from your cloud stash will be easy.</p><p>Google is also adding something new to AI Mode called Canvas. Think of it as a side panel built to help you lay out messy information, whether you're planning study sessions, group projects, or even a trip.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VqzL4eSC6PxUhGRgNJAdrg" name="Google-AI-Mode" alt="New Canvas feature in Google Search" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqzL4eSC6PxUhGRgNJAdrg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2096" height="1179" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You can also build and tweak your plans on the fly, pull in stuff from your files, and pick up right where you left off later.

It’s kind of like turning your phone into a live tutor. Just point your camera at something confusing, and Search will instantly respond with helpful information. It’s powered by Google Lens and tech from Project Astra.</p><p>To try it out, open Google Lens, tap the Live icon, and ask away. For now, it’s only on mobile and limited to users in the Labs experiment in the U.S.</p><p>Finally, Google Chrome is getting a new way to invoke Lens on the desktop with “Ask Google about this page.” Just clicking it from the address bar while viewing a website or PDF launches AI Overviews, giving you more insights on the page in question.

There were some great accessories on the market, but smartphone hardware wasn't ready yet.</p><p>That officially changed in 2025, when Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite mobile platform became truly capable for gaming and Wi-Fi 7 brought Ethernet-like speeds to Android phones.

There's no obnoxious RGB here — just a sleek design available in white or black colorways. You get subtle Razer branding on the top of the headband and on the ear caps, which are swappable and customizable. I tried the white one, but think the black version is slightly more low-key.</p><p>The advantage of this kind of style is that you can wear the BlackShark V3 Pro out and about without looking too strange. The headset's boom mic slots into the 3.5mm headphone jack and is detachable. When removed, the BlackShark V3 Pro can go undercover, blending in with all the other over-ear headphones out there.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8Jju7bG7QLnwS8sxgv28S4" name="Razer-BlackShark-V3-Pro-4" alt="The Razer BlackShark V3 Pro gaming headset laid atop records showing the leather headband." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8Jju7bG7QLnwS8sxgv28S4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Going back to the premium feel, the stitching on the leather headband looks and feels nice. The ear cushions are made of memory foam and are lined with a cloth cover, which is very comfortable. A leather or faux leather ear cushion might look more premium, but I think cloth makes more sense here, as it'll hold up better against sweat and will be easier to clean.</p><p>Rather than adjusting the fit of the BlackShark V3 Pro via the headband, you do it with a metal wire connecting to the ear cap and audio assembly. Once you get the hang of it, this feels easier and more natural than the typical adjustment methods.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RitDtRFxnV7enWKb2GMGZ4" name="Razer-BlackShark-V3-Pro-5" alt="The Razer BlackShark V3 Pro gaming headset laid atop records showing the metal adjustment slider." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RitDtRFxnV7enWKb2GMGZ4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Comfort is a big reason why I think you may be able to use BlackShark V3 Pro as your main pair of wireless headphones. They feel great to wear and the memory foam helps comfort even during long listening or gaming sessions. It's not <em>that</em> bulky, at least for a gaming headset.</p><p>The BlackShark V3 Pro weighs 367 grams, and that's less than the 385-gram <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/i-pitted-the-airpods-max-against-my-usd3000-audio-setup">AirPods Max</a>, which are my baseline for comparing heavy headphones.

When you dive into the specs, it doesn't end up being all that surprising. Razer is using custom 50mm drivers with bio-cellulose diaphragms and larger magnets. That leads to big sound, better frequency separation, and improved sound imaging.</p><p>In other words, the BlackShark V3 Pro has the audio tech inside to produce great sound, whether you're gaming or listening to music. For gaming, these components make it easier to tell where an enemy is coming from, or hear a chest nearby. While listening to music, the benefits translate to creating a wide soundstage with a spatial feel.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="w9JobVZ2bAQRfarTEh27L5" name="Razer-BlackShark-V3-Pro-7" alt="The Razer BlackShark V3 Pro gaming headset laid atop records showing the customizable ear caps." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/w9JobVZ2bAQRfarTEh27L5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Active noise-canceling isn't going to beat headphones from Apple, Sony, and Bose, but it is more than serviceable on the BlackShark V3 Pro. I was able to cancel out planes flying over my balcony while using the BlackShark V3 Pro at half volume, which is all I really need. If you're trying to block out someone watching TV in the next room while you're gaming, this headset has you covered.</p><p>Ambient mode leaves a bit more to be desired. It lets in plenty of sound when the volume is low or there's no audio coming from your device. However, while gaming or listening to music, it's somewhat hard to hear the people around you even with ambient mode enabled. To be fair, ambient or transparency modes typically sound like this until you get into the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-noise-canceling-headphones">ultra-premium sector of ANC earbuds and headphones</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ukXFfqp9Ca6QX8oQHnbNLC" name="Razer-BlackShark-V3-Pro-11" alt="The Razer Audio app showing BlackShark V3 Pro in the device list." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ukXFfqp9Ca6QX8oQHnbNLC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One thing I love about the BlackShark V3 Pro is how versatile the headset is for connectivity. You can connect the headset to your device wirelessly via Bluetooth, wired via USB or 3.5mm, or using a 2.4GHz receiver. Additionally, the BlackShark V3 Pro features dual connection with Bluetooth and 2.4GHz simultaneously. That means you can be gaming on your PC or console while streaming music from your phone and hear it all through the headset.</p><p>Best of all, the 3.5mm jack works in analog mode, meaning you can use it without powering on the headset.

We don't yet know when Samsung's next flagship tablets will actually arrive, but what if I told you there was an insane deal on a previous Galaxy Tab model?</p><p>The Galaxy Tab S9 might be almost two years old, but it's still the last flagship Android tablet from Samsung at this size.

And that was even before seeing that you could save up to $500 when trading in an old device and ordering from Samsung. </p><p>Price check: <a href="https://amazon.com/dp/B0C4BC6R95" target="_blank">$589 at Amazon</a> | <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-11-128gb-wi-fi-with-s-pen-graphite/6546661.p?skuId=6546661" target="_blank">$599 at Best Buy</a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/tablets/galaxy-tab-s9/buy/galaxy-tab-s9-128gb-beige-wi-fi-sm-x710nzeaxar/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="f1383038-4812-4843-babd-c9e399237134" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$799.99" data-dimension48="$799.99" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p>✅ <strong>Recommended if:</strong> you want a powerful Galaxy Tab in a smaller form factor; you prefer Samsung devices but aren't a fan of the move to MediaTek; you don't care that the Tab S9 is almost two years old, because it's still going to get a few more major OS updates.</p><p>❌ <strong>Skip this deal if:</strong> you want the latest and most powerful Android tablet; you're concerned about Samsung's commitment to providing updates moving forward; you want a tablet that can pull double-duty as a laptop.</p><p>The more I think about the reasons why someone should pick up the Galaxy Tab S9, the more I'm surprised. Samsung ditched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/hey-samsung-wheres-the-galaxy-tab-s10">11-inch Galaxy Tab S10</a>, and while some rumors suggest it's making a return with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/galaxy-tab-s11-series-launch-shortly-samsung-exec-comment-report">Tab S11</a>, there's no guarantee of that yet. On top of that, the move to MediaTek was a surprising one considering Samsung's long-standing partnership with Qualcomm.</p><p>Although the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review">MediaTek chip</a> enables more power for on-device AI, those who are like me and enjoy retro emulation won't have the best time. However, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 in the Galaxy Tab S9 is the current "gold standard" for emulation, as there's excellent community support, and it's the SoC that many of the best emulators are tailored towards.</p><p>Besides that, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9">Galaxy Tab S9</a> is just a great all around tablet anyways, with its 11-inch OLED panel, all-day battery, expandable storage, and a plethora of case options. Plus, you'll get an S Pen in the box, adding another layer of intrigue, as you won't need to spend more money just to get one.</p> ]]></dc:content>

If this holds up, it’ll be the fastest charging speed ever on a Galaxy flagship, and finally, something to match the pace set by rivals in China.</p><h2 id="same-battery-new-muscle-2">Same battery, new muscle</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:524px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:164.12%;"><img id="V74EiKF4wmPwimfrH9Nmmb" name="Galaxy-S26-Ultra-render" alt="leaked render of the Galaxy S26 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V74EiKF4wmPwimfrH9Nmmb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="524" height="860" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: PhoneArt / X)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That said, the Galaxy S26 Ultra is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-ultra-may-disappoint-on-battery-and-charging-speeds">likely sticking with a 5,000mAh battery</a>. Under the hood, it’s expected to run on Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 8 Elite 2, though Samsung is also said to be testing its own Exynos 2600 as a possible option.</p><p>Even with all the potential upgrades inside, the outside is staying familiar. The S26 Ultra is tipped to keep the same sharp corners, flat edges, and bold quad-camera layout on the back.</p><p>Furthermore, the tipster says the S26 Ultra’s screen is getting an upgrade with new anti-reflective glass and something called CoE depolarizer tech. Not much is known about the CoE part yet, but the glass should cut glare and make the screen look brighter and sharper, especially in bright light.</p><h2 id="camera-tweaks-not-a-revolution-2">Camera tweaks, not a revolution</h2><p>For the cameras, the S26 Ultra is said to use Samsung’s newer ISOCELL HP2 (2026) sensor with a larger aperture for better light capture.

Samsung is sticking to what works while finally adding some long-requested upgrades, like faster charging. With a launch expected in early 2026, more details should keep trickling out in the coming months.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This option was key for installing custom ROMs, and its removal, as per an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://xdaforums.com/t/bootloader-unlocking-option-removed-from-one-ui-8-0.4751904/#post-90208099" target="_blank">XDA Forum post</a>, points to Samsung tightening its stance on device modding (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sammyguru.com/breaking-samsung-removes-bootloader-unlocking-with-one-ui-8/" target="_blank">SammyGuru</a>).</p><p>Samsung used to limit bootloader unlocking to U.S. models, but that restriction seems to be going worldwide with One UI 8. According to the XDA Forum post, the OEM Unlocking option is missing on international Galaxy devices too, hinting that bootloader access might now be fully blocked across the board.</p><p>Digging into the bootloader configuration, the post author found a new line: androidboot.other.locked=1. This flag directly hides the “OEM Unlock” toggle in settings. When it’s set to 1, the option disappears, blocking users from even starting the bootloader unlock process.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4534px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="iyhNwQFDYkgxESLWkv3E3T" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review-20" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iyhNwQFDYkgxESLWkv3E3T.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4534" height="2550" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="no-more-u-s-only-lock-2">No more U.S.-only lock</h2><p>That line, which was once limited to U.S. models, has now shown up in One UI 8 builds for non-U.S. regions too, signaling that Samsung’s bootloader lock is no longer region-specific but likely a global rule.</p><p>Several Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Flip 7 owners, outside the U.S. included, have confirmed that the “OEM Unlocking” toggle is gone, as noted by SammyGuru.</p><p>Samsung’s stable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/how-install-one-ui-beta">One UI 8</a> release also looks set to lock down recent flagships by removing the bootloader unlock option, effectively cutting off any shot at custom ROMs or kernel work on newer Galaxy flagships.</p><p>For Android power users and developers, this change hits hard. Unlocking the bootloader is the gateway to all kinds of deep-level tweaks, like custom ROMs, custom kernels for better performance or battery life, and root access for full control way beyond what stock software allows.</p><p>Most regular users probably won’t even notice this change, seeing as very few ever touch developer settings, let alone need an unlocked bootloader.</p> ]]></dc:content>

But it trades away the weeks-long battery life that Garmin power users are accustomed to, and many of its upgraded features will be overkill for the typical Venu crowd.</p><div ><table><caption>Garmin Venu X1 vs. Venu 3 specs</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Garmin Venu X1</p></th><th  ><p>Garmin Venu 3</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>41 x 46 x 7.9mm, 40g with nylon strap</p></td><td  ><p><strong>3: </strong>45 x 45 x 12mm, 47g with silicone strap</p><p><strong>3S: </strong>41 x 41 x 12mm, 40g with silicone strap</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Materials</p></td><td  ><p>Fiber-reinforced polymer with titanium caseback</p></td><td  ><p>Fiber-reinforced polymer with stainless steel bezel</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Buttons</p></td><td  ><p>2</p></td><td  ><p>3</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Protection</p></td><td  ><p>5 ATM, sapphire crystal</p></td><td  ><p>5 ATM, Gorilla Glass 3</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>2-inch (448 x 486) diagonal, 2,000 nits</p></td><td  ><p>1.4-inch (454 x 454) or 1.2-inch (390 x 390) diameter, 1,000 nits</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery life (Smartwatch)</p></td><td  ><p>8 days; 2 w/ AOD</p></td><td  ><p><strong>3: </strong>14 days; 5 w/ AOD</p><p><strong>3S: </strong>10 days; 5 w/ AOD</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery life (GPS)</p></td><td  ><p><strong>GPS: </strong>16 hours</p><p><strong>All-systems GNSS: </strong>14 hours</p><p><strong>All-systems GNSS w/ music: </strong>7 hours</p></td><td  ><p><strong>GPS: </strong>26 (3) or 21 (3S) hours</p><p><strong>All-systems GNSS: </strong>20 (3) or 15 (3S) hours</p><p><strong>All-systems GNSS w/ music:</strong> 11 (3) or 8 (3S) hours</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Tracking</p></td><td  ><p>GPS, GLONASS, GALILEO, BeiDou, QZSS</p></td><td  ><p>GPS, GLONASS, GALILEO</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>32GB (Maps, music)</p></td><td  ><p>8GB (Music)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Sensors</p></td><td  ><p>Elevate v5 HRM, SpO2, accelerometer, altimeter, compass, gyroscope, skin temperature</p></td><td  ><p>Elevate v5 HRM, SpO2, accelerometer, altimeter, compass, gyroscope, ECG, skin temperature</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Bluetooth, ANT+, Wi-Fi, NFC</p></td><td  ><p>Bluetooth, ANT+, Wi-Fi, NFC</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Flashlight</p></td><td  ><p>✔️</p></td><td  ><p>❌</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Mic & speaker</p></td><td  ><p>✔️</p></td><td  ><p>✔️</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h2 id="garmin-venu-x1-vs-venu-3-design-and-display-2">Garmin Venu X1 vs. Venu 3: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="PDXSzw9KFA8xDA2TAMqPuS" name="Garmin-Venu-3-muscle-map.jpeg" alt="A muscle map for side lunges on the Garmin Venu 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PDXSzw9KFA8xDA2TAMqPuS.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Garmin Venu lineup targets "mainstream" audiences. Its designs prioritize lightweight style, with fewer buttons and AMOLED displays (before that became the norm for Garmin). The Venu 3 fits that mold, measuring 1–2mm skinnier than most Garmins and masking its polymer body with an attractive steel bezel.</p><p>The Venu X1, on the other hand, very clearly emulates the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> squircle look, except with an incredibly skinny frame that leaves little room for a typical Garmin battery. It's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-x1-bizarre-premium-watch-stuck-between-two-worlds">incredibly comfortable to wear</a>, but the design will turn off Garmin fans who dislike Apple Watches on principle.</p><p>The 2-inch Venu X1 and the 1.2-inch Venu 3S weigh the same, which is the crux of the X1's appeal: a weight you can barely feel paired with a ton of visual data, while the 3S has to squeeze things in.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="JkGxMwiEzRuX98JNARL35C" name="Garmin-Venu-X1-side-view-buttons" alt="A side angle of the Garmin Venu X1 on the author's wrist, the photo angled to show the two side buttons." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JkGxMwiEzRuX98JNARL35C.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Part of the weight difference comes from the X1's lighter nylon strap, but it's actually quite comfortable (except for being hard to take off of larger wrists), whereas I complained that the Venu 3's default silicone band wasn't breathable enough in my review.</p><p>My biggest complaint with the X1 design is that it only has two buttons. Venu watches generally depend on touchscreen controls, but at least the Venu 3 has a third button for two shortcuts. Otherwise, the X1 doesn't have the Up / Down buttons that Garmin power users like, or the crown that Apple fans might like. It's just as swipe-dependent as the Venu 3.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2932px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="ZHDti2VKtVPX9eoiofcppB" name="Garmin-Venu-X1-display" alt="Top-down view of the Garmin Venu X1 with the Snapshot watch face showing multiple data points like stress, VO2 Max, and heart rate." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZHDti2VKtVPX9eoiofcppB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2932" height="1649" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The 1.4-inch Garmin Venu 3 display is actually quite good, on par with the much pricier <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Fenix 8</a> in resolution and brightness.

We believe this comes down to design: Garmin uses a metal bezel wired to the sensor's electrodes, and the Venu X1 only has titanium on the caseback.

It's much more useful than the display-based flashlight on the Venu 3, but it will burn through your battery quickly if you use it too often. It's decently bright for something up close, but not the best fit for nighttime workouts.</p><p>Both models have a built-in mic and speaker for Bluetooth calling and passthrough commands to your connected Android phone's assistant or iPhone's Siri. New to the table is the X1's Voice Command tool for on-watch functions like "Start a run" or "Show my training status."</p><p>Unfortunately, Voice Command tends to be fairly buggy and limited, a trait it shares on the Fenix 8 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-970-review">Forerunner 970</a>. Hopefully, Garmin will make it smarter over time.

In the photos above, you can see how the X1's square display gives you much more context for your surroundings and room for more text and buttons; the more expensive Fenix 8 naturally cuts off visual data, so you have to zoom out more to see what's nearby, and any text is disruptive.</p><p>It's one of my favorite features on the Venu X1, but it's also fair to say I don't get a chance to use it often, and I rarely follow courses on-watch.

Millions use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-google-chrome-tips-and-tricks">Google Chrome's</a> Incognito Mode, likely thinking it makes them more anonymous or offers safer browsing. <strong>It does neither.</strong></p><p>The quick and dirty answer is that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-make-your-chrome-searches-invisible-incognito-mode">Incognito Mode</a> does nothing except prevent the web browser from caching files, images, and history on the local device; use Incognito on your phone, and nothing gets saved to your phone unless you download it yourself. The same goes for any computer or a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebook</a>.</p><p>That leaves a lot of things untouched and happening the same way they would if you weren't using it. Here's what's up.</p><h2 id="you-re-not-hiding-from-anyone-2">You're not hiding from anyone</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bEic4b9p7Xmk23mme8wACL" name="Incognito-Mode-New-Chrome-Disclaimer.jpg" alt="The disclaimer for Google Chrome's incognito mode." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bEic4b9p7Xmk23mme8wACL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When you open an Incognito Mode instance of Chrome, it does a good job explaining what's going on. Most people will never read all that, and some who do won't quite understand it. There was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-tracking-private-incognito-browsing-lawsuit-proceeding">a whole lawsuit about this</a>, which Google lost. I think they shouldn't have because this landing page covers it all.</p><p>Here's what it says:</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Chrome won't save:</strong></p></th><th  ></th><th  ><p>Your activity might still be visible to:</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Your browsing history</p></td><td  ></td><td  ><p>Websites you visit.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Cookies and site data.</p></td><td  ></td><td  ><p>Your employer or school.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Information entered on forms.</p></td><td  ></td><td  ><p>Your internet service provider.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p><strong>Third-party cookies are blocked</strong></p><p>When you're in Incognito mode, sites can't use third-party cookies. If a site that relies on these cookies isn't working, you can try giving that site temporary access to third-party cookies.</p><p>Firstly, ignore the third-party cookies bit. Never give any website access to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-plans-banish-third-party-cookies-forever">third-party cookies</a>, even on a temporary basis, if you're bothering to use Incognito Mode.</p><p>The "<strong>Chrome won't save</strong>" section is really self-explanatory. Chrome is an app that regularly saves its data to your device, and while using Incognito Mode, it won't save any of that. This data can be useful to make web browsing faster by saving a local copy of things you see from places you visit a lot. Cached data is not a bad thing when used the right way.</p><p>The "<strong>Your activity might still be visible to</strong>" part is more confusing and, in my opinion, incomplete. It might as well just say "everything else." When you're online, you're sending and receiving information, and without that information, it won't work. That goes for Incognito Mode, too.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1395px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="4Vni7Q7Bee3kDi6g3yJqL8" name="mobile-tracking.jpg" alt="Google logo with magnifying glass in the background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4Vni7Q7Bee3kDi6g3yJqL8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1395" height="785" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Every step in that chain of service providers still needs that information if you're going to reach the place you wanted to reach. Your local network (or your school or workplace if you're browsing through either), the internet service provider who supplies data services, the website itself, any authentication providers like Verisign, and any other business needed to connect you to your destination.</p><p>It also means Google. Metrics about what websites are visited, the performance of Chrome on a particular site, and the way the server responds are important data to Google because they help make Chrome more reliable. The thing to remember is that since you're not signed in to your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-set-new-google-account">Google account</a> in Incognito Mode, none of this is associated with you directly. Ancillary data can still be used to make that connection, though, like your IP address or if you signed into anything.</p><p>I would also suggest you take a look at things again, because I can't replicate this. Using the same website with Incognito Mode, I see no prompt asking me to log in with my Google Account. I do see the same message using "Private Window" via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/latest-mozilla-firefox-update-so-important-even-department-homeland-security-says-you-should-upgrade">Firefox</a>, but not in Chrome.</p><p>In either case, I wouldn't advise you to do it.</p><h2 id="how-to-stop-all-this-2">How to stop all this</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6357px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="z5B7TsyuGdnvaQgJAJHaGm" name="vpn-search-bar-how-to-pick_16x9.jpg" alt="VPN Search Bar" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/z5B7TsyuGdnvaQgJAJHaGm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6357" height="3576" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Shutterstock)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I wish I could say the same thing you'll read a million times and tell you a VPN will keep you anonymous. But I can't because it won't. There's really not much you can do to make sure that nobody is tracking anything you do while online.</p><p>I sat and thought for a while, and the best I could come up with was some crazy scheme using a Linux live distribution, and forcing a change of your local IP before and after. That still wouldn't be foolproof, but it would be a big pain in the butt just so you can look at naked and sweaty people.</p><p>I can tell you what I do, though. I use Google Chrome for work, for shopping, paying my bills, and banking. Any other time, I use an alternative that doesn't come from Google.</p><p>I like Firefox and use it on my computers (you can load Firefox for Android right on your Chromebook!) and on my phone. On the desktop, Firefox comes with a built-in privacy mode, but on the phone, you can install <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.focus" target="_blank">Firefox Focus</a> for the same experience.</p><p>I can't say Firefox is any better than any other browser; it's just what I've used for years and years. You should check out the others, and there are plenty. Stay away from Edge, Safari, and Amazon Silk if you don't want big tech involved, though.</p><p>Long story short — you can't be online and be completely anonymous. The old saying that "nothing is really free" applies and that website you visit as well as the tools you use to get there do whatever they can to use data to make money.</p><p>Most of this is anonymized in some way, but it's still able to be tied back to you if someone tries hard enough and has access to it all.</p><p>Most importantly, nobody at Google or your ISP cares if you visit Pornhub. Just be yourself, but still try to follow the rules at work or school.</p> ]]></dc:content>

As a tracker, the Charge 6 helps users work out, walk, and more, and its newest update aims to "improve connectivity" for fitness equipment. Fitbit states it is expanding compatibility between the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-charge-6-vs-5">Charge 6</a> and exercise machines.</p><p>What this expanded connectivity brings is the ability for users to view their heart rate in real-time on their equipment's display. If you've never done this or are simply curious, there's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14236705?hl=en&sjid=8957065572703293314-NC#zippy=%2Cwhat-fitness-equipment-or-apps-are-compatible-with-pixel-watch-or-charge">a support document</a> with those details. Per Fitbit, the Charge 6 is compatible with Peloton bikes, treads, and rows, as well as iFit (NordicTrack), Concept2, Tonal, and Strava, just to name a few.</p><p>To help your Charge 6 when you're working out, Fitbit detailed three new watch faces that are designed to provide "more comprehensive" data when glancing. New faces like Axira and Geometric are a bit simpler and artistic, offering quick bite-sized pieces of health data, like your heart rate or steps.</p><h2 id="fitbit-refinements-2">Fitbit Refinements</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:907px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:35.61%;"><img id="PiebojUvH5k27kqJ9sg7CF" name="fitbit-charge-6-update-momentum-axira-watch-faces" alt="Fitbit's latest update brings new watch faces to the Charge 6 for more "comprehensive" data at a glance." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PiebojUvH5k27kqJ9sg7CF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="907" height="323" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Fitbit)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The new Momentum watch face displays the current time, as well as an entire log of your current health analytics. Users will find their heart rate, steps, distance traveled, calories burned, and Active Zone Minutes.</p><p>Fitbit's blog post mentions that there are also a few "general" bug fixes headed for the Charge 6, too. The company also has a few undisclosed fixes rolling out for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-inspire-3-launch">Inspire 3</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-versa-4-review">Versa 4</a>, and Sense 2 in today's update.</p><p>The Charge 6 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-light-qol-update-charge-6-trackers-watches-patch">picked up a small update</a> earlier this year that was essentially like house cleaning for the device. The device grabbed a much-needed Bluetooth security upgrade, as well as new "status indicators." These indicators regarded your device's state (DND or otherwise) and its battery, among a few more.</p><p>On a more exciting note, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit/fitbit-labs-gemini-lab-reports-symptom-checker-detailed">Fitbit Labs had an update</a> a couple of months ago that brought Gemini-powered lab report summaries. Under the "Medical Record Navigator," users can ask Gemini to help them understand those complicated reports with a little more ease. Additionally, that experimental update introduced "Symptom Checker." With this, users can describe what they're feeling to the app (and its AI) to receive some suggested actions to help them get on track again.</p><ul><li><strong>Fitness tracker deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/searchpage.jsp?st=fitness+tracker&_dyncharset=UTF-8&_dynSessConf=&id=pcat17071&type=page&sc=Global&cp=1&nrp=&sp=&qp=&list=n&af=true&iht=y&usc=All+Categories&ks=960&keys=keys"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/search?q=fitness+tracker"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=fitness+tracker&crid=1QI27KW7ITF2W&sprefix=fitness+tracker%2Caps%2C160&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/search/fitness%20tracker"><u><strong>Dell</strong></u></a></li></ul>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="96198515-497b-4a57-9100-8a45677c9531">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yyHYMQWe6GrbSprU5NA3kU.jpg' alt="Fitbit Charge 6"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Fitbit Charge 6</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The Fitbit Charge 6 keeps design cues you'll recognize from the Charge 5.

Sign up for AT&T's fiber internet and you'll get a prepaid Visa card worth up to $150 within 3-4 weeks. You can also bundle your internet plan with AT&T wireless service to score some additional savings.

To receive the full $150, you&apos;ll need to sign up for the 1 Gig plan, which will set you back $80 every month.</p><p>That may be a bit pricey compared to some home internet options, but AT&T&apos;s fiber internet makes up for the cost by providing reliably fast connection speeds that are more than sufficient for all of your browsing, gaming, and streaming needs. You can also score some major savings by bundling the home internet with one of AT&T&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cell-phone-plans">wireless plans</a>. </p><p>There&apos;s even an offer that could land you <strong>six free months</strong> of AT&T fiber internet when you bundle with a postpaid plan and grab a phone at the same time.

There's just something about the idea of having both a phone and tablet with me wherever I go that makes me swoon. That being said, I do understand the appeal of flip phones, like the Galaxy Z Flip 7 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Moto Razr Ultra</a>.</p><p>However, I have to admit that with the two aforementioned flip phones, I would be lying if I said that I wasn't at least considering one. Until recently, the last time that I had spent any meaningful time with a flip phone was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x-flip-review">Vivo X Flip</a>, and before that, it was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review">Galaxy Z Flip 3</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="iE8D9A2J8cFmakMoaMvq96" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on-10" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iE8D9A2J8cFmakMoaMvq96.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Leading up to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/biggest-announcements-from-samsungs-summer-unpacked-galaxy-z-fold-7-flip-7-and-more">Galaxy Unpacked</a>, I've been messing around with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> off and on, trying to see if a flip phone would supplant a foldable for me. Unlike some of my counterparts here at Android Central, I don't think that's in the cards for the near future. But I did happen to find one particular use case that keeps drawing me in.</p><p>Growing up, my handheld gaming experience was limited to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-game-boy-game-boy-advance-emulators-android">Game Boy Color</a>, which ended up getting lost while on a family vacation. After that, I had a brief stint with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-turn-your-galaxy-z-fold-3-nintendo-ds">Nintendo DS</a> before moving on to the PSP and then the PS Vita. That's to say that I never messed around with a Game Boy Advance or the SP variant.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="rWTtwj2cD2w63NxeLjaw4j" name="anbernic-rg34xxsp-gba-sp-anbernic-rg35xxsp-2" alt="Anbernic RG34XXSP next to RG35XXSP with Game Boy Advance SP and Miyoo Flip in background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rWTtwj2cD2w63NxeLjaw4j.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>And that's where the idea of a flip phone comes, as I've entrenched myself in the world of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">gaming handhelds</a>. Last year, Anbernic released the RG35XXSP, and the Miyoo Flip arrived right around the end of December. In 2025, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/i-cant-stop-playing-games-with-this-clamshell-retro-handheld">even more clamshells</a> have been added to my collection, with the Retroid Pocket Flip 2, Anbernic RG34XXSP, and, more recently, Powkiddy V90S arriving on my doorstep.</p><p>If you can't tell by now, I have a bit of an affinity for clamshell handhelds at the moment. With the exception of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/heres-why-im-getting-the-retroid-pocket-flip-2-and-the-pocket-classic">Pocket Flip 2</a>, the others are all custom Linux-based devices, which is great for the early days of consoles, but not so much with anything more modern. So while I was using the Flip 6, it dawned on me to see if I could replace all of those with a clamshell that was much more powerful.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5111px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wBEfYL4WZfYDZFpcs2SBB5" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-gba-sp-3" alt="Galaxy Z Flip 6 with RG34XXSP and Game Boy Advance SP" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wBEfYL4WZfYDZFpcs2SBB5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5111" height="2875" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The obvious benefit to a clamshell is that it's more compact, as you can just slide it in and out of your pocket with ease. Not only that, but there's less of a chance of messing up the screen as you just close it when you're done using it. I know this wasn't always the case with flip phones, but the hinge technology has vastly improved to the point that it's not really too much of a concern for most.</p><p>And while there are customization options with those Linux handhelds, your options are fairly limited when compared to Android, even with custom firmware options. With that in mind, I set out to try and turn the Galaxy Z Flip 6 into an ultimate Game Boy Advance SP.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5216px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tphwQjh8PbCzmKgQUuBhi5" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-gba-sp-5" alt="Galaxy Z Flip 6 with RG34XXSP and Game Boy Advance SP" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tphwQjh8PbCzmKgQUuBhi5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5216" height="2934" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It all starts with finding the right emulator, and thankfully, there is no shortage of those on Android. For Game Boy Advance alone, these are just <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-game-boy-game-boy-advance-emulators-android">a few of the options</a> available:</p><ul><li>Pizza Boy A</li><li>RetroArch</li><li>My Boy!</li><li>GBA.emu</li></ul><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5190px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="HGmPW9EP3zuW3osyqaDXZ5" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-gba-sp-1" alt="RetroArch on Galaxy Z Flip 6 Cover Screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HGmPW9EP3zuW3osyqaDXZ5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5190" height="2919" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While there are a few more, I really only stick to two, swapping back and forth between Pizza Boy A and RetroArch. You might be wondering why, and the answer's pretty straightforward — Pizza Boy on the main screen, RetroArch on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-set-up-and-use-apps-on-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-cover-screen">Cover Screen</a>. I've even gone so far as to set RetroArch as my default "lock screen" shortcut for when the Flip 6 is closed.</p><p>And the fun doesn't stop there, as you can actually apply various skins from Pizza Boy, making the Flip 6 look even more like a Game Boy Advance SP. With a lot of research, a little bit of time, and a smidge of patience, I've practically turned the Z Flip 6 into the ultimate gaming clamshell.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5239px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iRGEQeAQqbmMxSrXCj85Z5" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-gba-sp-6" alt="Mobapad controllers attached to 3D Printed mount for Galaxy Z Flip 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iRGEQeAQqbmMxSrXCj85Z5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5239" height="2947" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, there is just <em>one</em> problem with this setup — touchscreen controls are awful. If it's anything more than playing a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-premium-android-games">puzzle game</a>, Balatro, or for testing emulators, I usually won't actually play games using the touchscreen. Instead, I had to get a bit creative, as there aren't too many solutions. Thankfully, I have a 3D printer, so it was just a matter of finding something similar to what I had in mind.</p><p>After finding the print, less than an hour later, I could ditch the touchscreen controls. Admittedly, this isn't the perfect solution, as I'd prefer something that would use capacitive buttons to interact with the screen, thus providing something more portable. That might be something I explore down the line, but it wasn't really necessary at the time.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4183px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GmwZZ3noEhLQwrkiwCUPZ4" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-gba-sp-7" alt="Mobapad controllers attached to 3D Printed mount for Galaxy Z Flip 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GmwZZ3noEhLQwrkiwCUPZ4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4183" height="2353" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With this 3D print, I just slot the Z Flip 6 in and attach a set of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/forget-using-s-pen-use-nintendo-switch-joy-con-your-remote-shutter">Joy Cons</a>. Or, if you have third-party Joy Cons that support <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-game-controllers-android">Bluetooth</a>, those would work just fine too. No matter what you end up with, it's still going to be more enjoyable than tapping on the screen.</p><p>Once the dust had settled a bit on this project, I found myself rather torn, but ultimately decided to stick with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Fold 7</a> as my main phone. That said, with the Flip 7 now available, I've been keeping a close watch on deals for either the Galaxy Z Flip 6 or one of the latest Moto Razr phones. If I play my cards right, there's a decent chance I'll end up making a more permanent decision, even if it means teaching myself how to create 3D prints and adding yet another phone to my daily carry.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="4023c48e-c6be-48ac-a21a-67079713b235">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XmBWLC226YN7B33SJ2PbJi.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Just because the Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Flip SE have been released doesn't mean you should sleep on the Galaxy Z Flip 6.

This update is rolling out for U.S.-based users first today. Users will find its new AI-powered Store Reviews when clicking the "site information" icon on the far left of the address bar in Chrome. Google states users will find "data from Google Shopping and other popular review websites."</p><p>The AI will pull this data to (ideally) provide users with "insightful" information about a store when shopping online.</p><p>The short menu that appears will inform you that it is showing you an "AI-generated summary" based on reviews sourced from Trust Pilot, ScamAdvisor, Google, and more. The "What customers say" box is a combination of what people have said on these sites, which will likely involve a mix of the good and the bad. Google states this "description box" will try and throw in other useful tidbits, like shipping experiences, pricing, and "product quality," per previous customers.</p><p>Additionally, Store Reviews in Chrome will detail the overall rating of the store based on data pulled from a wide swath of websites. Users can also directly view these customer reviews themselves to get a clearer picture of the situation.</p><h2 id="shopping-with-google-2">Shopping with Google</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:808px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:74.26%;"><img id="4WPLQmQqXS66VKxCkUDZjR" name="google-chrome-store-reviews-ai-generated" alt="Google Chrome is receiving its "Store Reviews" update, which brings an AI-generated summary of a store's performance from customers, sourced from several places." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4WPLQmQqXS66VKxCkUDZjR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="808" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While this update is likely headed for Google Chrome on PC, the post didn't state whether or not users on Android should expect this, too.

When you buy a flagship Samsung Galaxy device, you get exclusive Galaxy AI features, fine-tuned multimodal Gemini support, and even more Google AI features.</p><p>Considering that Galaxy AI does a few things better than any other phone maker, Samsung users have an edge that those rocking the other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> don't. One UI 7 brought some great AI tools to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Samsung Galaxy S25 series</a> earlier this year, and now, One UI 8 is doing the same for brand-new Samsung foldables.</p><p>I've spent the last few days testing the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 in and out, and came up with five AI features I actually found myself wanting to use. Some are new and some are old, but you should be aware of every single one of them if you're buying a new Galaxy Z Flip 7 or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>. In fact, many of them are available on Samsung Galaxy phones at large.</p><h2 id="gemini-live-2">Gemini Live</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="u28xZkcRGouPrAr3dwym8Z" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-7-AI-Features-1" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 using various Galaxy AI features." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/u28xZkcRGouPrAr3dwym8Z.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Flip phones didn't have the best support for multimodal Gemini Live before Samsung released the Galaxy Z Flip 7. You couldn't use screen sharing or live video streaming features on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>, and while you <em>could</em> do it on Motorola Razr phones, the experience was quite terrible. With little optimizations and buttons hidden behind the camera lenses, it's tricky to even start a live video session on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-review">Motorola Razr 2025</a> cover screen.</p><p>Meanwhile, the new Galaxy Z Flip 7 supports a version of Gemini Live that's fully optimized for the cover screen. You can't use screen sharing for obvious reasons — the 4.1-inch cover screen is too small for it to be useful — but live video sharing is perfect. After testing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/how-use-gemini-live-camera-screen-sharing">multimodal Gemini Live</a> on phones from every major Android brand, this implementation of it might be my favorite yet.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4CpynvwwhLRpCAqoaaW9bS" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-7-vs-Flip-6-Cover-Screen-7" alt="The cover screen experience on the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 compared to the Galaxy Z Flip 6." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4CpynvwwhLRpCAqoaaW9bS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Being able to clutch the small flip phone in your hand while talking with Gemini Live is nice, and the form factor helps ensure you always have a comfortable grip. It's easier to just hold your arm outward to show Gemini Live what you're looking at, and flip the phone around to show yourself or listen to a response when needed. You could also prop the Galaxy Z Flip 7 up in tent mode while working with your hands.</p><p>The versatility of using Gemini Live on a flip phone makes it better than using a slab phone in my book, which are heavy and cumbersome to wield while doing other things. If we're talking about flip phones specifically, no other model has optimized <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> quite like the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7.</p><h2 id="ai-select-2">AI Select</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ttEohSPs7CZMQhBUTwpucY" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-7-AI-Features-2" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 using various Galaxy AI features." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ttEohSPs7CZMQhBUTwpucY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>AI Select might be the most underrated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI feature</a>. You'll find it in the Edge Panel — swipe from the top-third of the screen to open it. After that, AI Select will be the first option from the top. You can use it to select basically anything on your screen with artificial intelligence, and get quick access to context-based options.</p><p>For example, you tap an image on your screen to download just that photo to your device without having to manually crop out the rest of your screen. Or, if you're looking at a flyer, you can use AI Select to automatically add the event to your calendar. Other options include selecting text, creating GIFs, translating languages, or generating something new with Generative edit and Drawing assist.</p><p>Actions that would be tedious on an average smartphone, such as creating a GIF from any video on your screen, are made simple. It's like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>, but instead of searching the web, you can tap into all the Galaxy AI features on your device.</p><h2 id="object-eraser-2">Object Eraser</h2><p>Almost every phone offers a generative edit and object removal tool, but in my testing, Samsung's Object Eraser is the most impressive. Apple's Clean Up and Google's Magic Editor try to do the same thing, but every time I try using Object Eraser, I'm shocked about how well it uses generative AI to remove something in a photo and fill in the gaps.</p><p>To test <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-use-object-eraser-samsung-phone">Object Eraser</a> on the Galaxy Z Flip 7, I took a photo of myself holding a Galaxy Watch 8 and tried to remove it. This was a particularly tricky situation, as it not only had to fill in the gaps in my hand, but also the striped and textured carpet with various colors in the background.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qc2qKix2onTSvrHbSxo5oG" name="Samsung-Object-Eraser" alt="Removing a Galaxy Watch 8 with the Object Eraser on the Galaxy Z Flip 7." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qc2qKix2onTSvrHbSxo5oG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's a dropoff in sharpness and texture in the parts of the image where Object Eraser used generative fill, but it's hard to tell that at first glance. This extreme example is proof that if you need to remove something in the background of an image, your Galaxy phone is up to the task.</p><p>To try it, open a photo in the Samsung Gallery app, tap the Galaxy AI button in the center of the toolbar, and select or circle anything you want to remove. It's that simple.</p><h2 id="interpreter-2">Interpreter</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sk7DepVLT3JUxA9rx3VSMX" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-7-AI-Features-5" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 using various Galaxy AI features." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sk7DepVLT3JUxA9rx3VSMX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The form factor of a foldable is uniquely positioned to help solve certain problems, and language barriers are one of them. With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai-gets-four-new-languages-support">Interpreter</a> on the Galaxy Z Flip 7, you can use AI to quickly converse with someone who speaks a different language than your own. This feature leverages both screens, and when the Galaxy Z Flip 7 is on a table, both people can see and hear a translation of what the other person is saying.</p><p>This feature isn't new to the Galaxy Z Flip 7, but the bigger Flex Window cover screen definitely makes it more enjoyable to use when sitting across from someone. It's certainly a Galaxy AI feature you should keep in your portfolio. Beyond the cover screen, you can also find Interpreter directly in the call UI for use during phone calls, as well as in the Edge Panel.</p><h2 id="call-assist-2">Call Assist</h2><p>There's one AI feature that I truly can't live without, and that's Call Assist. I use it or a comparable version on every device I test to screen calls and avoid wasting time with robocalls or scammers. Straight from the Call UI, you can trigger Call Assist. From there, you can utilize the Live Translate feature we just covered, or use my favorite option: text call.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vtWBv3sSmXo5DkTv7xDKr9" name="Samsung-Call-Assist-Screenshots" alt="Call Assist on the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vtWBv3sSmXo5DkTv7xDKr9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With text call, Galaxy AI will convert the person's words on the other end of the call to text, and give you the chance to reply — also with text. This is handy when you don't know whether you should pick up, but you also don't want to miss anything important.</p><p>I always use features like Call Assist when I'm expecting an important call from a business or unknown number, and simultaneously don't want to pick up a spam call by mistake. It's already come in handy a few times while using the Galaxy Z Flip 7 as my daily driver.</p><h2 id="plus-many-many-more-2">Plus many, many more</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7hmjEwfmvCjKNXjn6EjUJg" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-7-1" alt="The lock screen on the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7hmjEwfmvCjKNXjn6EjUJg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Those are just a few of the Galaxy AI features I find myself using on the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7, and the good news is, they're on a lot more Galaxy devices too. To close this list out with an honorable mention, Samsung still gives users the option to <strong>only</strong> process their data on device when using Galaxy AI features. When I reviewed the Galaxy S25, I wrote that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/every-android-flagship-should-steal-this-ai-feature-on-the-samsung-galaxy-s25">every Android flagship should copy this toggle</a>, and I'm glad to see it on the Galaxy Z Flip 7 as well.</p><p>Gemini is great, but Samsung phones like the Galaxy Z Flip 7 take things a step further with Galaxy AI features you can only get on Galaxy. Meanwhile, most of Google's best AI features are crossplatform. Not everyone cares about mobile AI, but if you do, there's a case to be made for choosing a Samsung Galaxy phone over the competition.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="336cd74e-f298-4707-b4ab-3ae7762efb6a">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SnVAEkbBa3ziMj85fokzMb.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>A great AI foldable</strong></em></p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 is a foldable that offers the best of both worlds.

Normally written by Android Central Wearables Editor Michael Hicks, this week is a guest post by Android Central Senior Editor Nicholas Sutrich, who has been on a fitness journey since 2020 when he tried CrossFit for the first time.</p></div></div><p>The new Oakley smart glasses from Meta have a lot going for them. Great Oakley HSTN style, unique colors, and even the choice of Oakley's patented <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oakley.com/en-us/lp/lens-technology">PRIZM lenses</a>. But they're specifically a great option for athletes who want to save and share first-person footage of their workouts.</p><p>The Oakley Meta's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oakley-meta-hstn-smart-glasses-battery-life-review">battery life improvements</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oakley-meta-hstn-camera-review">extra camera resolution</a> are great enhancements over Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses. But the real draw for athletes will be the improved image stabilization when recording videos from the glasses.</p><p>I took my Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses out for several runs and to the gym to see how well they hold up during workouts, and was extremely impressed with the stabilization of the video capture, in particular. To see this in action, hit that 23-second mark in the video below and watch as Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses smooth out my run in a way Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses struggle to do.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="2df6e48d-1c22-46ec-bce1-b8542b80c38d">            <a href="https://www.meta.com/ai-glasses/oakley-meta-hstn/" data-model-name="Oakley Meta HSTN" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pRxAtAtsLkG2oTnhntPqgD.jpg' alt="An official product render of Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Oakley Meta HSTN</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Grab a pair of limited edition Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses in warm white with authentic Oakley PRIZM lenses and show the world what you see, all while protecting your eyes.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div><h2 id="smooth-operator-2">Smooth operator</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sBL0acIBb2Y" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Oakley Meta HSTN and Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses can't record your heart rate or give advanced workout stats — although that could happen in future smart glasses from Meta — but they can capture your run in a hands-free way that a smartphone cannot. Better yet, because they're a snug fit, they don't bump or jostle on my face like some pairs of sunglasses can, so they won't get annoying even on long runs.</p><p>While I'm not a marathon runner, I do enjoy running throughout the week to get my heart rate up and push myself to do something out of my comfort zone. Sometimes, it's fun to record these runs and make a little video out of them, if for nothing but my own historical records.</p><p>Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses made <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/running-a-half-marathon-with-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses">Michael's half-marathon</a> look like a super smooth experience, and Meta has further improved the image stabilization on Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses when capturing the action in 1080p. That's great since the default 1080p mode delivers the best battery life <em>and</em> the best stabilization on any camera smart glasses I've tested, a win-win if you ask me.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WDViHafZbarZ5uaefUqcuK" name="oakley-meta-hstn-wearing-while-walking" alt="Walking through a neighborhood while wearing warm white Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WDViHafZbarZ5uaefUqcuK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What particularly impressed me was how the glasses handled stabilization on all kinds of terrain and during all kinds of running activities. Bounding down a hill looked just as smooth as running on a flat sidewalk, and running up stairs two at a time was just as smooth as a light jog.</p><p>But I didn't have the same sentiment when setting the Oakleys to 3K recording resolution, though. In fact, it almost looked like the video wasn't stabilized at all at this resolution. It's clear that Meta is using the higher-resolution camera for better electronic image stabilization when the glasses are in 1080p mode.</p><p>Considering there's barely any visual quality difference between 3K and 1080p on these glasses, I'd say just stick with the default 1080p resolution and reap the benefits of incredible stabilization and longer battery life!</p><h2 id="working-out-with-perks-2">Working out with perks</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="u2Knj9mX8LvpgZWed6QAz4" name="working-out-with-oakley-meta-hstn" alt="Screen captures from videos taken with Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses while working out.

I work out at a CrossFit-style gym, so while we do plenty of running and use cardio machines, we're also lifting barbells, squatting til our legs give out, and generally punishing ourselves for our physical betterment.</p><p>Wearing Oakley Meta HSTNs posed no issues with most exercises I tried, despite their rigor. They don't move at all on my head while running, as I said previously, but I also found they stay snug when doing pull-ups, sit-ups, push-ups, everything I tried with barbells, and everything I tried with kettlebells. I even did handstand push-ups (where my head is facing the ground), and they didn't move an inch.</p><p>The lone area where they faltered was when I tried to do burpees with them. If you've never done a burpee, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/gYiE_2BtSTg">here's a very short video</a> on how to do them. Because of the forward-down-up-hop movement, the Oakleys slowly inched off my face until they fell to the floor after the 6th burpee. I tried the same thing with Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses and didn't have this problem, so the straighter temple arms on the Oakleys make them less usable for this one movement.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yTaAFx8LJNTm6wvcgyrkMo" name="oakley-meta-hstn-vs-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-fisheye-video" alt="Comparing the fisheye effect on Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses video with the more correct video shape on Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yTaAFx8LJNTm6wvcgyrkMo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Above all, though, the biggest problem with using this limited edition PRIZM lens-equipped pair is that they're <em>only</em> sunglasses, unlike my Ray-Ban Meta Smart glasses, which have transition lenses for indoor and outdoor wear.</p><p>The limited-edition frames are available <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/oakley-meta-hstn-glasses-limited-edition-prizm-24k-polarized-lenses-warm-grey/6636582.p">for $499</a>, but additional styles and lenses are coming in the next few weeks for $100 less.

The biggest change in this update is how Android's QR code viewfinder produces its weblink <em>after </em>your scan completes. The publication found that Google has implemented a better sub-menu (bottom of your screen) that shows where the link will take you (i.e., Chrome) with some useful tools.</p><p>Now, users can scan a code and find the following actions: Open (to visit the site/app), Copy text, and Share. This is far more than the old "Open" button, which only let users head to wherever that QR code originated.</p><p>There are some smaller updates, such as Google making the "Scan QR code" label smaller and placing it above the viewfinder's crosshair when identifying a code. There's also a new bottom UI, which places a flash icon beside the scanner's pre-existing "Scan from photo" option. As previously mentioned, the publication reports this update is rolling out today (July 28), but it might take some time since it's through Google Play Services.</p><p>If it doesn't appear within a reasonable amount of time, it's suggested that users restart their devices.</p><h2 id="qr-s-android-adventures-2">QR's Android Adventures</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:264px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:227.27%;"><img id="JkkeXY5sZi4AoyXQyMDnK8" name="google-android-qr-code-scanner-updated-link-actions" alt="Google's new QR code scanner on Android brings even more actions to users after scanning a code and viewing its link." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JkkeXY5sZi4AoyXQyMDnK8.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="264" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:265px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:226.42%;"><img id="csyjHo3xp2hwg79Pc6ZLL8" name="google-android-qr-code-scanner-updated-ui-viewfinder" alt="Android has updated its QR code scanner with a new bottom viewfinder UI with a flash icon, assistance icon, and the pre-existing "scan from photo" option." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/csyjHo3xp2hwg79Pc6ZLL8.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="265" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>QR codes (and scanning) seem like a "set it and forget it" feature, but Android's been updating and bringing more functions to it, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-circle-to-search-is-now-your-barcode-and-qr-code-scanner">like through Circle to Search</a>.

While Acer doesn't include a stylus in the box, the Spin 714 is compatible with the best USI pens.

The consensus of the internet at large is that it's overpriced and will underperform.</p><p>That may be the case; we won't know until people have had it in their hands for a few months. We can take a look at what's being offered and at what price to help decide if it's even worth looking twice.</p><p>A lot of people are saying it's a Flip 6 with a new stock number and price tag, but it's really not. If you already have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-hands-on">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>, there's no way you should consider buying a Flip 7 FE, but they aren't the same phone.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-pros"><span>The pros</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="m2Kcau6uMkxdqAt6SSqgVU" name="Galaxy-ai-is-here.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy AI" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/m2Kcau6uMkxdqAt6SSqgVU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="563" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Flip 7 FE has some good things going for it. It's running the latest Samsung software platform, has a revamped front display, and will see most of the features the full-priced Flip 7 will. Including many of the AI features if that's your jam.</p><p>It also has a Samsung logo on it. That may mean nothing to you, but it does matter. Samsung is known to make quality products and is one of Google's closest partners. People may buy one just to show off the Samsung name, but more realistically, the fact that it comes from Samsung means you can trust that it will last at least as long as it should. Quality can be worth paying for.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-cons"><span>The cons</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3646px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:47.67%;"><img id="paAZUYtQZbwbDN6Bm4wybF" name="exynos-2400.jpg" alt="Samsung Exynos 2400" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/paAZUYtQZbwbDN6Bm4wybF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3646" height="1738" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Now we need to talk about the drawbacks of the Flip 7 FE, and there are two big ones: the processor and the price tag.</p><p>The processor issue in a nutshell — the Flip 7 FE will come with the Samsung Exynos 2400 processor. That's the same processor that was used in many of the Galaxy S24 phones, and it's not nearly as bad as people make it out to be. If you're the kind of person who <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nanoreview.net/en/soc-list/rating" target="_blank">ranks CPUs based on benchmark scores</a>, it's the 15th best processor of all time, besting chips like the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2.</p><p>If you don't care about benchmark numbers, there are still minor concerns with the modem and the battery drain. It does not have as strong a modem as anything from Qualcomm, at least in North America. That means you might not have the best signal for the fastest speeds or clearest calls.</p><p>It's also a bit more power hungry than the competition, and the 4,000mAh battery may not last you the entire day. No amount of software engineering can "fix" this, though they could make it less of a problem. Don't count on it, though.</p><p>Now for the real elephant in the room — the price. A Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE with 128GB of storage and 8GB of memory starts at $899.99. You can upgrade to 256GB of storage for $959.99.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Flip 6 launched at $1,099.99, but it came with a Qualcomm Snapdragon chip and more system memory. You can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Camcorder-Interpreter-Manufacturer/dp/B0D195JKYD?th=1" target="_blank"><strong>buy one brand new at Amazon</strong></a> with 256GB of storage for $899.99 or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Unlocked-Android-Smartphone-Renewed/dp/B0DL7PGY4P" target="_blank"><strong>a factory refurbished model</strong></a><strong> </strong>for $595.</p><p>You could also buy a very similar phone, the Motorola Razr 2025, with 256GB of storage for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Unlocked-Camera-Pantone-Spring/dp/B0F2GD8456/ref=dp_fod_d_sccl_1/145-8150528-5809421?pd_rd_w=wNZt0&content-id=amzn1.sym.9cf17164-13e4-4652-96f9-f76b8f33fec0&pf_rd_p=9cf17164-13e4-4652-96f9-f76b8f33fec0&pf_rd_r=YV9241HBK6T0B3G965ZE&pd_rd_wg=Cv5FL&pd_rd_r=f3cd1fb5-3be9-4deb-a1bf-faad391341e5&pd_rd_i=B0F2GD8456&th=1"><strong>$699.99 at Amazon right now</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>The Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE is not a bargain.</strong></p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-my-verdict"><span>My verdict</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="74oMGswZwasFdLZnxN77vZ" name="Motorola-Razr-Comparison" alt="The Motorola Razr Plus 2023 (left), the Razr 2025 (middle), and the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 (right)." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/74oMGswZwasFdLZnxN77vZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This isn't any type of review or me talking about what I like best. This is purely a look at what's being offered and it's price.</p><p>If you're heavily vested in Samsung's ecosystem of software and devices, you're better off with the "regular" Flip 7 for $1,099.99 because it has everything the FE has to offer, double the storage, 12GB of system memory, and a slightly better chip for $200 more. I know $200 can be a lot of money, but the differences are worth the price bump.</p><p>If you aren't tied to a Samsung phone but want the Flip form-factor, the 2025 Motorola Razr is the better buy all around.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="976683d9-9f00-4474-9545-259767a5f30d">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FbHhKFZhdrMpQBn9V5dZhP.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Not a good bargain</strong></em></p><p>Samsung finally made the cheaper Flip many asked for, but the value still isn't there.

Last year, the company had <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-samsung-san-diego-comic-con-2024">a whole Ferris wheel setup</a>, but this time around, the experience is much more immersive, thanks to a collaboration with Monopoly Go! and Marvel's "The Fantastic Four: First Steps," which hits theaters on July 25.</p><p>Visitors will be able to take their first steps into the Google Play Rewards Lab, with unique experiences related to each of the members of the Fantastic Four. However, Google also has some rewards for members who aren't able to experience the Rewards Lab in person.</p><h2 id="taking-your-first-steps-2">Taking your first steps</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4021px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xrrGvghxL2UYUS7WPvzTBe" name="Google-San-Diego-Comic-Con-Rewards-Lab-5" alt="Multiple pods and walkways at Google's San Diego Comic-Con Rewards Lab" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xrrGvghxL2UYUS7WPvzTBe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4021" height="2262" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Google Play Rewards Lab was all about letting you experience what it's like to be a member of the Fantastic Four. You step onto a conveyor belt that leads you into each of the four pods with four very different experiences.</p><p>The first experience was inside the Stretch pod, after Reed Richards, aka Mister Fantastic. Here, you get to play a game where you try to catch Play Store rewards points utilizing touch pads to control Mister Fantastic's stretched arms. The goal is to score a certain number of points within a given time.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kEGLpBTUkHRMokaRzYunpe" name="Google-San-Diego-Comic-Con-Rewards-Lab-8" alt="A Stretch game at Google's San Diego Comic-Con Rewards Lab" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kEGLpBTUkHRMokaRzYunpe.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DQvKuMLfGgAkh2pnZCfgYf" name="Google-San-Diego-Comic-Con-Rewards-Lab-9" alt="Google's San Diego Comic-Con Rewards Lab" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DQvKuMLfGgAkh2pnZCfgYf.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The second pod is perhaps my favorite, and it's the Force Field pod. Here, you can hone your inner Sue Storm, aka The Invisible Woman, who is able to create and manipulate force fields.</p><p>This pod won't let you turn invisible, but it will let you manipulate a display of cascading lights with your hands. The lights change colors and move in response to your hands, allowing you to create a variety of figures and images.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7gEpwPTu7hJnuR8K47hLmf" name="Google-San-Diego-Comic-Con-Rewards-Lab-10" alt="Different color lights at Google's San Diego Comic-Con Rewards Lab" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7gEpwPTu7hJnuR8K47hLmf.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="46fVXszDi3ESnKFzxU6smL" name="Google-Rewards-Lab-Force-Field-pod-San-Diego-Comic-Con" alt="Derrek in front of light display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/46fVXszDi3ESnKFzxU6smL.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The third pod is the Strength pod, which is probably my second favorite area. Here, you can have your own Ben Grimm, aka The Thing, moment and clobber the floor with your feet. You can team up with a few other people to stomp on the digital display on the floor from four different corners of the room, which will crumble beneath your feet to reveal a rather cool (and somewhat disorienting) display.</p><p>There are several levels to complete, which means smashing through a few surfaces. Once you smash through enough of the floor, you'll be rewarded with a special honor for saving the day.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VK6HUjH2kPceyiMeP7vXxg" name="Google-San-Diego-Comic-Con-Rewards-Lab-11" alt="Stepping on a digital floor display at Google's San Diego Comic-Con Rewards Lab" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VK6HUjH2kPceyiMeP7vXxg.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="mheHWjGL4SS74eYHMxL7Rf" name="Google-San-Diego-Comic-Con-Rewards-Lab-12" alt="A digital floor displaying a crumpling floor at Google's San Diego Comic-Con Rewards Lab" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mheHWjGL4SS74eYHMxL7Rf.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xTCDvE66h7d8MAciub8thg" name="Google-San-Diego-Comic-Con-Rewards-Lab-13" alt="A digital floor display showing a crumbling floor at Google's San Diego Comic-Con Rewards Lab" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xTCDvE66h7d8MAciub8thg.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4090px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="deYj5dBwGt7SbvvnqUZUHe" name="Google-San-Diego-Comic-Con-Rewards-Lab-15" alt="Google's San Diego Comic-Con Rewards Lab" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/deYj5dBwGt7SbvvnqUZUHe.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4090" height="2301" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Finally, the last pod was the Fire pod for the fiery Johnny Storm, aka Human Torch.

It started as an operating system and software utility suite to power digital cameras, but someone at Google had bigger plans.

And there were a lot of them! Google changed Android to meet consumer demands as fast as our tastes changed, and hardware partners frantically tried to keep pace. Every year was something new and different until the present day, where Android has settled into a refined OS.</p><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Android & Chill</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6okfEqHJFPcbznZSbSNW3n" name="android-n-chill.JPG" caption="" alt="Android Central mascot" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6okfEqHJFPcbznZSbSNW3n.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text">One of the web's longest-running tech columns, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/android-and-chill">Android & Chill</a> is your Saturday discussion of Android, Google, and all things tech.</p></div></div><p>The journey didn't just involve Google, though. Because of its Linux base, Android had a following of millions of hardcore nerds who couldn't leave well enough alone. I was one of them, and I know a lot of you were, too.</p><p>I like to think that our ideas helped make Android great because we weren't afraid to break stuff — especially stuff that was already broken.</p><h2 id="hacking-the-first-android-phone-2">Hacking the first Android phone</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:965px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="3MRppqfw3vkjXaFVqWbetm" name="t-mobile-g1-proper-landscape.JPG" alt="T-Mobile G1" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3MRppqfw3vkjXaFVqWbetm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="965" height="543" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You didn't really have to hack at the T-Mobile G1 because it shipped with the ability to access a root shell (a term to describe elevated privileges and do anything on the Android OS) right out of the box. Telnetd was your friend and many think it wasn't an accident that it shipped that way.</p><p>In either case, it was very different from any phone that ships today and I don't mean the glorious form-factor. Having the ability to force the system to do your bidding meant nothing seemed impossible.</p><p>About that time, people realized how they could make Android "better" through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/rooting-my-phone-android-newbie-2021">custom software</a>. One of the beautiful parts of Android is that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/aosp">base is open source</a>, so you can download the code, change it any way that you like, and flash it right back onto a working phone. And we did just that.</p><p>Folks like Steve Kondik and his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/want-marshmallow-your-lenovo-zuk-z1-you-can-install-cyanogen-os-13-right-now">Cyanogenmod</a> custom Android ROM were legends who were able to take what we had and make it better, stronger, and faster. The barn door was open, and nobody was going to be able to get the horses back in.</p><p>I won't lie — I bricked more than a couple of those early Android phones because I felt I could make them better. So did a lot of you guys. It was fun as hell.</p><h2 id="carriers-got-in-the-way-2">Carriers got in the way</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="og58fKiBAUZCKvQ3UyMqyb" name="verizon-sign-storefront-widecrop.jpg" alt="Verizon store sign" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/og58fKiBAUZCKvQ3UyMqyb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/dont-buy-your-google-pixel-verizon">The dirtiest word in Android around 2010 was Verizon</a>, but really all carriers tried to ruin the fun. You need a carrier so your phone works, the carrier needs you so it can survive as a business, but nobody needed a bunch of phones acting up and crashing a telco network.</p><p>That's exactly what some carrier execs were afraid would happen if users were able to do anything they liked with the software that powered their phones. A lot of folks say phones were locked down so carriers could make more money from tethering packages, but personal correspondence let me know that a million "hackers" crashing a nationwide network was a real concern.</p><p>Regardless of the reason, carriers worked with phone makers to lock down their phones and strip away all admin privileges from the software. No more sudo this or sudo that, you were supposed to take what you got and like it.</p><p>We didn't. We still don't. We <em><strong>shouldn't</strong></em>. What some didn't understand is that the Linux-based permission model was still fully intact, and if you could find a way to crack it, you could <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/root">root your phone</a>. It wasn't trivial or easy, and was especially difficult for many phones. It was easy for some, though; I rooted the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/htc-hero-software-htc-sense-review">HTC Hero</a> the first night I had it by spamming the system until it had no idea what to do and gave up.</p><p>A lot of folks figured out how to root the various Samsung, Motorola, and HTC phones you could buy, and most weren't afraid to share how they did it. But the real power was in what was called a custom ROM, and for that, you needed to crack the bootloader.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1053px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.02%;"><img id="2veoad5qJiagLUxJ64qQCA" name="cyanogenmod_generic.jpg" alt="cyanogenmod" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2veoad5qJiagLUxJ64qQCA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1053" height="790" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>So we cracked the bootloaders. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-is-android-bootloader">Android bootloader</a> is also open source, and adding a few lines in the right place means you can load the software configuration that allows an easy-access root shell. It also means you can load a completely different operating system called a custom ROM.</p><p>I fondly remember running MotoBlur on my Samsung phones, running TouchWiz on my Motorola phones, running HTC Sense on everything, and finally stripping it all away from them to replace it with plain-jane stock vanilla Android built from source code.</p><p>Of course, I also remember it not working a lot of the time and even more bricked phones. Good thing phones weren't $1,000 each back then.</p><p>In retaliation, carriers started having phone manufacturers add an encryption layer to the bootloader. In theory, you can not alter the bootloader without the correct encryption key, so this should spell an end to those rogue guys and gals who wanted to build cyber-robot-phones and crash networks willy-nilly.</p><p>Sadly, it kinda did. An encrypted bootloader is a very tough nut to crack, and there are phones from years ago that still haven't been broken into. Some never will be. Other methods were found, though, and if you really wanted to load a custom ROM on your Galaxy S5, you could. Even the Verizon model. So we did.</p><h2 id="the-real-question-why-2">The real question: why?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:970px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="rSghSmvzrWK6wGm2qxNws" name="bricked-bootloader.jpg" alt="Things can go wrong when rooting your phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rSghSmvzrWK6wGm2qxNws.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="970" height="546" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You either love the idea of rooting and ROMming your Android phone, or you have no idea why anyone should bother. That's fine and dandy in 2025 because Android mostly "just works" in all the ways we want and need it to work. Things didn't used to be that way.</p><p>It was common for a phone to ship without the advertised features, be filled with crapware from the manufacturer and carrier that ate away at system resources, and really just be a steaming pile of you-know-what. You can buy phones today that aren't great, but it doesn't compare to the garbage that companies like Motorola and AT&T (just an example, they all kind of sucked) were foisting on consumers.</p><p>The thing is, some of those phones had really interesting hardware. Since I'm picking on Moto and AT&T here, I'll use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones-kickstarted-my-love-android">Motorola Atrix</a> as an example. It shipped with an Nvidia chip that smoked everything else when it came to playing games, a fingerprint scanner, and could be plopped into a laptop shell for a "Webtop" experience. It was cool.</p><p>It was also hampered by AT&T's cash-grab software, encrypted because AT&T told Motorola it had to be, and never got updated to Android 4 Ice Cream Sandwich. That turned it into the phone that many just hated, and rightfully so.</p><p>Turns out that someone at Motorola felt the same way and helped the right people build a custom Android 4.4 ROM for it. That was a better experience than AT&T could ever offer.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="8gxg74pbbRWkVYfg3ymHXW" name="nexus-one-shrine-of-wishes" alt="The Nexus One Shrine of Wishes." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8gxg74pbbRWkVYfg3ymHXW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Other phones were the same way. I'll go out on a limb and say that every phone that wasn't a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-unlock-nexus-6p-bootloader">Google Nexus device</a> needed custom software to be worth using. You needed to get rid of the garbage, make sure everything else worked the way it should, and not be stuck with what someone in a corner office decided you should have.</p><p>Phones aren't like that today. We can thank Google and phone makers for their improvements, but I like to think we played a big part in it, too. We showed that we weren't going to just buy what we were told to buy and had expectations of ways we could improve it all.</p><p>Phone manufacturers still tried to get in the way, and so did Google by trying to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-rcs-not-working-on-rooted-android-phones">strip features away</a> from phones without an "official" version of the operating system. It didn't work. It will never work. For every genius working at Samsung or Google, there are 10 who don't.</p><p>As long as phone makers and Google work to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play-services">keep Android secure and safe</a> as shipped, their responsibility is finished. I paid my own money for this phone, and nobody in a California office building gets to tell me how to use it.</p><p>We did it because we could. Warranties need to be voided. Parts need to be fried. Phones need to be bricked. But most of all, we should own what we paid for.</p> ]]></dc:content>

According to the publication, Google has supposedly moved the watch's charging pins to the left side of its body. The post states that the left side will feature an "indentation" with "two charging contacts" inside.</p><p>Now, it's expected that the Pixel Watch 4 will sit on its left side to charge, meaning the display can now face users, almost like a mini-clock.</p><p>The publication also revealed a rumored rendering of the charging cable and holder for the Pixel Watch 4. It seems the charging cradle will feature a small dip to accommodate the Pixel Watch 4's circular body.</p><p>It also shows the two spaces where those side-mounted charging contact points will likely sit.</p><h2 id="expected-to-advance-2">Expected to Advance</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:832px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:72.12%;"><img id="GGErSKzdy6w5zz5cRgrv6b" name="pixel-watch-4-side-mounted-charging-leaked-example" alt="An alleged rendering of the Pixel Watch 4 sitting on its left side where its charging contact points have supposedly moved to." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GGErSKzdy6w5zz5cRgrv6b.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="832" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:818px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:73.35%;"><img id="BCCCitBbNA8WQHiM4uMx9b" name="pixel-watch-4-side-mounted-charging-cradle-side-mouted-leak" alt="A leaked render of the Pixel Watch 4's alleged charging dock, which will hold the device from its side, instead of flat on its back." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BCCCitBbNA8WQHiM4uMx9b.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="818" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>This isn't the first time we've heard something <em>curious </em>about the Pixel Watch 4's charging; remember <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/pixel-watch-4-renders-leak-indicate-thicker-build-and-removal-of-charging-pins">its massive render leak</a> from April. On the surface, the renders purport that Google will stick with its design from the past three generations: a circular watch face and a crown on the right side. However, these renders claim the Pixel Watch 4 will sport thinner bezels, potentially moving us closer to the dream we all have for Google's smartwatch.</p><p>One aspect of these renders that caught some eyes was that the Pixel Watch 4's back panel seemingly lacked its charging pins. It was previously assumed that these two indents on the device's older renders were buttons, but theories have veered toward charging.</p><p>The Pixel Watch 4 is rumored to have 41mm and 45mm variants, just like the Pixel Watch 3. However, the device is reportedly slightly thicker than before. This leads to speculation that Google could pack an even bigger battery into the Pixel Watch 4.</p><p>Elsewhere, pricing has become the object of consumer concerns, which is where <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/looks-like-the-pixel-watch-4-wont-hit-your-wallet-as-hard-as-people-thought">rumors from mid-July</a> come in. There's a chance that Google will keep its Pixel Watch 4 pricing similar to the Pixel Watch 3. As a refresher, the Pixel Watch 3 saw the following prices: $349 (41mm Wi-Fi model), $399 (LTE), $399 ( 45mm Wi-Fi), and $449 (45mm LTE).</p><ul><li><strong>Smartwatch deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/searchpage.jsp?st=smartwatch&_dyncharset=UTF-8&_dynSessConf=&id=pcat17071&type=page&sc=Global&cp=1&nrp=&sp=&qp=&list=n&af=true&iht=y&usc=All+Categories&ks=960&keys=keys"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/search?q=smartwatch"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=smartwatch&crid=19YAPQ38561AK&sprefix=smartwatch%2Caps%2C138&ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_1_10"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/watches-audio-accessories-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/search/smartwatch"><u><strong>Dell</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

When you're paying this much for a phone, you expect it to be amongst the best, and that simply hasn't been the case. Samsung went back to the drawing board with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on">Galaxy Fold 7</a>, in more ways than one, but finally swapped out the 50MP wide-angle lens in favor of a 200MP sensor.</p><p>So what better way to find out whether the Galaxy Z Fold 7's camera is actually better than by comparing it to a bunch of other phones? But, I didn't just pick any phones; specifically, we have the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>.</p><p>For the sake of transparency, all of the pictures were taken using the default settings, and none of the photos included have been edited.</p><h2 id="battle-of-the-foldables-2">Battle of the foldables</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HmK4mb37DfKX9N32og3mob" name="zf7-zf6-p9pf-2" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 vs. Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Pixel 9 Pro Fold Camera Comparison" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HmK4mb37DfKX9N32og3mob.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Although <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-vs-google-pixel-9-pro-fold">I prefer</a> Samsung's "kitchen sink" approach in terms of software features, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold has been my phone of choice for quite a while. Sadly, it fell short of the Fold 7 in the above comparison, as the setting sun was just too much for it to handle. As a result, the picture is more blown out, with the picture having a kind of orange tint.</p><p>The Fold 6 did better than I expected, as you can still tell that the sky is blue and there isn't a weird tint overlay. On the downside, it looks like the Fold 6 would be perfect for Director J.J. Abrams with its lens flare. Not only do we get one that spans the edges of the image from the sun, but there are some smaller flares from the sun's reflection in the water.</p><p>Honestly, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 just wins by default here. Nothing stands out in terms of negative effects, and it was able to avoid the pitfalls of the other two. But there also isn't much helping it stand out otherwise.</p><ul><li><strong>Winner: Galaxy Fold 7</strong></li></ul><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="r2rBTnqicTiupNPjg75PZc" name="zf7-zf6-p9pf-5" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 vs. Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Pixel 9 Pro Fold Camera Comparison" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/r2rBTnqicTiupNPjg75PZc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This was also one of the tougher comparisons to pick a winner for. All three phones were to 5x zoom, which means that Samsung's Fold 6 and Fold 7 are at the mercy of digital zoom, with this being one of the defaults of the Pixel.</p><p>I quickly counted out the Fold 6 as the AI "smooth over" effect is apparent in the text of the building. Even with the image colors looking pretty true-to-life, the obvious AI boost compared to the other two was the deciding factor.</p><p>I've looked at these pictures longer than any others in this comparison, and I'm still not sure either the Fold 7 or 9 Pro Fold is better than the other. There is a bit of a tint on the front of the building from the setting sun, but it's not far off from the way it looked to the naked eye.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Fold 7 produced a cooler image with just a slight tint on the white letters. Both phones do a good job of preserving textures and clarity, leaving the rest to each phone's color profile. Which means, both phones are the winners here.</p><ul><li><strong>Winner:</strong> <strong>Tie between Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Pixel 9 Pro Fold</strong></li></ul><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TkLtPTroQ44LQNp2U8Ebjc" name="zf7-zf6-p9pf-6" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 vs. Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Pixel 9 Pro Fold Camera Comparison" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TkLtPTroQ44LQNp2U8Ebjc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Last up, I maxed out the image resolution for all three phones, then zoomed in as far as I could to the sign you see in the image above. This gave me a good idea of which phone leaned more heavily on processing, versus just taking the picture.</p><p>At first glance, it might seem like the Fold 6 is the best, simply based on the brighter image that was produced. The Fold 7 was the next brightest, with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold being the darkest of the bunch.</p><p>While that might be enough for some people, the real story is told when you look more closely at the sign itself. Despite producing the brightest picture, it also has the most AI artifacting of the bunch. It's almost like the phone was trying to put an overlay of the letters, but was off-center by a bit.</p><p>The Fold 7 did a pretty good job overall, as the sign is still legible, but it does look like Samsung's smooth-over processing got the best of the hardware. As for the Pixel, well, it got everything right, even if the phone didn't manage to capture as much light as its counterparts.</p><ul><li><strong>Winner: Pixel 9 Pro Fold</strong></li></ul><p>Below, you'll find a few more side-by-side comparisons if you want a few other examples of how these foldable phones stack up.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sccndUYXwpcz3bvWdjHr7c" name="zf7-zf6-p9pf-1" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 vs. Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Pixel 9 Pro Fold Camera Comparison" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sccndUYXwpcz3bvWdjHr7c.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ardMGvaRxKZ5hWQwpHyxac" name="zf7-zf6-p9pf-3" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 vs. Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Pixel 9 Pro Fold Camera Comparison" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ardMGvaRxKZ5hWQwpHyxac.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="f6CeTLXrG6jtXoEBkuaEdc" name="zf7-zf6-p9pf-4" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 vs. Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Pixel 9 Pro Fold Camera Comparison" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f6CeTLXrG6jtXoEBkuaEdc.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><h2 id="foldable-vs-slabs-2">Foldable vs. Slabs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9Dj9DNTZzDtmE3W7SS22nb" name="zf7-s25u-16pm-7" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 vs. Galaxy S25 Ultra vs. iPhone 16 Pro Max Camera Comparison" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9Dj9DNTZzDtmE3W7SS22nb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In an effort to "put my money where my mouth is," the Galaxy S25 Ultra and iPhone 16 Pro Max joined the other phones on this adventure.

Usually, I lean more towards cooler-toned pictures, but both the iPhone and S25 Ultra ended up as backups for the next Abrams film.</p><p>Curiously, instead of the "linear" lens flare found in the S25 Ultra's picture, the iPhone produced a lone dot off to the bottom left, along with a cluster right behind where the sun reflects off of the water. I don't know why this happened or what explanation there could be, but even with its darker tones, the Fold 7 was my favorite here.</p><ul><li><strong>Winner: Galaxy Z Fold 7</strong></li></ul><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JPAxQCrYFd784oDhN9M8sc" name="zf7-s25u-16pm-2" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 vs. Galaxy S25 Ultra vs. iPhone 16 Pro Max Camera Comparison" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JPAxQCrYFd784oDhN9M8sc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This was almost another "too close to call" comparison, but not because of the S25 Ultra. This time, it was between the iPhone and the Fold 7, as these two phones produced a bit more detail compared to the S25 Ultra. I honestly didn't even notice it at first, until I looked at the base for the sundial.</p><p>Yet again, there's just a bit too much of a smoothing effect going on with the S25 Ultra, which is definitely not something that I expected. To be fair, the same effect seems to be applied with the Fold 7, but to a lesser degree.

The S25 Ultra gave me a picture that was almost exactly what I was seeing in front of me in terms of the color tones, as seen in the grass.</p><p>The slight hint of AI enhancement on the sign is what dragged the Fold 7 down, but I'd probably put it in a 2nd-place tie with the iPhone as the rest of the picture looks pretty darn good.</p><ul><li><strong>Winner: Galaxy S25 Ultra</strong></li></ul><p>Here are a few more comparisons if you want to see how well the Fold 7 fared against the S25 Ultra and 16 Pro Max.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uBtyVLxkAtYMwxhDBuCtic" name="zf7-s25u-16pm-5" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 vs. Galaxy S25 Ultra vs. iPhone 16 Pro Max Camera Comparison" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uBtyVLxkAtYMwxhDBuCtic.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sWpWefrtpGqZNwsBEV84Yc" name="zf7-s25u-16pm-6" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 vs. Galaxy S25 Ultra vs. iPhone 16 Pro Max Camera Comparison" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sWpWefrtpGqZNwsBEV84Yc.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="L7GZi8W9TRcoKVtthsC8Uc" name="zf7-s25u-16pm-3" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 vs. Galaxy S25 Ultra vs. iPhone 16 Pro Max Camera Comparison" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/L7GZi8W9TRcoKVtthsC8Uc.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kz4gceb6WSunX92m6LrC8c" name="zf7-s25u-16pm-1" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 vs. Galaxy S25 Ultra vs. iPhone 16 Pro Max Camera Comparison" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kz4gceb6WSunX92m6LrC8c.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><h2 id="is-there-a-winner-2">Is there a winner?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4908px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="taZSyh6Ywwh2Fjzj8JGZsR" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-camera-5" alt="View of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 camera behind a sundial" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/taZSyh6Ywwh2Fjzj8JGZsR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4908" height="2761" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Not to be cheesy, but yes, there is a winner.

It's been a pioneer in the space for years, but the company has also seemingly figured out the formula to keeping its customer base happy and coming back. But with the Galaxy Z Fold 7, this might be the first time in years that Samsung has figured out a way to entice even more people.</p><p>Since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4-review">Galaxy Z Fold 4</a>, I've hoped Samsung would continue leading the charge for book-style foldables. Instead, we've seen the likes of Vivo, Honor, OPPO/OnePlus, and others show off what's really possible, while Samsung moved further and further down the bench.</p><p>That all changed when the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-special-edition-vs-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition</a> launched late in 2024, arriving just a couple of months after the Fold 6. At the time, I posited that this was "what the Galaxy Z Fold 6 should've been," but opted against for whatever reason. As it turns out, that was just a teaser for what was to come, but now that the main course has been served, is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> the flagship foldable we've been wanting?</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-specs-and-pricing"><span>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7: Specs and Pricing</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4527px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="2kWuw6f5DH4oNFJTE2JBtS" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review-19" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2kWuw6f5DH4oNFJTE2JBtS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4527" height="2546" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Galaxy Z Fold 7 was announced on July 9 during the mid-2025 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/news/live/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-live-blog-july-2025">Galaxy Unpacked</a> event.

I was definitely wrong about that, as it's simply incredible having a phone this thin in my pocket. It's really one of those "you have to see it to believe it" feelings.</p><p>The best comparison I can make is that this is a similar feeling to the one I had with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>. It's almost like this isn't even a Samsung device, especially considering how much of a drastic difference there is compared to last year's model.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5472px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="haGtyLUZAdYMPTDSAeTDDZ" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-gaming-9" alt="Gap between Backbone Pro and the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/haGtyLUZAdYMPTDSAeTDDZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5472" height="3078" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That said, there are a couple of annoyances that keep picking at me. The first of which is the fingerprint scanner mounted on the outer frame. To me, it just doesn't feel as tactile or prominent as previous Fold models, even with the button itself protruding, as opposed to being inset with a bit of a moat around it.</p><p>As such, I end up fumbling around more just trying to make sure my finger is in the right place. Thankfully, when the stars align, I've yet to actually have any issues with the scanner's functionality.</p><p>My other issue is that along with the other sacrifices made for the sake of the Galaxy Z Fold 7 being as thin as possible, Samsung almost made it impossible to actually use the inner screen. Okay, it's not <em>that</em> bad, but just in the couple of weeks of using the phone, there have been a few close calls where I was trying to open the phone, only to have it <em>almost</em> slip out of my hands. It was an issue that's only been slightly improved with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/best-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-cases">use of a case</a>, but not by much.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-displays"><span>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7: Displays</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4973px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="mWSSiUkjDPLki3XoZiSXef" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-in-hand-screen-on" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 in-hand with screen on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mWSSiUkjDPLki3XoZiSXef.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4973" height="2797" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><ul><li>Samsung still makes some of the most beautiful screens I've ever used.</li><li>Using the Galaxy Z Fold 7 finally feels like a regular phone that unfolds into a tablet.</li><li>There are some (including myself) that will be disappointed to see the S Pen removed.</li></ul><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Related Reviews</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><ul><li><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x-fold-5-review" target="_blank">Vivo X Fold 5 review</a></li><li><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review" target="_blank">OPPO Find N5 review</a></li><li><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review" target="_blank">Honor Magic V3 review</a></li></ul></p></div></div><p>Obviously, in order to get down to 8.9mm, concessions had to be made, so Samsung said au revoir to the S Pen-supporting digitizer. During my hands-on session, Samsung explained that not very many people bothered using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-will-reconsider-s-pen-return-galaxy-z-fold-7-ditched-it-report">S Pen</a>, and I can't help but feel like that was self-inflicted.</p><p>I don't know if it would have changed anything, but I wonder what would have happened if Samsung started including an S Pen in the box. This is one of the best things about getting a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-tablets">Galaxy Tab</a>, and those cost substantially less than the Galaxy Z Fold.</p><p>But shedding a few grams wasn't the only major change to the Galaxy Z Fold 7, as both displays are now larger than ever. Instead of feeling like you're holding a hefty metal remote, the Fold 7 feels like an actual smartphone again.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4814px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ihqdSu9GTEx9FgovwdGvcT" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review-14" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ihqdSu9GTEx9FgovwdGvcT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4814" height="2708" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Between that and being worried about dropping the phone while opening it, I've fallen into the trap of using the Cover Screen most of the time. What's weird is that I almost feel like I'm <em>not</em> supposed to use the main screen, whereas the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> pushed me to do so.</p><p>Besides all of that, the actual experience is pretty much exactly what I wanted from a revamped Galaxy Z Fold, or any modern foldable phone for that matter. At the same time, I have to admit that I am definitely missing having the option to use an S Pen. No, I wasn't a die-hard S Pen believer, but when you have sausages for fingers, an S Pen would come in handy when trying to edit pictures or just using the phone without the rest of my paw getting in the way.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-performance"><span>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7: Performance</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5052px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2pSNAGQFkRUbvWSiwW3pcT" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review-26" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2pSNAGQFkRUbvWSiwW3pcT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5052" height="2842" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><ul><li>The Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy is a monster, handling practically anything you throw at it.</li><li>Sadly, you can only get 16GB of RAM if you shell out the sheckles for the 1TB of storage.</li></ul><p>The nice thing about Samsung's mid-summer releases is that we rarely have to worry about many surprises.

The rumors and leaks suggest a more modest upgrade this time around, meaning that Samsung probably doesn't have too much to worry about.</p><p>When we broaden the spectrum to beyond the confines of the U.S., it's a very different story. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x-fold-5-review" target="_blank">Vivo's X Fold 5</a> recently launched in select countries, bringing with it a design that's almost just as slim as the Fold 7.

This is the highly-anticipated successor to the Find N3 from 2023, which, alongside the OnePlus Open, set a new standard for many foldable phones. While we didn't see the Open 2, the Find N5 remains one of the best phones of the year, and not just in the foldable market.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-should-you-buy-it"><span>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7: Should You Buy it?</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5284px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uQSNHarYqtCMB9R36fWydT" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review-9" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uQSNHarYqtCMB9R36fWydT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5284" height="2972" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>You should buy this if:</strong></p><ul><li>You want the thinnest foldable phone</li><li>You're upgrading from any previous Galaxy Z Fold, including last year's model</li><li>You want the best foldable phone in North America (for now)</li></ul><p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if:</strong></p><ul><li>You're on a budget</li><li>You rely on the S Pen</li><li>You want a phone with a bigger battery</li></ul><p>Despite the annoyances and concerns, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is the first Samsung foldable that I would wholly recommend to anyone who asks.

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> is a more well-rounded device than its predecessor in almost every way, with bigger screens, more battery life, and a thinner design. However, if you've used a Flip before, you'll know size was never the biggest thing limiting the cover screen's utility — software restrictions were.</p><p>I switched back to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> about two weeks before my Galaxy Z Flip 7 review unit arrived, and I've been daily driving the new model for a few days now. As it turns out, the bigger 4.1-inch cover screen on the Galaxy Z Flip 7 hasn't been the game-changer I hoped it would be. Not only did Samsung fail to expand the Flex Window's utility, it actually removed Galaxy Z Flip 6 features.</p><p>Using the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 cover screen was a game of seeing how far I could get before reaching the inevitable <strong>Open phone to continue</strong> message. Eventually, it feels like you'll always reach that dead end. In some cases, you'll reach it quicker on the Galaxy Z Flip 7 than the Galaxy Z Flip 6. Competitors like the Motorola Razr offer a fully-featured cover screen, making the Galaxy Z Flip 7's regressions even more glaring.</p><h2 id="flex-window-widgets-are-a-shell-of-their-former-selves-2">Flex Window widgets are a shell of their former selves</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GgxthA7tdSXeF7TbSuZhyF" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-7-vs-Flip-6-Cover-Screen-8" alt="The weather widget on the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Galaxy Z Flip 6." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GgxthA7tdSXeF7TbSuZhyF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung caught a lot of flak for its implementation of the cover screen, called the Flex Window, on Galaxy Z Flip modes. I was actually somewhat fond of it, thinking that the small outer display was better suited to widgets, notification management, and camera use rather than running full-blown apps.</p><p>The company increased the size of the Flex Window between the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Galaxy Z Flip 7 from 3.4 inches to 4.1 inches, leading many to assume we were getting an unrestricted cover screen for the first time. Instead, we get something somewhere in the middle. The new model isn't as good at running basic <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/my-8-favorite-things-about-the-one-ui-8-beta">One UI 8</a> widgets anymore, but it also can't run regular Android apps or add any third-party widget.</p><p>Here's what I mean. On the Galaxy Z Flip 6 updated to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review">One UI 7</a>, the folder-style cover screen can run <em>either</em> full-screen widgets or widget panels with smaller, individual items. You have customization options that let you see a full-size weather widget spanning the entire cover screen, or a smaller one that coexists with other widgets. Personally, I think full-screen Flex Window widgets — like Weather, Phone, and Samsung Health panels — provide a ton of information while looking great.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iqfrPR7kwxRTUvpD3PpHqS" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-7-vs-Flip-6-Cover-Screen-2" alt="The cover screen experience on the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 compared to the Galaxy Z Flip 6." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iqfrPR7kwxRTUvpD3PpHqS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung completely axed this feature from the Galaxy Z Flip 7, and I can't understand why. There are no 4x4 app widgets available on the larger cover screen that I've found even though they are functionally possible, and worked on older models. The only exceptions are the Apps and MultiStar modules, which are 4x4 on the grid, but are more akin to a home screen launcher than an actual widget.</p><p>Instead of scrolling through Flex Window screens to information-dense widget panels on the Galaxy Z Flip 7, you now have to find a smaller widget and tap it to open up the full visual breakdown. It results in an experience that is less intuitive and requires more taps compared to the old one on the Galaxy Z Flip 6. If you like putting one type of widget on each Flex Window screen, your display will look empty due to the half-height widgets.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HmaiLiQrBYJBagUFfNJyAG" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-7-Cover-Screen-3" alt="The Tesla app running on the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 cover screen." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HmaiLiQrBYJBagUFfNJyAG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's no good reason for removing features that should work generation-to-generation, but I could've excused it if Samsung gave me something in return — like being able to put any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> widget on the cover screen.</p><p>While some have speculated the new UI and bigger Flex Window made this possible, I can confirm it still isn't. A few third-party widgets are available, like Spotify and TikTok, but I don't use Spotify and I have no idea why you'd want TikTok on your cover screen.</p><p>Instead, I would've loved to use the Tesla widget on the Galaxy Z Flip 7's cover screen to unlock my car or start the AC without opening my phone. Alas, I can't do that. And I can't even run the Tesla app natively on the cover screen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-good-lock">without using Good Lock and MultiStar</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="H3DiBUvQEPtVmPfdHeEqoe" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-7-vs-Razr-2025-Cover-Screen-2" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 covered screen widgets compared to the Motorola Razr 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/H3DiBUvQEPtVmPfdHeEqoe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For what it's worth, my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-review">Motorola Razr 2025</a> can't run the Tesla widget on the cover screen either, but it <em>can</em> run the app without any software tweaks. It also supports far more cover screen widgets natively than the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7, including Discogs and NJ Transit, pictured above.</p><p>These are problems that foldable phones have already solved, and I'm shocked that the Galaxy Z Flip 7 removed Galaxy Z Flip 6 cover screen features without adding anything else.</p><h2 id="you-can-do-fewer-things-on-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-cover-screen-2">You can do fewer things on the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 cover screen</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3FvSxBk6eyJpHfLMC734aS" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-7-vs-Flip-6-Cover-Screen-5" alt="The cover screen experience on the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 compared to the Galaxy Z Flip 6." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3FvSxBk6eyJpHfLMC734aS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung's arbitrary cover screen limits on the Galaxy Z Flip 7 will force you to run into "dead ends" sooner, which is frustrating. You can't manage widget panels on the cover screen at all in One UI 8 on the new model; every action requires opening the main display. Simply trying to move the location of a widget or adding a new one will prompt you to flip the phone open.</p><p>As you can see in the photo above, you can easily add and manage widgets on the Galaxy Z Flip 6 cover screen. Again, I find myself at a loss trying to understand why Samsung would change this behavior. It's so strange that Motorola actually does the opposite, and will only let you tweak the cover display <em>on</em> the cover display.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Lz2pbuhMmGvbPEVgYNLRUT" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-7-vs-Flip-6-Cover-Screen-4" alt="The cover screen experience on the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 compared to the Galaxy Z Flip 6." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Lz2pbuhMmGvbPEVgYNLRUT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung let you choose either method on the Galaxy Z Flip 6, which is the best user-interface option. It was better than the Razr, and now, it's better than the new Galaxy Z Flip 7.</p><p>There are other oddities like how, for some reason, you can't open the Phone app on the cover screen — even with Good Lock. Thanks to Samsung killing 4x4 Flex Window widgets, you can't use those either to make calls. The only way to do so is by adding a 2x2 Phone widget to your cover screen, tapping the edge of it to open a full-screen view, and finding the dialer.</p><p>More taps than the Galaxy Z Flip 6, every single time.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VrvGcnomyr3K6GgV6Q5fcS" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-7-vs-Flip-6-Cover-Screen-6" alt="The cover screen experience on the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 compared to the Galaxy Z Flip 6." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VrvGcnomyr3K6GgV6Q5fcS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The one thing the Galaxy Z Flip 7's cover screen is clearly better at compared to the Galaxy Z Flip 6 is interacting with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> — the newer model has full support for the voice assistant, chatbot, and even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/how-use-gemini-live-camera-screen-sharing">multimodal Gemini Live</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NvH7PCi7foMaDkAYZ8v2LH" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-7-Cover-Screen-2" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 in black." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NvH7PCi7foMaDkAYZ8v2LH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There is a lot to like about the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7, but after a few days of use, I'm not sure the bigger cover screen is one of them.

Van Pelt states the latest update was a "collaborative effort" between global stakeholders to introduce an upgrade to users' "audio messaging capabilities." To achieve this, the post states v3.1 includes support for the xHE-AAC audio codec.</p><p>For the end-user, this update will make all of your voice messages sent and received sound clearer and crisper. GSMA states it delivers a more "natural playback" that likely comes without any artifacts while you're speaking into your phone for the voice message. On a more technical level, this newly supported codec upgrades RCS voice messages with "highly efficient" compression and decompression of the audio file.</p><p>GSMA adds that this will improve the quality of "speech and non-speech use cases." So, whether you're recording your voice or recording some music to get your friends to the cafe, it'll sound better.</p><p>This v3.1 update is bringing in "new mechanisms for connecting RCS clients to operator services." In short, this update looks to make the reliability of the RCS experience seamless and more in line with what users would expect. GSMA also states that RCS services should be more reliable in "challenging" coverage zones.</p><h2 id="rcs-continues-to-improve-2">RCS continues to improve</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GB5TtmLRcpbMih8aXYemjj" name="Google-Messages-iMessage-green-bubble.jpg" alt="Google Messages on an Android phone and iMessage on an iPhone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GB5TtmLRcpbMih8aXYemjj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The GSMA's Van Pelt mentions the advancements v3.1 makes, which are said to build upon what began during <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/apple-gsma-rcs-encryption-standrd-update-confirmed">its v3.0 update in March</a>. The major talking point in that update was the (long-awaited) inclusion of E2EE (end-to-end encryption) for the RCS standard. Van Pelt stated at the time that v3.0 brings "the first large-scale messaging service to support interoperable E2EE between client implementations from different providers."</p><p>This was during the time Apple finally incorporated the RCS standard on iPhones with Android devices. However, Apple's integration notably lacked encryption capabilities. Adding such capabilities rolled out in an update after the RCS v3.0 update's arrival. While this sounds strange, RCS, as a whole, never supported encryption to begin with. It was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-will-now-directly-offer-rcs-features-instead-waiting-carriers">Google that decided to bring such protection</a> to users originally.</p><p>As of v3.0, everyone can get those helpful (and welcome) protections.</p><p>The Association teases that its v3.1 update is the start of its focus on "media quality, service flexibility, and global scalability."</p> ]]></dc:content>
