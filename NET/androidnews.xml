Make sure to <a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=androidcentral.com" target="_blank"><strong>set Android Central as a preferred source</strong></a> in Google Search, and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should"><strong>find out why you should</strong></a> so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>Google's rolling out another major Workspace update that's entirely by Gemini, so here's the roundup of everything you can expect.</p><p>As always, Workspace is Google's primary avenue for businesses, but these new AI features <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspace.google.com/blog/product-announcements/october-workspace-drop-ai-storytelling-research-and-data-protections">it detailed this week</a> are advancing data comprehension and security. Data in Google Sheets can become a bit much, but Gemini's updates arriving for October aim to improve its format and ensure the app's analytical capabilities are up to par. Google states Sheets can now understand complex and multi-step instructions from users.</p><p>As an example, the post highlights Sheets' ability to "delete all archived rows, apply conditional formatting, and add a 'Notes' column" all in a single prompt. Moreover, Gemini advances with "web grounding." Users can now ask the AI to conduct some research on the internet.</p><p>The AI can input the information you deserve into your spreadsheet automatically, as well as opening its abilities to more languages, such as Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese, Korean, French, Italian, and German.</p><p>Business security is always an object of discussion, so new AI defenses are rolling in for October. Google says it's bringing in ransomware protections for Drive users on desktop. This runs in real-time, and if the system is triggered, Google says users will have their file sync halted. There will also be a visible notification on your computer, informing you of what's happened, so you can take immediate action.</p><p>The post adds that users can restore any corrupted files "in bulk" to a version where the ransomware did not exist.</p><h2 id="ai-protections-hit-gmail-2">AI protections hit Gmail</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="aK7fsfNsYnnbrmsSazYp2L" name="google-gemini-hero-banner-wide.jpg" alt="Google Gemini brings "custom Gems" to Gemini Advanced, Business, and Enterprise users." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aK7fsfNsYnnbrmsSazYp2L.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Gmail's also getting in on the AI defenses, as Google rolls out E2EE (end-to-end encrypted) protections. Now, users in Workspace can send "encrypted and confidential" emails to whomever they need to, even if they "use a different email provider or work outside your organization."</p><p>Wrapping up the huge October drop are thread summaries for users in Google Chat, as well as "refine me," which corrects any grammar mistakes and more before sending. Speech translation in Meet grab an expansion, bringing in English to German, French, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish.</p><p>Google highlights its video generation update for Flow and the Gemini app, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-veo-steps-up-its-creativity-in-3-1-version-update-for-realism">which brought Veo 3.1</a> to users. Over the base v3 model, Veo 3.1 is said to give users more creative agency with their generated video clips. Additionally, this updated model enhances its sound capabilities, gives users better narrative control, and even touts better "realism" for generated textures.</p><p>The Veo 3.1 model is available in Google Vids, Flow, and the Gemini app.</p><p>October's drop sort of piggybacks off <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-huge-august-workspace-update-caught-up-faster-vids-gen-ai">the one from August</a>. During the dog days of summer, Google brought file summaries to Chat, Video Overviews to NotebookLM, and upgraded the Vids app with Veo 3 (and that's now gone up to v3.1 in just two months).</p> ]]></dc:content>

The company's Q3 earnings report revealed a 16% year-over-year revenue increase, reaching a total of $102.3 billion.</p><p>This significant growth in revenue was driven by all of Alphabet's segments, including YouTube Ads, Google Search, and the Platforms and Devices department. "We had a terrific quarter, with double-digit growth across every major part of our business," said Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet and Google.</p><p>Furthermore, the report indicated that the company's operating income was $31.2 billion, which is a 9% YoY increase when compared to the same time in 2024. This amount includes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/google-hit-with-345-billion-eu-antitrust-fine-over-adtech-practices-2025-09-05/" target="_blank">$3.5 billion European Commission fine</a>, the company had to shell out.</p><p>Looking ahead, Q4 also seems promising for Alphabet, and Pichai noted that Gemini 3.0, its coming "later this year."</p><h2 id="samsung-and-meta-also-saw-a-great-q3-2025-2">Samsung and Meta also saw a great Q3 2025</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4583px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rzgiq2kADpqhT7D9e5nPAT" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review-6" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rzgiq2kADpqhT7D9e5nPAT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4583" height="2578" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-z-fold-7-and-flip-7-shine-as-samsung-posts-its-strongest-quarter-in-years"><strong>here</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/meta-q3-2025-earnings-call-zuckerberg-predicts-when-ai-glasses-will-be-profitable"><strong>here</strong></a></p><p>Samsung also reported its third-quarter earnings this week, and the numbers indicate that they had their strongest quarter in years, thanks to the launch of their foldables. The company’s operating profit surged 32.5% year over year to KRW 12.2 trillion (about $8.5 billion). Samsung's semiconductor chips are also fueling this boom, but the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and the Z Flip 7 had a major role to play in Samsung’s financial success.</p><p>These devices, along with other flagship models, tablet and wearables sales, drove the mobile division's revenue up 11% from the previous quarter. Samsung saw a consolidated revenue of KRW 86.1 trillion ($60.5 billion) and a net profit of KRW 12.2 trillion in Q3.</p><p>As for Mark Zuckerberg's Meta, it did bring in a total revenue of $51.24 billion, which is a 26% increase year-over-year, surpassing analysts' forecasts. Advertising and Meta's family of apps have contributed to these record earnings this quarter. Metrics like ad impressions increased by 14% and the average price per ad jumped to 10%.</p><p>Meta seems to be spending tens of billions on AI infrastructure to "front-load" computing capabilities for an AI Superintelligence, to the point that investors are worried. Amid ambitious AI investments, the company faces significant hurdles, particularly as Reality Labs continues to operate at a loss of $4.4 billion.</p><h2 id="finally-samsung-s-galaxy-z-trifold-2">Finally..

At the APEC Summit in South Korea, the company officially unveiled the Galaxy Z TriFold.</p><p>Unfortunately, neither media nor attendees were allowed to use their phones at the event, but according to Korean outlet Dailian, the prototype was showcased behind a glass display. An animation played on the glass display, showing how the foldable would work.</p><p>The Galaxy Z TriFold will feature two hinges and three folding display parts (hence the name 'TriFold'). However, unlike the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-is-the-most-exciting-phone-around">Huawei Mate XT</a> that folds outward and inward, the Galaxy Z TriFold will use a U-shaped mechanism — meaning both outer folding screens will fold inward.

That said, the CAD renders show off the device from several angles, giving us a good look at the device's controls, the overall design, as well as the display of the phone.</p><p>As for the 6.2-inch display, the renders also show slightly thinner bezels, which are almost hard to spot when placed next to the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-vs-pixel-8a"> Pixel 9a.</a> Volume buttons seem to be below the power button, with their placement remaining unchanged.

A code within the leaked One UI 8.5 builds hints at the possibility that Samsung may be working on presets for its Pro camera controls. So, you can quickly swap between your saved settings for ISO, aperture, and white balance, instead of having to manually adjust them every single time.

Plus, at half the price of this year's model and with several additional years of software updates left, it's a great choice for any reason.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/motorola-razr-2024-256gb-unlocked-midnight-blue/J39QWYR89Y" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="3b07482b-13d1-4b77-9b81-06e5178cdea8" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Razr Plus 2024" data-dimension48="Razr Plus 2024" data-dimension25="$499.99">View Deal</a></p></div><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-buy-black-friday-deals-2025"><em><strong>Best Buy's Black Friday sale is HERE: see our top 10 picks</strong></em></a></li></ul><p>If you're looking for a fun party trick during the holidays this year, whipping out the Razr and unfolding it is sure to turn some heads. While you're at it, don't forget that the cover screen works exactly like a normal Android phone (take that, Samsung), which means you can conveniently and quickly reply to messages, or just check the time and your latest notifications at a glance.</p><p>Since it folds in half, this one fits in <em>any</em> pocket or bag, something most modern phones struggle with. Even with that, you won't be without a big, beautiful screen once you unfold it. Plus, those two beautiful OLED panels are great even for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM sensitive</a> people since you can enable Motorola's brilliant flicker-reduction feature. It's a huge win-win-win.</p><p>Now, why choose the 2024 model over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-plus-2025-review">Razr Plus 2025</a>? The price is the obvious reason, and even though the 2025 model brings <em>some</em> improvements, they're absolutely <strong>not</strong> worth $500.

Again, not worth $500, even if it is nice to have.

For a limited time, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/JBL-Flip-7-Portable-waterproof-and-drop-proof-speaker-Blue/13927023108" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart has cut $41 off the price of the JBL Flip 7 Bluetooth speaker</strong></a>, bringing it down to just $109.</p><p>The 7 is JBL's latest iteration of the Flip series, offering improvements to battery life and overall audio quality from previous generations. Arguably one of the largest benefits to the Flip is its size and shape, which is small and round enough to be portable, but large enough to boast a truly bass-forward sound that smaller speakers can't match. It stands at a little over 7 inches long and weighs about 3.21 pounds, while offering peak audio levels of 25W and up to 14 hours of battery life, according to JBL.</p><p>The unit charges using a USB-C port and features a water and dust resistance rating of IP68, making it perfectly suitable for most outdoor use cases. Beyond that, it also lets you access multi-band EQ settings using the JBL app, along with a durable design that's equally stylish. While this particular deal is available for the Blue and Red versions of the speaker, you can also get it in Black, Camo, Purple, or White for just a little bit more.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$149.95" data-dimension48="$149.95" href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/JBL-Flip-7-Portable-waterproof-and-drop-proof-speaker-Blue/13927023108" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:898px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.22%;"><img id="9XAFfwfYXXrmRDesukgCwB" name="jbl-flip-7-product-image" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9XAFfwfYXXrmRDesukgCwB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="898" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>JBL Flip 7:</strong> <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/JBL-Flip-7-Portable-waterproof-and-drop-proof-speaker-Blue/13927023108" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$149.95" data-dimension48="$149.95" data-dimension25=""><del>$149.95</del> <strong>$106.72 at Walmart</strong></a></p><p>Walmart is offering the JBL Flip 7 Bluetooth speaker for just $107 right now, marking $43 in savings from the normal purchase price. From its punchy, clear sound to the durable, yet portable build, the Flip series has been well-liked since its release, and this generation includes a handful of important improvements over the 6 and 5.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/JBL-Flip-7-Portable-waterproof-and-drop-proof-speaker-Blue/13927023108" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$149.95" data-dimension48="$149.95" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you're looking for a portable Bluetooth speaker that doesn't compromise audio quality; you want something that has water and dust resistance so it can be used for outdoor purposes like camping, hiking, and more; having a long battery life is highly important to you when it comes to buying a Bluetooth speaker.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you're looking for something even smaller or more portable like the company's Clip lineup; you'd prefer to go with a cheaper Bluetooth speaker, or you'd like to upgrade to one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-speakers">best Bluetooth speakers </a>on the market and you have the extra budget to spend; you need something that has super fast charging capabilities.</p><p>The JBL Flip 7 is a solid Bluetooth speaker with a great shape, making it easy to get great audio quality on the go. The sound profile is both boomy, with added bass boost, and clear in the mid and high frequencies, making for an excellent portable sound that also boasts a long-lasting battery. JBL says you can get up to 16 hours of battery life with the Playback Boost setting, and for those who prefer to customize their audio, the JBL mobile app also features a multi-band EQ (though most devices now also include their own built-in EQ settings, if you prefer that).</p> ]]></dc:content>

While Black Friday weekend generally showcases some of the best deals of the year, it's not unusual for retailers like Best Buy and Amazon to drop a small selection of their discounts early (such as the offerings detailed above). It's always nice to get your holiday shopping done early, but if you have the time, it'll be worth keeping an eye on our site to see the latest Android deals as they go live.</p> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Samsung's Galaxy XR is the hot new VR headset in town, seamlessly blending the real and virtual worlds into a compelling XR space. But this headset isn't some boring old PC VR headset that you need a computer to operate. It's a fully standalone computer that you can comfortably wear for hours at a time, and that's why it's replacing my main workstation setup this year.</p><p>That might sound crazy, but there's something spectacularly amazing about being able to put my monitors anywhere I want without setting up mounting hardware. Not only that, but they can be resized and <em>reshaped</em>, so I can have an ultra-ultra-ultrawide monitor, a tall monitor, or even a square monitor if I really wanted to.</p><p>This same concept applies to any Android app you want to run on the headset. If you've used a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>, you'll already be familiar with how app window resizing works. Since the Galaxy XR runs on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a>, a new version of Android specifically designed for XR devices, it can also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/the-secret-sauce-behind-samsungs-galaxy-xr-headset">run <em>all</em> Google Play apps</a> without developers specifically needing to build an app for the headset.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="hY49GwQinBftKNAfqgetnn" name="samsung-galaxy-xr-floating-windows-chrome-official" alt="Three floating windows in an Android XR mixed reality environment with Chrome in the middle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hY49GwQinBftKNAfqgetnn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="562" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That's a massive improvement over every other VR or XR headset on the market and it also means that I can seamlessly run Android apps alongside the monitors for my Windows 11 laptop without skipping a beat. Since I'm knee-deep in the Google ecosystem, this means all my devices can tie into my Galaxy XR experience without me having to fiddle around.</p><p>Folks using a Galaxy XR to work on their PCs have two main options: use a Samsung GalaxyBook, which has built-in hooks to connect to Galaxy XR, or download <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=virtualdesktop.android">the Virtual Desktop app</a> from the Google Play Store. Virtual Desktop has been my preferred PC-to-VR connection software for years and it works on any platform you want to use, from PCs to Macs, and even different wireless VR headsets.</p><p>Samsung specifically worked with the developer of Virtual Desktop to ensure the highest quality "Monster" resolution and bitrate were available from day-one on Galaxy XR. If you've got a Wi-Fi 7 router, that experience will be even better thanks to the ultra-high bandwidth and low latency of these next-gen networking powerhouses.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Kr7mzDHWSJvi8ZroNu954H" name="Gemini-on-Android- XR" alt="Planning your vacation with Gemini on Android XR" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Kr7mzDHWSJvi8ZroNu954H.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="400" height="225" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The app supports up to 3 virtual monitors streaming from your PC, all of which are resizable and scalable as I previously noted. Virtual Desktop can also be used to easily play SteamVR games on your PC, adding one more feather to its proverbial hat.</p><p>Since these virtual monitors simply "float" in real space, I can sit anywhere I'd like and still have my <strong>full</strong> desk setup. That means at my dining room table, on my couch, on a plane, in an airport, a hotel, or even my in-laws house. That's a powerful way to work, especially if you have the freedom of working remotely.</p><p>On the entertainment side of things, I'm a huge proponent for portable devices. I got rid of my gaming PC years ago for a Steam Deck, and I primarily play console games on systems like the Nintendo Switch 2 since I can undock it and play anywhere I want.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3938px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AjkRtN6tMb3KfycbnaeemL" name="Galaxy-XR-Side-Profile" alt="side profile of the Galaxy XR headset" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AjkRtN6tMb3KfycbnaeemL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3938" height="2215" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Galaxy XR provides the same level of freedom with a metric ton of available content. Not only do you get access to every game in the Google Play Store, but you also have access to the best streaming services like GeForce Now, Xbox Game Pass, and more. There are even apps to stream your home consoles — like a PS5 — to the headset.</p><p>And while I love <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">a good handheld gaming console</a>, this experience trumps that one since you don't have to look down at a device or hold it up for long periods of time, alleviating a common source of strain during long gaming sessions. That screen can be placed anywhere you want and it never has to be held up. It's a win-win!</p><p>None of this would even be worthwhile without a good display or comfortable build but, thankfully, Galaxy XR has those angles covered, too. The design is made to keep all the weight off your face, ensuring that your cheeks don't feel heavy after just a few minutes and that it's easy to eat and drink while wearing the headset. You probably didn't think about that part until just now, but it's a problem the Galaxy XR's open side design solves.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ebcTjVdZCsPrWGp4cRhXee" name="virtual-desktop-theater" alt="Watching Limitless in a virtual movie theater using the Virtual Desktop app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ebcTjVdZCsPrWGp4cRhXee.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Virtual Desktop)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With the highest-resolution micro-OLED displays on any wireless headset to date, the 29 million pixels of self-emissive glory will light up your content with the deep contrast and colors OLED is known for. Plus, at 90Hz, everything will be buttery smooth.</p><p>I'm not much of a TV watcher, but I know that the plethora of options for streaming and video services on Android will also ensure this is an excellent replacement for any TV, especially since you can take it with you. That theater you see above isn't real; it's a virtual theater from the Virtual Desktop app, and it makes immersive watching a ridulously impressive experience.</p><p>Imagine having the best display you've probably ever seen with you anywhere you go, with the ability to run all your favorite apps and services on it when you want it. That's Galaxy XR.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="7925fdd7-4885-409e-8219-c0bf5eda6573">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:66.67%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cxXQANwssegypWVFB9SYcS.jpg' alt="Galaxy XR side profile"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class='featured__brand'>Samsung</div>                                        <div class="featured__title">Galaxy XR</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Get the best micro-OLED display on any wireless XR headset with the power of Android XR, all inside the comfortable Galaxy XR from Samsung.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Before I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-galaxy-xr-hands-on-impressions">tested Galaxy XR in New York</a>, I suspected Samsung would ignore gaming and focus on making it a "serious" XR device. But after Samsung reps showed off Stardew Valley, No Man's Sky, and traditional VR games on the headset, I was intrigued. And the more I've learned about the headset, the more convinced I am that it's a genuine, unique gaming device I'd love to use.</p><p>VR fans will find a decent list of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/samsung-galaxy-xr-android-xr-games/" target="_blank">Android XR launch titles</a>, with some personal faves like Walkabout Mini Golf, Synth Riders, and Demeo, plus some workout titles like FitXR to turn Galaxy XR into an immersive gym. It supports Unity and the OpenXR standard most VR games use, so I'm certain the list will grow quickly.</p><p>But as gorgeous as these games will look on a Micro-OLED, 3,552 x 3,840 resolution display, that alone wouldn't get me to spend the $1,799 to get a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-galaxy-xr">Galaxy XR</a>. It's the combination of XR games, Android app support, wireless PC connectivity, multitasking UI, and wide field of view (FoV) that could turn Galaxy XR into a premium gaming monitor and accessory rolled into one device.</p><h2 id="galaxy-xr-is-designed-for-multitasking-gamers-like-me-2">Galaxy XR is designed for multitasking gamers like me</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="b25Ee4cvFzaByJVywx5Kbf" name="samsung-galaxy-xr-workspace-official" alt="A man wearing a Samsung Galaxy XR interacting with floating windows using his hands" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b25Ee4cvFzaByJVywx5Kbf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="676" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Gamers buy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">Android handheld consoles</a> because they enjoy Android games like COD: Mobile, Genshin Impact, or Roblox on a larger display with better controls and max graphics. Galaxy XR dials that concept up to 11, with virtual, TV-sized displays, flagship-level performance, and Bluetooth compatibility with most controllers.</p><p>The powerful Snapdragon chip with 16GB of RAM is overkill for most mobile games, but Galaxy XR's secret weapon is its boundary-free space for multitasking. During several gaming demos, Samsung paired games with other demanding apps like Google Meet for online multiplayer chat, YouTube for walkthroughs, Gemini for gameplay advice, or a music app for ambience.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xZHJhRAguzUhSkXzJGeDtM" name="Galaxy-XR-stardew-valley" alt="A photo of a Samsung engineer playing Stardew Valley on stage at a Samsung Galaxy XR event, wearing the headset while speaking to friends on a Google Meet call." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xZHJhRAguzUhSkXzJGeDtM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>PC gamers can accomplish this multitasking effect with multiple monitors and a powerful rig. Galaxy XR recreates this effect, except you can stack windows <em>vertically</em> so it's easier to keep both in your vision at once, or use <em>more</em> than two windows. And you can play it anywhere, including in bed.</p><p>I like to keep my brain occupied while gaming, but I'm typically restricted to audio-only options like a podcast. With Galaxy XR, I could arrange more content to fit in my direct vision as I play. I could see myself enjoying a basketball livestream while playing a sandbox game where I don't need to react quickly, flitting my gaze between them. Or if I'm playing a more active game, I could binge a TV show I've seen before in a smaller window, so I'm only partially paying attention.</p><p>I also have occasional online multiplayer sessions with old friends, during which we normally use Discord for audio; if, instead, I could video-call with them and see them in my peripheral vision, it would feel more like the old days where we played games in one room.</p><h2 id="galaxy-xr-goes-beyond-android-gaming-2">Galaxy XR goes beyond Android gaming</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="M8E9jXaETRhiuqkWo7J8fM" name="Samsung-Galaxy-XR-controllers-2" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy XR headset's controllers." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/M8E9jXaETRhiuqkWo7J8fM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Since all Android apps are supported, you can stream games on GeForce Now, Xbox Game Pass, or PS Remote Play, giving you access to a wider range of titles. I only wish Google would bring back Stadia, which would be the perfect fit for this headset.</p><p>If cloud gaming uses too much bandwidth, Galaxy XR can sync wirelessly with your PC using the "Game Link" feature, unlocking your full Steam library of normal and PC VR titles at up to a respectable 90Hz — impressive given the 29 million pixels the headset has to refresh constantly.</p><p>An alternative option is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=virtualdesktop.android">Virtual Desktop</a> app, which pairs with your PC for work or play, and can take the headset's native eye, face, and hand tracking and pass it onto social VR games like VRChat.</p><p>Early Galaxy XR adopters have already started playing beloved titles like Half-Life: Alyx on the headset, with no wire to the PC required. And it's particularly cool that Galaxy XR supports Wi-Fi 7, reducing any latency between your PC and headset. Even though PC VR is a fairly niche ecosystem, I think Galaxy XR will certainly appeal to that crowd on the strength of its hardware.</p><h2 id="will-gemini-help-the-galaxy-xr-experience-2">Will Gemini help the Galaxy XR experience?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zN4WmfGqM8osgjhSJiNi2N" name="Galaxy-XR-No-Man's-Sky" alt="A photo of a Samsung engineer playing No Man's Sky on the Galaxy XR headset using a Bluetooth gamepad, with his headset feed visible on a screen behind him." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zN4WmfGqM8osgjhSJiNi2N.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>During the Galaxy XR demo, a Samsung rep shared his No Man's Sky gameplay window and asked Gemini how to accomplish his next task; the assistant answered with controls and walkthrough advice.

They're decidedly average and mid-range, powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phone/snapdragon-7-gen-3-launch">Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s</a> (Gen 3). The only thing flagship about the Fairphone 6 is its price: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://murena.com/america/shop/smartphones/brand-new/murena-fairphone-6/#tech-spec" target="_blank">$899 before shipping</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NisoxgPDytWkz5KPzmGyxj" name="Fairphone-6-Murena" alt="The Murena Fairphone Gen 6 against a gradient background." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NisoxgPDytWkz5KPzmGyxj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Murena / Fairphone)</span></figcaption></figure><p>But if you want to support a company that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/fairphone-is-doing-its-part-to-make-the-world-a-better-place-is-it-enough">consistently does the right thing at the right times</a>, this is the phone for you. The company behind it all actually seems to care about both the people involved in making it and the people buying it.</p><p>We make a big fuss when Google or Samsung offers a phone that's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-sustainable-repairable-phones">not impossible to repair</a>, but their offerings pale when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/fairphone-5-ifixit-perfect-repairability-score">compared to the Fairphone</a>. One screwdriver can change most of the parts that would potentially break or go bad, which means you can take advantage of years of support. I know this because I've completely disassembled several Fairphones, and they worked when I put them back together. Often that's not the case. R.I.P. LG G2, G3, and G4.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:936px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="2jy7v7kwrFBn2XHfRL9pHk" name="Fairphone-6-internals" alt="The Fairphone 6 internals" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2jy7v7kwrFBn2XHfRL9pHk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="936" height="527" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Fairphone)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Fairphone knows that the people who make building a phone possible need to be compensated.

The only reason an old Fairphone ends up in a landfill is that one of us was too lazy to send it back for complete recycling.</p><p>Finally, it honestly seems like the company wants me to use and enjoy its products as much as it wants to sell me a new one. All Fairphone phones have been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/fairphone-3-gets-android-13-update">supported for years longer than anyone thought possible</a>. Parts are super easy to replace and cheap to purchase. The company makes it possible for you to keep using what you bought for years. That matters to me; the decision to buy a new phone shouldn't be forced upon you because a manufacturer simply decided to stop supporting a product.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="r9fATuS9QeJmq2kTWQXEr8" name="Murena-Fairphone-Gen-6-01" alt="Fairphone (Gen 6)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/r9fATuS9QeJmq2kTWQXEr8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Fairphone)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Of course, this adds up, and the phone is expensive as all get out. Paying $899 for this phone would be crazy if it came from Google, Apple, or Samsung. I could also be wrong, and the company is really good at setting a trap for folks like me who want to see the mobile industry shaken up and dumped on its head. I don't think Fairphone or Murena or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/wonder-what-life-is-like-without-google-or-apple-you-need-to-try-this-alternative">/e Foundation</a> is trying to scam me, though.</p><p>I trust them because everything they have shown me deserves their trust.

While it’s the app you rely on most when you’re lost or on a long road trip, it’s the same app that will chew through your battery, possibly leaving you stranded with a black screen. While your phone’s system-wide battery saver mode tries to help, it often makes things worse by limiting GPS activity precisely when you need it.</p><p>Google has finally heard our collective cries, with the company potentially developing a dedicated power-saving mode built directly into the Google Maps app for Android, and it takes a hardcore approach to keeping your phone alive.</p><p>Early code spotted by the folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-maps-power-saving-3611409/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> suggests it’s a complete rethinking of how Maps behaves when your phone’s running low. The feature was spotted in the latest Google Maps for Android (version 25.44.03.824313610), where code strings reference a “Power saving mode” that shows only “key information such as next turns.”</p><p>Instead of relying on your phone’s general battery saver, Maps’ built-in mode is designed to preserve what matters: navigation. Once enabled, the screen reportedly switches to a monochrome view, ditching its colorful visuals and other interface elements.</p><h2 id="strips-to-the-essentials-2">Strips to the essentials</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:987px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:70.31%;"><img id="ZA5CHRF8M4tLwLqhmSD4Ta" name="Google-Maps-power-saving-mode" alt="monochrome view of Google Maps' new power saving mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZA5CHRF8M4tLwLqhmSD4Ta.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="987" height="694" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The app still displays essentials like your next turn, distance, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps/google-maps-is-giving-your-eta-screen-a-glow-up-on-android">estimated time of arrival</a>, but trims away everything else to cut down on power use. This new mode could be triggered by pressing the power button during navigation, which would make activating it quick and intuitive.</p><p>Early strings suggest this mode works across driving, walking, and two-wheeler navigation, though <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps-wear-os-public-transit-directions-rollout">public transit routes</a> might not be supported yet. It also appears that the feature runs independently from Android’s system-wide battery saver, meaning you can use it anytime, even when your regular saver mode is off.</p><p>This could be very helpful for anyone who needs Maps to last on long trips or hikes. There are some downsides, though. Landscape mode might not work, which could be a problem for drivers who use their phones sideways. The black-and-white display might also make it harder to see things like traffic or highlighted routes, but it’s a fair trade for more battery life.</p><p>While there’s no official release date yet, it could arrive in a future beta before landing in the stable version. Once it rolls out, it could be one of those small but genuinely useful updates that make a real difference the next time you’re navigating with 5% battery left and no charger in sight.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Both speakers headline Amazon’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/amazon-ai-powered-echo-series-devices-blend-alexa-plus-omnisence">next generation of smart devices powered by Alexa+</a>, the company’s more conversational AI assistant that’s shaping the future of its smart-home ecosystem.</p><p>The Echo Dot Max is the most ambitious version of the Dot yet. It’s built as a two-way speaker system with a dedicated woofer and tweeter, delivering nearly three times the bass of the previous Echo Dot (5th Gen). Inside, the new AZ3 chip helps Alexa hear and respond faster, with improved wake-word detection and on-device processing that handles local AI tasks more efficiently.</p><p>The Dot Max also supports <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/matter">Matter</a>, Zigbee, and Thread, turning it into a smart-home hub right out of the box. Priced at $100, it’s a surprisingly capable little speaker that can stand on its own, or pair with other Echo devices for stereo or multi-room setups.</p><p>Then there’s the Echo Studio, which now returns in a refreshed form. Despite being 40% smaller than the original model, it packs a high-excursion woofer and three full-range drivers, backed by Dolby Atmos and spatial audio support. It’s powered by Amazon’s beefier AZ3 Pro chip, which handles more complex on-device AI models for quicker responses and smarter audio tuning.</p><p>You can plug the new Studio neatly into Amazon’s growing Alexa Home Theater setup, so you can link up to five <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-alexa-device">Echo speakers</a> or pair them with a Fire TV. The Studio starts at $220, available now in select regions.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1305px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="aNm6rwnACEjtCPxC5urSce" name="amazon-2025-echo-series-ai-alexa-hero" alt="The 2025 Amazon Echo series launch, featuring the new Dot Max and the latest Show 8 and Show 11." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aNm6rwnACEjtCPxC5urSce.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1305" height="734" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Amazon)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="sensing-everything-with-omnisense-2">Sensing everything with Omnisense</h2><p>Both speakers showcase Amazon’s new Omnisense sensor platform, which blends data from audio, cameras, radar, and other sensors to give Alexa+ better environmental awareness. It’s the tech that enables features like presence detection and contextual automation. For instance, you can rely on your speaker to automatically lower the lights or remind you about an open garage door.</p><p>While the Dot Max and Studio are the first out of the gate, they’re part of a broader Echo refresh that also includes the Echo Show 8 and Echo Show 11, both arriving later in November. These smart displays will use the same next-gen chips and feature upgraded cameras, improved sound, and personalized experiences through face recognition.</p><p>The biggest update is Alexa+, Amazon’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/amazon-announces-alexa-plus">new assistant that goes beyond simple voice commands</a>. It’s built for more natural conversations, can summarize information, handle follow-up questions, and anticipate what you need based on context. Alexa+ is launching in early access with these new Echo devices, offering smarter automation and a more proactive smart-home experience.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The first Thief game in more than a decade is making its VR debut on December 4, 2025 on PlayStation VR2, Meta Quest, and Steam VR platforms. Better yet, it's just $29.99! That's a lot less than many people were expecting.</p><p>The trailer below shows the first-ever recorded Meta Quest 3 gameplay, proving that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/batman-arkham-shadow-review">Batman Arkhan Shadow</a> isn't the only good looking major Meta Quest title where you can lurk in the shadows. In fact, I had a hard time telling the difference between the Meta Quest trailer below and the nearly identical <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fnVOjgm9mQ">PlayStation VR2 trailer</a> for the game.

Vertigo Games, popular for the Arizona Sunshine series and last year's Metro VR game, co-developed Thief VR with Maze Theory, known for their work on Peaky Blinders VR and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/mixed-reality-games-getting-good">The Infinite Inside</a>.</p><p>As such, you can expect this to be the work of veteran VR developers who know how to make a VR-focused title. Surprisingly, despite the high-profile name, Thief VR is launching at just $29.99 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/thief-vr-legacy-of-shadow/6429437293824115/">can be preordered now</a> for a 10% discount, making it just $26.99. That's an unheard-of price for such a title and makes it Vertigo's cheapest big name launch ever.</p><p>If you don't already have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3 or Quest 3S</a> headset, I recommend waiting until closer to Black Friday for a good sale. We've seen the Quest 3S go on sale for $250 several times recently, and there's a big chance we could see the Quest 3 get a sale this year, too!</p> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-27">What you need to know</h2><ul><li>Retroid has announced the Pocket G2 and the Pocket 6.</li><li>The Pocket G2 is already available for purchase, and is on sale for the next two weeks.</li><li>After initially announcing the Pocket 6, Retroid reversed course due to community feedback.</li></ul><p>Surprisingly enough, it's been about a year since the Retroid Pocket 5 and Pocket Mini were announced by Retroid. Both handhelds were powered by the Snapdragon 865, marking them as the two most powerful gaming handhelds to come from the company. And earlier this week, two new devices were introduced, as the Pocket G2 and Pocket 6 are slated to be the next Retroid flagships.</p><p>Starting with the Pocket G2, this is essentially just the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/retroid-teases-its-next-gaming-handheld-by-proclaiming-the-future-is-now">Retroid Pocket 5</a>, but with a fresh coat of paint and some upgraded internals. Namely, the Snapdragon 865 is being replaced by the Snapdragon G2 Gen 2, which was announced at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/gdc-2025-brings-about-new-qualcomm-chips-and-android-gaming-handhelds" target="_blank">GDC 2025</a> alongside the G3 Gen 3, and G1 Gen 2. In terms of performance, it seems that the the G2 Gen 2 falls between the Snapdragon 865 and the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5ndOilwcOq4" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Some of the other Pocket G2 specs include 8GB of RAM, 128GB of expandable storage, and a 5,000mAh battery. Arguably the best part about this, besides getting a brand new chip, is that Retroid is sticking with the same 5.5-inch AMOLED display from the Pocket 5, which is an absolute delight.</p><p>What makes this so exciting is that you can get a brand new chip, in a brand new handheld that sports an AMOLED display, all for under $200. The Pocket G2 retails for $219, but for the next two weeks, Retroid is dropping the price down to $199.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="v8nToka5jbpAdGZAY2zY5C" name="retroid-pocket-g2-colors" alt="Retroid Pocket G2 Color Options render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v8nToka5jbpAdGZAY2zY5C.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Retroid)</span></figcaption></figure><p>And then there's the Retroid Pocket 6.</p><p>Getting the fun stuff out of the way first, the Pocket 6 will be Retroid's new flagship handheld, as it's powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2. This is the "darling" of the emulation community, as it powered the AYN Odin 2, Odin 2 Mini, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayn-odin-2-portal-announced">Odin 2 Portal</a>, three of the most popular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">Android handhelds</a> over the past few years.</p><p>However, in true Retroid fashion, not everyone was happy with the Pocket 6, and it had nothing to do with the spec sheet. Especially considering that the 8GB/128GB model was priced at $229 with a 12GB/256GB variant coming in at $279. Instead, this time around, it was all about the design.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ikzi5ZVULADZS5ZQwqEi5C" name="retroid-pocket-6-specs-original-design" alt="Retroid Pocket 6 specs overview with original design renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ikzi5ZVULADZS5ZQwqEi5C.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Retroid)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It was pretty immediately apparent that Retroid was trying to do something a bit different, while also trying to appeal to as broad of an audience as possible. To some, myself included, Retroid nailed it, as the design was reminscent of a modern PSP or PS Vita, just with better ergonomics and a unique set of buttons below the screen.</p><p>Sadly, the community did not agree. It reached a tipping point, as the polls were posted to both the Retroid Discord and X accounts, in an attempt to figure out what the community wanted. In the poll, renders of the original Pocket 6 were shared, alongside what a potential redesign would look like.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Which design (pictured above) would you prefer<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1983182653311607021">October 28, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>With almost 10,000 votes just on the X Poll, almost 70% voted in favor of the redesign. As such, this redesign removed the buttons from below the screen, placing two of them below the left and right joysticks, and the other two on the back.</p><p>The potential problem here is that ultimately, the Retroid Pocket 6 looks pretty similar to both the AYN Odin 3 and Retroid Pocket 5. So instead of getting a handheld that stands out from the pack, the community decided to opt for more of a cookie-cutter design.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">pic.twitter.com/EqtWrMHQsn<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1983893104479629335">October 30, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>While disappointing, this entire saga did result in Retroid doing something it hasn't done before. Once pre-orders re-open for the Pocket 6, in addition to the redesign, Retroid is also letting you choose the layout for the left D-Pad and joystick. This is a first for the company, and is actually a pretty great idea when you think about it.</p><p>It's also already been confirmed that customer service will reach out to those who pre-ordered based on the original design, while some have already been refunded.

A new report has found that Android users are more likely to avoid scam text messages than iPhone users.</p><p>Google partnered with YouGov to survey around 5,000 smartphone users in the US, India, and Brazil to study how different phones handle spam texts. Surprisingly, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://security.googleblog.com/2025/10/how-android-protects-you-from-scams.html">company found</a> that Android users reported fewer scam and fraudulent messages thanks to AI detection tools on their devices compared to iPhones.</p><p>The report found that Android users were 58% more likely than iOS users to report not receiving any scam texts in the week preceding the survey. The advantage on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/best-google-pixel-phones">Pixel phones</a> was even greater, with owners 96% more likely than iPhone users to report zero scam texts.</p><p>Moreover, Android users were 20% more likely than iOS users to describe their device's scam protection as "very effective" or "extremely effective."

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/first-official-look-at-samsung-trifold-phone">Galaxy Z Trifold</a> will be officially launched soon. Well, here is if you live in one of the markets where the phone will likely launch; that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-wild-trifold-phone-is-almost-here-but-you-cant-have-it">doesn't include North America</a>. Of course, nothing is official until it's said out loud and made official, but I don't see any indication of a worldwide launch. That's smart.</p><p>Supposedly, the Trifold is set to launch in a handful of Asian markets with no word on a release anywhere else, which is exactly what Samsung needs to do with this one. You really only need to remember the launch of the first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-camera-comparison">Galaxy Z Fold</a> to understand why. The phone was generally well-received, but even more so in places like South Korea and less so in the U.S. There are three reasons why.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="LyRSfFksQtBk5J5zxM6r7T" name="galaxy-fold-martian-green-open-aod-crease.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LyRSfFksQtBk5J5zxM6r7T.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure><h2 id="why-western-markets-might-be-skipped-2">Why western markets might be skipped</h2><p>The first is the price. I can't tell you what a U.S. MSRP of the Galaxy Z Trifold would be, but I can tell you it would be sky high. Like $2,500+ range. Maybe that's not a bad price because of the cost to design and build it (especially the initial model), but most people aren't going to think like that. They will see a giant price and scoff, which isn't good for business. When consumers start to think of high prices when considering a brand of product, they look at others a little more.</p><p>Next, there are going to be problems. Honestly, I don't think the device will have too many issues, but a first generation that's this complicated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ask-jerry-are-tri-fold-phones-inherently-weak"><em>has</em> to have a few</a>. A few issues with a device that costs as much as a used car aren't going to sit well. It shouldn't sit well. Besides the bad press and pictures of faulty foldables, the stigma that the original Fold had of being a "bad product" lasted longer than it should have. Even now, many feel <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ask-jerry-will-foldable-phones-ever-be-durable">foldables are fragile</a>, finicky devices that aren't going to last as long as it takes to pay them off. All this was because a handful of the first ones sold were plastered all over social media, showing their problems.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:700px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:61.00%;"><img id="pqMoqKxXFd7xQM8VKZJAJT" name="galaxy-z-trifold-first-look-4" alt="First look at Galaxy Z TriFold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pqMoqKxXFd7xQM8VKZJAJT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="700" height="427" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Dailian)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="a-perfect-mix-early-adopters-and-curious-consumers-in-asia-2">A perfect mix early adopters and curious consumers in Asia</h2><p>Now let's talk about the Asian market. Specifically, Samsung's homeland of South Korea. Any issues are going to affect these phones just like they would in the U.S. The price is going to be crazy high, just like it would be in North America or Europe. None of that will change, but the response to them would.</p><p>Asian tech consumers are savvy, maybe more savvy than most of us, because they are exposed to all sorts of products we don't get to see in the West. They will see the problems, know it's priced very high, and want it anyway.</p><p>The tech culture for much of Asia is different from ours, and many consumers are ready to try something new and know that it will cost them. In the U.S, we call those people "early adopters," and there are a few. There are more of them in other parts of the world, though.</p><p>In South Korea specifically, there is another thing: national pride. If Samsung were a North American company, things would be identical, and Americans would take pride in supporting the largest maker of electronics the world has ever seen. Samsung deserves it.</p><p>This pride in knowing the best devices come from "home" won't make issues go away, but it will make them more accepted. We know this because a lot of people bought American cars in the 1970s and '80s, even though a superior product was available from Japan or Europe. It was a sense of national pride, and buying "American" was important.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="uxXRHZUDqc8RXw9JWFUXtH" name="Huawei Mate XT Ultimate Design" alt="Huawei Mate XT Ultimate Design hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uxXRHZUDqc8RXw9JWFUXtH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/foldables-arent-really-small-phone-youve-been-looking-yet">I'm looking forward</a> to checking out a good "trifold" Android phone, and chances are it will be one from Samsung. What can I say? I hate a lot of what the company does, but I also think they make the best consumer electronics money can buy.</p><p>I don't look forward to spending too much to do it and being plagued with problems that might not be fixable in a first-generation product. I want to see version two, or maybe even version three. For that to happen, version one has to be a success, and keeping it in Asia, close to home, is a good move to help it become one.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The company could have bundled these changes with November's update, but the issue may have been serious enough to push it ahead of schedule.</p><h2 id="surprise-pixel-update-hints-at-possible-security-fix-2">Surprise Pixel update hints at possible security fix</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7MJmo5FWzPLz2ExssZM2pY" name="pixel-software-update" alt="Checking for software update on a Google Pixel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7MJmo5FWzPLz2ExssZM2pY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sanuj Bhatia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you have a Pixel smartphone, you can check for updates by going to <strong>Settings > System > Software updates > System update > Check for update</strong>.

After installing, users hopping into their Gboard Preferences should find the new "Flick keys to enter symbols" feature. This feature is toggleable, meaning you don't need to have it on if you dislike it. Google explains that, if this is turned on, users can "touch a key and pull downward to enter its hinted symbol."</p><p>This "pull downward" action should be quick—like a flick. However, Google has implemented a sensitivity option, so users can get the action how they want it.</p><p>While the term "hinted" symbol may seem strange, what this refers to are the extra icons seen at the top right corner of the keyboard letters. This, most significantly, concerns the top row of letters: Q, W, E, R, T, Y, U, I, O, and P. Each letter features numbers one through zero, which can be typed via a flick, instead of the usual sub-menu.</p><p>The publication states that the update seems to be widely rolled out, as of this week, so users should begin noticing it more consistently, too.</p><h2 id="gboard-s-on-a-streak-2">Gboard's on a streak</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:578px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:103.81%;"><img id="zHtR6m3WCmG7hW9TbDFsLk" name="gboard-flick-for-hinted-symbols" alt="Gboard has rolled out an update for Android that brings a "flick keys to enter symbols," which concerns the numbers on the top row of letters on the keyboard." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zHtR6m3WCmG7hW9TbDFsLk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="578" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This is the second update to hit Gboard in a week, as the other patch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gboard-update-gives-android-users-more-control-over-their-keyboard-setup">brought a more minimalistic keyboard</a> to Android users. Keyboards can look a bit busy, but Google tried to turn that down by giving users the option to hide punctuation marks. New toggles brought the choice to hide the period and comma keys, which makes the spacebar wider at the bottom.</p><p>It's an update that may not appeal to everyone, as you might still want those punctuation marks (especially if you're writing a bunch).</p><p>Gboard also marked <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gboard-download-milestone-shortcut-ui-update">a major achievement</a> this year: 10 billion downloads. It's become an Android classic by this point, and users are still flocking toward the keyboard to this day. To go along with the celebrations, Google rolled out a small update for Gboard that changed its Shortcut UI. The UI now flows seamlessly into your Android's coloring scheme, making it feel a little more modern, despite the app's original launch (pre-rebrand) back in 2013.</p><p>Let's also not forget <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/june-2024-android-feature-drop">the massive updates</a> that hit Gboard and its Emoji Kitchen that brought sticker combinations for endless emotional creativity.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The domed Actua 360 display is a more natural design progression, while also stretching the touchscreen to the edge, removing the wasted border space I hated on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Watch 2</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2821px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="FXcXVPbs57i2sCnpcy8vjM" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-4-concentric-watch-face" alt="A photo of the Google Pixel Watch 4 sitting on a cloth chair cushion, showing the Concentric watch face with white hour, minute, and second numbers extending to the edge of the domed display." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FXcXVPbs57i2sCnpcy8vjM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2821" height="1587" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You'll need time to adjust to the domed display, which embellishes the Wear OS 6 effect of magnifying centered content.  It's certainly helpful for making notifications and Tiles more readable, but you don't usually see <em>warping</em> like this on a display, and the dome adds slight resistance to left-right swipes.</p><p>I can't predict whether <em>you</em> will like the display. My coworkers who've seen it for themselves either think it's the "best looking display" on any smartwatch or it's a weird distraction. But you won't know until you get your hands on it.</p><p>In my case, it's grown on me, with the display's vivid brightness and smooth scrolling improving the experience. In particular, Google's 1.49-inch 45mm model looks more natural than before, and I appreciate how Wear OS reflows content to leverage that extra space.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3640px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="f8sYvBcngybvkjfZtvbM59" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-4-repair-screw-2" alt="A photo of the Google Pixel Watch 4 45mm case held in hand, with the bands removed, exposing a slot where a screw is visible." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f8sYvBcngybvkjfZtvbM59.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3640" height="2047" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another important upgrade is how Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/why-pixel-watch-4-repairability-is-such-a-big-deal">made the Watch 4 fully repairable</a>. I haven't attempted it myself, but knowing I can remove the bands, unscrew two screws with a cheap bit to loosen the real glass seal, and access the components in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Google+Pixel+Watch+4+Battery+Replacement/197169">20 minutes</a> is exciting.</p><p>Most smartwatches' components are fused with heat and glue; an expert can disassemble and resolder them, but with no guarantee they'll still work or maintain waterproofing.

I still wouldn't recommend it to mountain climbers, but it's easier to recommend for everyday athletes thanks to its repairability.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-google-pixel-watch-4-hardware-battery-and-charging"><span>Google Pixel Watch 4 hardware, battery, and charging</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="jrS39xhdqGCpAxTvQEeJjm" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-4-notifications" alt="Notifications on the Google Pixel Watch 4 laying on a chair." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jrS39xhdqGCpAxTvQEeJjm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>Snapdragon W5 Gen 2 adds satellite but only minor efficiency boost</strong></li><li><strong>Battery life continues to creep upwards to two-day range</strong></li><li><strong>Charging is significantly faster with new Dock</strong></li></ul><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Editorials</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/the-pixel-watch-4-secret-weapon"><strong>The Pixel Watch 4 has a secret weapon</strong></a></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/wear-os/finding-the-best-custom-watch-faces-wear-os-6-facer-watchmaker"><strong>Custom watch faces on the Pixel Watch 4 are fantastic</strong></a></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4-early-impressions"><strong>The Pixel Watch 4 is impressive, but has its quirks</strong></a></p></div></div><p>I expected the Watch 4's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/snapdragon-w5-gen-2-revealed-with-satellite-sos-but-no-major-power-boost">Snapdragon W5 Gen 2</a> to deliver a generational performance boost, the culmination of Google and Qualcomm's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/snapdragon-wear-risc-v-upgrade">RISC-V partnership</a>.

Without your phone on hand to relay things, though, my Watch 4 LTE can be slow at some tasks, like pulling up Google Maps directions.</p><p>I suspect the Gen 2 will be a stopgap chip, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-5">Pixel Watch 5</a> enhancing on-device Gemini smarts and overall speed.

If your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-use-satellite-sos-on-google-pixel">phone has satellite</a>, it might feel superfluous, but since the Watch 4 will probably outlast your phone battery, it could easily pay off when you desperately need it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="DkqsoumCarqVNWKErR5Ufm" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-4-satellite-connectivity" alt="The Satellite SOS test connection feature on the Google Pixel Watch 4." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DkqsoumCarqVNWKErR5Ufm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google also gave the Watch 4 a new coprocessor that's "25% faster at half the power," tailored for on-device AI and background tasks. Then you have a more efficient connection between phone and watch via Bluetooth 6, on top of a 10% software efficiency boost from Wear OS 6.</p><p>The combined effect on battery life is subtle, but significant. You won't notice a difference for power-hungry tasks like phone calls or app use. But my Watch 4 45mm will get through an eight-hour workday of HR tracking, notifications, and AOD — or a night of HR, SpO2, stress, breathing, skin temp, and other stats — and only use about 15% battery, when an older Pixel Watch might have lost 33% in that span.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="G4GtXkThPfe5ifEhCKQzGm" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-4-Quick-Charge-Dock" alt="The Google Pixel Watch 4 held in hand with the Quick Charge Dock magnetically attached to the bottom." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/G4GtXkThPfe5ifEhCKQzGm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Even better, the Watch 4's Quick Charge Dock is absurdly fast.

The full version won't launch until 2026, but critiquing the current lame-duck Fitbit app for things the new version will solve feels silly.</p><p>In my Pixel Watch 3 review, I noted that Google needed longer-term plans for multiple sports instead of daily running suggestions and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-cardio-load-and-target-load-explained">Cardio Load</a>; now, you can build a weeks-long, personalized training plan across dozens of sports and over 1,000 exercise types, after about 5–10 minutes of AI Q&A, with more allowance for rest days.</p><p>Likewise, while I find the current Fitbit UI unintuitive, burying useful trends and reports in submenus, the Fitbit preview highlights relevant trends, good or bad, with contextual "Insight" cards in the Today tab.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="imq2f8NiUMqSknzNtffshN" name="Fitbit-Premium-Health-Coach-workout-plan" alt="A photo of the Google Pixel Watch 4 sitting next to a Pixel 9a open to the Fitbit app, showing the Fitbit Premium Health Coach preview with the Fitness tab open; it shows a customized workout plan with three upcoming runs." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/imq2f8NiUMqSknzNtffshN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I've already built a workout plan, tailored for my upcoming marathon, and asked the Gemini-based coach to switch today's workout because I'm working late (on this review).

Bundle the internet with one of the T-Mo's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/best-unlimited-data-plans">mobile plans</a>, and you might even be eligible for additional savings.

According to Vats, Samsung has pushed an update for its internal test that supposedly makes the Quick Settings menu icons "pop." Samsung has included a soft, black border around the menu's icons that only serves to bring them off the screen a little bit.</p><p>While Samsung's current One UI 8 Quick Settings (and UI in general) is quite clean, one could make the argument that it doesn't pop. It assumes that blurred, clean aesthetic across its entirety, but this small update tries to breathe separation into the equation.</p><p>From what Vats discovered, the pop is just for the toggleable icons, as the containers for the icons are still blurred. Even the sliders remain pretty much the same as what we currently have with v8.0. All in all, the small change gives us <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-material-3-expressive-vs-ios-26-liquid-glass">Apple Liquid Glass</a> vibes, just with how one little change provides that pop of separation.</p><h2 id="still-on-the-outside-looking-in-2">Still on the outside looking in</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Exclusive 🔥One UI 8.5 YJO now adds outline design to toggles in the Quick Panel 👀✨A small change — but it makes the whole panel look cleaner and more polished! pic.twitter.com/yJwjr1UXWp<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1983778188611481856">October 30, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>It might hurt being on the outside looking in, but it looks like that might be the case for a while, as reports claim Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/one-ui-8-5-beta-reportedly-delayed">had to delay its One UI 8.5 beta</a>. Original rumors said we might see a beta program kickoff in November, but things have changed, as tipsters now claim that's "unlikely." Nothing's for certain now as to why the company pushed it back, but there's some speculation that it could have to do with its uncertain Galaxy S26 series lineup.</p><p>Specifically, recent reports claim that Samsung has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-galaxy-s26-edge-dead-before-launch">dropped its Galaxy S26 Edge</a> in favor of returning the S26 Plus to the equation next year. There are also rumors that the S26 series could launch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s26-release-date">later next year</a>, maybe as late as March.</p><p>Other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-could-finally-match-google-pixel-update-pace-with-one-ui-8-5">reports speculate</a> that Samsung could be moving into a world where it matches Google's update cadence and bring Android to its Galaxy users faster. A few firmware leaks suggest Samsung could shift into quarterly Android updates for Galaxy phones, marking a distinct change, as it typically forgoes such patches.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This "richer" experience Samsung highlights is brought in part by its recent AI enhancements. Samsung Internet's "ambient" AI is said to be "integrated" with the user, much like what you'd find on your handheld device.</p><p>The browser's AI can be personalized to ensure that your specific browsing behavior remains unique to you.</p><p>Aside from this, Samsung touts two major gamechangers with its Internet browser's PC beta: full Galaxy integration and security. Starting with the former, users can synchronize their browsing history, bookmarks, and more between their PC and mobile devices. Through Samsung Pass, your autofilled credentials are right there when you need them. Additionally, those AI features, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/every-android-flagship-should-steal-this-ai-feature-on-the-samsung-galaxy-s25">Browsing Assist</a>, bring webpage translations and summaries.</p><p>Users can also begin browsing a page on their phone and then quickly pick it up on their PC.</p><p>Elsewhere, Samsung highlights "smart anti-tracking." The browser's PC beta brings a feature that "helps block third-party web tracker attempts to collect personal information." The included Privacy Dashboard reportedly gives users a bird's eye view of their online defenses.</p><h2 id="connecting-the-galaxy-like-constellations-2">Connecting the Galaxy, like Constellations</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:52.10%;"><img id="SLMzKZfmASQtnhSwfLMrZd" name="samsung-internet-on-pc-browsing-data-info" alt="Samsung Internet on PC beta kicks off, enabling users to merge their browsing experiences across their mobile devices and computers." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SLMzKZfmASQtnhSwfLMrZd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="521" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you're looking to connect your Samsung Internet browsing across devices, you must sign in to your Samsung account beforehand.

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://browser.samsung.com/beta">official beta program</a> sign-up page is live right now, so you can hop in.</p><p>Samsung states that it plans to bring this beta to more areas in the future.</p><p>When we started getting our hands on the Galaxy S25 series, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/every-android-flagship-should-steal-this-ai-feature-on-the-samsung-galaxy-s25">Samsung's AI features</a> were a pretty unavoidable highlight, namely because of their privacy. Browsing Assist was among those standouts, as the feature in Samsung Internet could summarize webpages for you in a blink, getting you the info you need faster. However, another key detail was that Galaxy S25 users could have their phone conduct its AI processes completely on-device, instead of reaching for the cloud.</p><p>It's a route that would be nice if Google and Apple made, too, but at least there's one option out there with a choice. Essentially, many of the company's "Assist" features can run entirely on-device, but if you're looking for help with your photos, that'll leave your phone looking for help.</p> ]]></dc:content>

If you take advantage of the deal <em>today</em>, you'll get a free <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Samsung Galaxy S25</a> - since that's the current model - but you'll need to hold on to that phone for 12 months before you can claim your free upgrade to the S26. </p><p>Alternatively, you could simply wait until the Galaxy S26 is revealed (presumably) in January to sign up for Boost Mobile's Infinite Access plan, which will guarantee you the new phone instantly. The choice is yours, but either way you're getting a future full of free Galaxy upgrades and a great wireless plan to boot, which is nothing to scoff at. </p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="67dd7ee2-4dbb-4686-91cb-dfa7205a287f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Score $800 OFF Galaxy Z and S series phones every year with the Infinite Access for Galaxy plan at Boost Mobile" data-dimension48="Score $800 OFF Galaxy Z and S series phones every year with the Infinite Access for Galaxy plan at Boost Mobile" href="https://www.boostmobile.com/plans/infinite-access-for-galaxy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="3yYJ8LxAAtvrYDygDsL6GQ" name="boost-mobile-logo-dish-reco.png" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3yYJ8LxAAtvrYDygDsL6GQ.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="800" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><a href="https://www.boostmobile.com/plans/infinite-access-for-galaxy" data-dimension112="67dd7ee2-4dbb-4686-91cb-dfa7205a287f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Score $800 OFF Galaxy Z and S series phones every year with the Infinite Access for Galaxy plan at Boost Mobile" data-dimension48="Score $800 OFF Galaxy Z and S series phones every year with the Infinite Access for Galaxy plan at Boost Mobile" data-dimension25=""><strong>Score $800 OFF Galaxy Z and S series phones every year with the Infinite Access for Galaxy plan at Boost Mobile</strong></a></p><p>Sign up for Boost Mobile's Infinite Access for Galaxy Plan ($65 per month) and you'll be guaranteed $800 off the latest <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phones</a> <em>every year </em>you have the plan. </p><p>Both Z and S series devices are eligible, which means you can claim a free Galaxy S25 today (or wait until the Galaxy S26 is announced in a couple of months).

That means you don't have to worry about which apps are made specifically for the headset; just find all your favorites on the Google Play Store and do what you love!</p><p>On the flipside, the Galaxy XR isn't sold as a gaming console the way the Meta Quest is, despite the optional controllers <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/high-demand-wipes-out-galaxy-xr-controllers-hours-after-launch">selling out in no time flat</a>. It can play games, for sure — and we'll talk about that below — but it's primarily for productivity and other forms of entertainment, a la Apple Vision Pro. Which one is right for you?

The Meta Quest 3 is mainly designed to fit cost restraints, so it can be under $500. That includes shipping with a relatively uncomfortable cloth strap for your head and an all-plastic design.</p><p>Samsung Galaxy XR, previously known as Project Moohan, has a far more premium look and feel. While some parts are plastic to keep weight down, it looks a lot more like a Meta Quest Pro than a Meta Quest 3. This includes rigid side straps with a wheel on the back for quickly adjusting size, a large, plush pad for the back of your head, and another large plush pad for your forehead.</p><p>Unlike the Meta Quest 3, Galaxy XR doesn't put any weight on your face at all. The rubber light blockers are included in the box and magnetically removable, so you'll feel no pressure on your face while wearing the headset for long periods of time.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2CeenrvW4GFy8T8Y8tncdn" name="Galaxy-XR" alt="Galaxy XR front" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2CeenrvW4GFy8T8Y8tncdn.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3938px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AjkRtN6tMb3KfycbnaeemL" name="Galaxy-XR-Side-Profile" alt="side profile of the Galaxy XR headset" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AjkRtN6tMb3KfycbnaeemL.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3938" height="2215" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="B4MnhY68yWPKyJo82LRQ2N" name="Samsung-Galaxy-XR-top-down-on-books" alt="A top-down photo of the Samsung Galaxy XR headset sitting on a pile of books." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B4MnhY68yWPKyJo82LRQ2N.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="tPv9K5mz3qhZKHXHrPF4vM" name="Samsung-Galaxy-XR-back-to-front" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy XR headset sitting on a pile of books, angled away to show the lenses and back knob." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tPv9K5mz3qhZKHXHrPF4vM.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The Meta Quest 3's default cloth strap distributes weight on your face and around the sides and back of your head.

That's a huge advantage for Samsung over any Meta-branded headset, which all require manual IPD adjustment.</p><p>Some headsets, like the PlayStation VR2, will help you choose the right IPD by using eye tracking to display an image you can line up. The Meta Quest 3, like most other VR headsets, requires you to know your IPD ahead of time.

Similarly, Android XR, which powers Galaxy XR, is also a specific version of Android built for XR devices. While they sound similar on the surface, there are some key differences to consider.</p><p>While both are based on the Android Open Source Project, Meta Horizon OS features significant layers of customization that Meta has built over the past decade. Meta has built so much on top of Android that it actually packages it as a "separate" operating system, calling it Meta Horizon OS, and now offers it as an option for third-party companies <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-horizon-os-announced-for-3rd-party-quest-headsets-xbox-asus-lenovo">to build their own headsets on</a>.</p><p>Meta Horizon OS not only revolves around the "Meta Horizon experience," which includes promoting the Meta Horizon metaverse app front and center, but also ties Meta services deeply into the OS. Apps like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Facebook, and Instagram all have native Horizon OS apps, and while a few other apps can be downloaded on the app store, Meta Quest headsets are still mainly gaming consoles with some extra computing functionality.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="b8LPWcVz3R46fgHnxagqGF" name="android-xr-video-player-ui" alt="A look at the video player UI of Android XR running on a Samsung Project Moohan headset in mixed reality" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b8LPWcVz3R46fgHnxagqGF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Android XR is a more visually polished OS </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Android XR is built upon the Android Open Source Project as well but, like most builds of Android, Google services are at the center. Google said Android XR is "the first version of Android built for the Gemini era," which means Google Gemini is able to operate the entire experience if you ask it to.</p><p>Gemini can see what you see, including both the virtual and real world, and is able to answer questions and interact with virtual screens as you see fit. This opens up significant new design and interaction paradigms that we simply haven't seen before. One excellent example of this paradigm shift is using Circle to Search while playing Half-Life: Alyx on a Galaxy XR <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.threads.com/@michaelbtech/post/DQRqJ3fkShj?xmt=AQF0UktWuKWasSvrLVL-QjnnhYjHTLmKMVWtGE9y0LbMtA&slof=1">to translate in-game signs</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bqDoWwKVUFpYpA4vVprVQZ" name="meta-quest-3-horizon-os-ui-jan-2025-multitasking-browser" alt="Multitasking between three browser windows on a Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bqDoWwKVUFpYpA4vVprVQZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Both operating systems support native multitasking, giving users the ability to open multiple windows at once and float them anywhere in real 3D space. You can think of these a bit like resizable virtual monitors that you can place anywhere, all of which are able to be interacted with like a smartphone or tablet interface.</p><div><blockquote><p>Both operating systems are designed to enable multitasking in mixed reality, plus allow for full immersive apps and games, but Meta is severely lacking in available apps.</p></blockquote></div><p>Samsung impressed us with the launch of Galaxy XR for many reasons, but the most surprising was the announcement that <em>all</em> Google Play apps work on the headset from day one. That means developers don't need to do anything extra to get their apps in XR, although they can choose to build new XR-specific versions for the headset.</p><p>That's a massive leg-up on Meta, which has struggled to get developers to port apps to its Meta Horizon OS. While there are a handful of 2D apps on the Meta Quest — mostly communication apps — Galaxy XR can run any app your Android-based smartphone or tablet can run. That's an incredible boon for everyday use and ensures Galaxy XR is the ultimate XR productivity device.</p><p>If you want to learn more about how both operating systems compare, see our detailed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr-vs-meta-horizon-os">Android XR vs Meta Horizon OS</a> comparison.</p><h2 id="samsung-xr-vs-meta-quest-3-performance-and-specs-2">Samsung XR vs. Meta Quest 3: Performance and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="NitxdTKiUJCdu8inq98q9k" name="qualcomm-snapdragon-xr2-gen-2-chip-01.jpg" alt="A placard for the Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 SoC" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NitxdTKiUJCdu8inq98q9k.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon chipsets power the Meta Quest 3 and Samsung Galaxy XR, but Galaxy XR features the more powerful <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/qualcomm-snapdragon-xr2-plus-gen-2-announced-for-samsung-headset">Snapdragon XR2 Plus Gen 2</a>.

It offers a library of thousands of games, controllers included in the box, and a 3rd party accessory ecosystem that rivals the best consoles.</p><p>But the Samsung Galaxy XR is the better choice for folks looking to use their headsets for movies and entertainment or productivity.

This is quickly followed by "Stop using it and get it looked at." Ever wonder why it happens or what's so dangerous about it?</p><p>Hydrogen. It's what causes the swelling, and when hydrogen — a volatile, highly flammable gas — is anywhere near a potential ignition source, some very, <em><strong>very</strong></em> bad things can happen.</p><p>It's not normal, even if it is fairly common, and a lot of tech goes into trying to prevent it. Here's what you need to know about it.</p><h2 id="where-does-the-hydrogen-come-from-2">Where does the hydrogen come from?</h2><p>The batteries used in everything from phones to laptops to electric cars are based on similar technology, with lithium as a common ingredient. This is great because these types of batteries have a relatively large capacity for their size, a fairly long lifespan, and can deliver plenty of power.</p><p>Lithium has another property that's not as good: it can emit hydrogen gas under certain conditions. When combined with the construction of the battery used in things like phones, a battery can turn into a puffy, spicy pillow because it swells.</p><p>I'm going to use a phone battery as an example, but the same applies to the batteries in your smartwatch, smart ring, tablet, and laptop. Common things tech enthusiasts all seem to have.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-take-care-your-phones-battery">battery in your phone</a> is basically a thermoplastic foil pouch. It has a shape because of the components inside it, which divide cells or act as electrodes, but it's still just a foil pouch made of very thin, flexible material. It's also sealed very well, though some batteries, like the behemoths used in EVs,  will have a one-way valve to prevent gas build-up inside this foil casing.</p><p>When you "mistreat" the battery, the lithium produces hydrogen gas as a byproduct. Hydrogen is made of very small particles and will escape through the tiniest of openings most of the time. But a sealed battery — one without a gas escape valve — is usually well sealed enough to prevent gas from escaping.</p><p>When you pump gas into a flexible container and have no way to use it, it builds up. It will eventually cause the foil to stretch and balloon up, often enough to separate a phone's body or even crack the screen.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="k9owTBaAMjmxoc4MQe8nfg" name="lg-g5-battery-5.jpg" alt="LG G5 battery" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/k9owTBaAMjmxoc4MQe8nfg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1536" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I said "mistreat" earlier. It's not hard to force hydrogen release because batteries can be sensitive to external factors. That sounds like doublespeak, but if everything was working properly and the battery stayed under optimal conditions all of the time, it wouldn't happen. What causes it to happen?</p><p><strong>Overcharging, undercharging, and overheating</strong> can all lead to a swollen battery. Plenty of safeguards are in place to try to prevent this, but we still find ways to do it.</p><p><strong>Physical damage</strong> will almost certainly cause it to happen. A battery is designed as a precision component where everything has a place. If something happens that damages the construction or placement of a battery's internals, swelling can result.</p><p>An <strong>internal short circuit</strong> can cause battery swelling, and there's an easy way to trigger one: charging a battery when it's too cold. <strong>Never</strong> charge or store your battery where the temperature is below freezing. In fact, it's a good practice to not even use a device with a lithium battery when it's too cold.</p><p>Yes, you should try to be careful of how you treat your battery. They can be dangerous if used improperly, and a battery swollen with hydrogen gas only needs a spark for everything to become very dangerous.</p><p>This is why we're told to stop using any electronic device with an obviously swollen battery. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tech-talk-what-makes-a-phone-battery-go-haywire-and-explode">Thermal runaway</a> combined with an explosive gas is bad news.</p><h2 id="what-can-you-do-to-prevent-it-2">What can you do to prevent it?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5472px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tZ2LxE7BeEukX8Jjhw4BwT" name="best-usb-c-cables-hero-2022.jpg" alt="USB-C Cables" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tZ2LxE7BeEukX8Jjhw4BwT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5472" height="3078" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure><p>Thankfully, this is fairly easy to mitigate. Something out of your control can happen, naturally, but the biggest issues come from "mistreating" the battery. Notice I don't list old age as a reason for battery swelling; a battery getting old is more susceptible to thermal and charging issues, but age won't cause a lithium battery to emit hydrogen on its own.</p><p>Always charge your battery with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-phone-charger">proper charger and cable</a>. If your new gadget doesn't come with a cable or plug, the papers that were in the box or available online will tell you what those are.</p><p>Try to limit your gadget use when and where it's bitterly cold. Batteries hate heat and cold equally.</p><p><strong>Never</strong> charge your battery where it's below freezing. <strong>Ever</strong>. This is almost a guarantee that you'll create shorts inside the assembly, and it can be a major factor for a swollen battery.</p><p>Of course, if your battery is noticeably swollen, power the device off and let it sit somewhere safe for at least a few hours (because of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/technical-articles/what-is-hysteresis-an-introduction-for-electrical-engineers/" target="_blank">a phenomenon called hysteresis</a>) so the current can stop flowing.

They look similar to the ones developed by Samsung that were <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/my-demo-with-googles-ar-glasses-went-better-than-the-one-on-stage">showcased at Google I/O 2025</a> and will undoubtedly be among the most popular smart glasses form factors going forward.</p><p>These smart glasses feature a display in one lens, similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-glasses" target="_blank">Meta's</a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-glasses"> Ray-Ban Display Glasses</a>. This display uses a holographic waveguide that's visible to the glasses wearer but not to anyone looking from the outside. They have a limited field of view and are primarily used to display notifications, turn-by-turn directions, music playback controls, and other features you might be accustomed to seeing on a smartwatch.</p><p>So far, Google has only shown off glasses that use Gemini voice controls to navigate on the device. That means you need to say "Hey, Google" any time you want to do anything on the glasses. It's a great way to interact while driving or when both of your hands are busy, but it's not ideal for any situation with lots of background noise or when you need to be quiet.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Qy5kKNMYZ5UfmAMFAXFqCZ" name="Android-XR-Maps-2" alt="A still from an Android XR example video of how the software will work on smart glasses, showing someone navigating city streets with Google Maps, with a map view holograph showing when to turn." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Qy5kKNMYZ5UfmAMFAXFqCZ.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Cameras mounted on each side can capture photos and record video, giving you a hands-free camera that can be activated in a split second. That can be particularly useful when you're trying to capture something funny your kids or pets are doing, for instance, while a phone takes much longer to pull out of your pocket, launch the camera, and hit record.</p><p>Samsung's glasses will almost certainly be entirely reliant on your phone, similar to a Bluetooth-only smartwatch. The glasses will have some local functionality — capturing photos and video, and maybe locally stored music playback — but they aren't designed to replace your phone. At best, I expect them to be priced slightly lower than Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses, since they won't be able to do as much with voice-only input.</p><p>Essentially, I expect these glasses to operate almost identically to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-gen-2-review">Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2</a>, albeit with a display that can visually show you Gemini's feedback and notifications. That visual component could make all the difference to some people, though, as even a camera viewfinder on the display could make it significantly easier to frame your photo or video like you want.</p><p>And I also expect Samsung to launch glasses without this in-lens display, allowing for more affordable options.</p><h2 id="what-it-won-t-be-2">What it won't be</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vvq8PFe5YLqu8t8Hf6AJG6" name="meta-project-orion-ar-glasses-hands-on-ui-02.jpg" alt="A view of the multitasking UI inside Meta Orion AR Glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vvq8PFe5YLqu8t8Hf6AJG6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The screenshot you see above is what I saw when demoing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Meta Orion</a> at Meta Connect 2024. Meta Orion is a pair of smart glasses that feels more like a full "face computer" in a compact form factor. In essence, it's a VR headset without the bulk or immersive mode.</p><p>Samsung's smart glasses will <em>not</em> be a Meta Orion competitor. Not yet, at least. They won't replace your phone, and they likely won't play games or do anything more than you might use your smartwatch for. They're effectively a nice wearable camera with an AI assistant attached that can also make phone calls and display notifications. A way to stop looking at your phone so darn often.</p><p>Warby Parker and Gentle Monster smart glasses made by Samsung almost certainly won't have the ability to track the space around you like a VR headset (or Meta Orion) can, meaning they won't be able to use that in-lens display to overlay virtual imagery on the real world. There's also no evidence showing that Google or Samsung has any sort of input device like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-semg-wristband-whitepaper">Meta Neural Band</a>.

Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses are <em>only</em> $799 because they cut out a lot of the uber-expensive components that make Meta Orion as capable as it is, and the inclusion of the Meta Neural Band in the box only adds to that cost. If I'm being hopeful, Samsung's display glasses should come in at less than $799.</p><p>If we've learned anything about Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, smart glasses without a display likely won't cost much more than a standard pair of designer-brand frames with lenses, making them a reasonable option for glasses wearers who want more out of their daily specs.</p><p>Despite both of these types of glasses running Android XR, I don't expect to see them running full Android apps. Almost certainly, Android XR on smart glasses will operate like a cut-down version of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS</a>, relying on companion apps or smartphone app connectivity to do all the heavy lifting.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CxtFHvkRCkCFErjk2GCwn7" name="magicleap-google-android-xr-smart-glasses-navigation" alt="Magic Leap Android XR smart glasses as seen at FII 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CxtFHvkRCkCFErjk2GCwn7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Magic Leap)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Even without full apps running on the display, I can guarantee these will still be an impressive experience that'll augment your everyday life.

Now, the smartphone is generally available for $899 and runs the privacy-focused /e/OS.</p><p>It's the follow-up to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/fairphone-5-launch">Fairphone 5</a>, which debuted in 2023, and is the fourth Fairphone made in partnership with Murena. You might know the company as the maker of /e/OS, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/wonder-what-life-is-like-without-google-or-apple-you-need-to-try-this-alternative">an Android fork that provides a "deGoogled" experience</a> for users. The operating system retains only what is needed, cutting out data collection at the system level. It also adds custom, tracker-free Mail and Calendar apps, plus the Murena Workspace for business and cloud needs.</p><p>The private software experience from Murena combines with Fairphone's repairable electronics design in an effort to offer users "an ethical smartphone," according to the news release. Fairphone 6 is made to be repairable, packing a modular design with parts that can be replaced with a single screwdriver. The repairable smartphone comes with five years of warranty, too.</p><p>On the hardware side, you get a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ai-is-coming-to-more-budget-phones-thanks-to-qualcomms-new-snapdragon-7s-gen-3">Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 chip</a> and a 4,415mAh battery. Despite offering a larger capacity, the Fairphone 6 battery is smaller than the one used in the Fairphone 5, and costs less than $50 to replace. There's a primary 50MP main camera paired with a 13MP ultrawide lens for all your photography needs.</p><p>The Fairphone 6 comes with 8GB of memory and 256GB of storage as standard, but there's a microSD card slot for future expansion. The display panel is a 6.31-inch OLED covered with Gorilla Glass 7i.</p><h2 id="why-you-might-want-to-buy-a-fairphone-6-2">Why you might want to buy a Fairphone 6</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rLdnBXvAf3VCzncqtrQGs8" name="Murena-Fairphone-Gen-6-02" alt="Fairphone (Gen 6)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rLdnBXvAf3VCzncqtrQGs8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Fairphone)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Of course, the $899 price tag for the Fairphone 6 is hefty, especially when you consider that you're paying flagship rates for a phone with midrange specs. The value proposition is much more than what you get on paper, though. The Fairphone 6's privacy-first nature and repairability, which includes 12 easily-repairable parts, are what makes it an attractive option — even for the price.</p><p>Building a private, sustainable, and repairable Android smartphone isn't cheap, so you'll be paying a premium for that if you choose to buy the Fairphone 6. However, there are some that will gladly pay more for a repairable phone without unnecessary Google apps or services.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Even today, many creators still upload only in 1080p. For those pixel peepers out there, Google is now rolling out a new YouTube feature that automatically upscales low-resolution videos to higher resolutions.</p><p>For now, YouTube has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/new-features-to-help-creators/">announced</a> that it will begin upscaling videos uploaded below 1080p from SD to HD resolution. Later, the company plans to upscale videos to 4K. Videos enhanced using YouTube's AI will be clearly marked as "Super resolution" to indicate upscaling.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WJdHtcsKeskArfWqZYVQ4X" name="youtube-ai-upscale" alt="Super Resolution upscaling in YouTube" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WJdHtcsKeskArfWqZYVQ4X.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure><p>YouTube also notes that both creators and viewers will be able to opt out if they prefer not to watch upscaled content. The company will keep the original files and resolutions intact.</p><p>It was initially reported that these upscaled videos would be available only on the YouTube app for TVs, but the company confirmed to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/chriswelch/status/1983609075599601934">Bloomberg's Chris Welch</a> that the feature is coming to all YouTube platforms, including smartphones and web, alongside TVs.</p><h2 id="ai-upscaling-is-coming-to-youtube-across-all-devices-2">AI upscaling is coming to YouTube across all devices</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jZ3GketsjadpT2N5UW8QYj" name="youtube-immersive-preview-homescreen" alt="Immersive previews on YouTube for smart TVs" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jZ3GketsjadpT2N5UW8QYj.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For TVs, YouTube is also adding some nice tweaks to enhance the experience. Viewers will now see a more "immersive preview" when browsing channels on the home page. Additionally, YouTube is rolling out "contextual search on TVs," so when a viewer searches from a creator's channel page, videos from that channel will be prioritized at the top of results instead of getting buried among other content.</p><p>Another upgrade for creators is an increased file size limit for thumbnails. Previously, the cap was 2MB, but it has now been raised to 50MB, meaning you'll soon start seeing more detailed thumbnails from your favorite creators.</p><p>YouTube says the changes have started rolling out, and you should be able to see them on your screens soon.

It meets the usual IP68 certification for both dust and water resistance, as well as IP66, IP69, and IP69K, which confirms resistance to higher temperatures and high-pressure water jets as well. With that said, there are still precautions you should take when using it near or even in water.</p></article></section><h2 id="everything-to-know-about-the-oneplus-15-s-water-resistance-rating-2">Everything to know about the OnePlus 15's water resistance rating</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:64.82%;"><img id="Uk6LMmYu2uwJdwmBXcWHK8" name="oneplus-15-camera-module-look" alt="First look at the OnePlus 15's back panel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Uk6LMmYu2uwJdwmBXcWHK8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2655" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Weibo)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-14">OnePlus 15</a> has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/the-new-oneplus-15-launches-in-china">launched in China</a> and is coming to North America soon. Like its predecessor, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>, the phone boasts both an IP68 and IP69 dust and water resistance rating. The IP68 rating confirms that it's dust-tight, able to withstand exposure to even small dust particles. It also signifies protection against water submersion up to two meters for up to 30 minutes. The industry standard, OnePlus notes, is about 1.5 meters. This means you can take a dip in the pool, use it in the bathtub, or even ignore any worry if it accidentally falls into the toilet and you need to rinse it off.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">IP69 rating</a> indicates protection against high-pressure water jets up to 176°F (80°C) from any direction. So, take it out on the boat while jet skiing, out during a heavy rainstorm, or even have it in your hand while partaking in an epic water hose fight. During a demo at the OnePlus 13 launch event, OnePlus even showed us how the phone could run through a top-rack dishwasher cycle and come out unscathed. Though we wouldn't recommend it, it's a testament to the phone's durability and water resistance.</p><p>What do the other ratings mean? The IP66 rating simply means it's protected against water jets from any direction, including those that are not high-pressure nor high-temperature. So, cold-water jets from a faucet, for example, should be fine.</p><p>IP69K, meanwhile, is the highest IP standard possible. The 9K refers to high-pressure, high-temperature jets from any direction, including at close range. The "K" simply confirms that OnePlus has tested the phone under very specific conditions. To put this in perspective, close-range, high-temperature, high-pressure water jets are similar to what you'd experience at a car wash.</p><h2 id="important-things-to-note-about-ip-certification-in-general-2">Important things to note about IP certification in general</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="aG6TQwRtqW7X399CngzNq" name="oneplus-13-in-the-lake-02" alt="Holding the blue OnePlus 13 under water in a lake" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aG6TQwRtqW7X399CngzNq.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As with any water-resistant device, there are a few things to note when understanding Ingress Protection (IP) ratings. These pertain to freshwater sources, including your tap water at home, rainwater, and even a pool. However, it does not include salt water, as salt can corrode electronics. If you're swimming in the ocean, then it's best to leave this phone — or any piece of electronics, for that matter — back at your beach chairs.</p><p>Take chlorine into account as well. If you're at a public indoor pool swimming in very heavily chlorinated water, you might want to proceed with caution. The phone should be fine, especially if you rinse and dry it off after a dunk. But keep this in mind. Because of the resistance to high temperatures and water jets, however, go ahead and bring it into the hot tub, even down that water slide (as long as you have it safely secured to you!)</p><p>One more thing to note is that water-resistance ratings on any device degrade over time. As the phone ages, it won't retain the same level of water resistance. With that said, try to keep it away from water sources when it isn't necessary (of course, don't hesitate to take those in-pool and water-gun-fight photos) and protect it with a case. But if it takes a dunk with you, you want to take underwater pictures, or you need to rinse it off after getting sand on it at the beach, go ahead.</p><p>This phone is arguably the most durable consumer-level phone available today and easily overtakes the OnePlus 13 as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-waterproof-phone">the best waterproof phone</a> right now.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="7bcca6ae-fecf-49d6-9c77-2fdf930bd944">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KTcf69eMUZC6mgdp6F2uYJ.jpg' alt="OnePlus 15"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">OnePlus 15</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Ultimate durability</strong></em></p><p>The OnePlus 15, currently available in China and coming soon to North America, offers the ultimate in durability.

Now, the company is showing off a prototype and reference design for Android XR glasses at the Future Investment Initiative (FII) event. It also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.magicleap.com/newsroom/magic-leap-showcases-ar-expertise-in-glasses-prototype-extends-google-partnership" target="_blank">announced</a> a deal to extend the partnership between Magic Leap and Google for three years.</p><p>The event provided our first look at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a> smart glasses since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-i-o-2025-the-biggest-announcements-from-ai-to-android-xr">Google I/O</a>, where the AR glasses were demoed. The reference glasses use Google’s Raxium microLED light engine and Magic Leap's waveguides and optics technology to provide crisp in-lens visuals.</p><p>It's unclear whether Magic Leap or Google would ever release these Android XR smart glasses. For now, they're prototype and reference glasses that serve as a launching pad for other manufacturers. However, Magic Leap said it is becoming "an AR ecosystem partner" with Google, which could leave the door open for future consumer products.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="u7dAh7sT3vxNonDQSX8Fn7" name="magicleap-google-android-xr-smart-glasses-golf" alt="Magic Leap Android XR smart glasses as seen at FII 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/u7dAh7sT3vxNonDQSX8Fn7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Magic Leap)</span></figcaption></figure><p>"Magic Leap's optics, display systems, and hardware expertise have been essential to advancing our Android XR glasses concepts to life," said Shahram Izadi, who is the vice president of Google XR.

It's even trickier to gauge how they might stack up against Meta Ray-Ban Display, the smart glasses that recently made AR glasses with a waveguide display available to consumers. With that being said, it's clear that Google's partnerships with Gentle Monster, Warby Parker, and now Magic Leap prioritize design, style, and display quality.</p><p>"What makes this prototype stand out is how natural it feels to look through," Izadi added. "Magic Leap's precision in optics and waveguide design gives the display a level of clarity and stability that’s rare in AR today.

The company’s operating profit surged 32.5% year over year to KRW 12.2 trillion (about $8.5 billion). While a massive boom in semiconductor chips is fueling this fire, a closer look shows that the company's big bet on foldable phones is also a core part of Samsung’s financial success.</p><p>The Mobile eXperience (MX) division, which handles Galaxy smartphones, booked revenue of KRW 34.1 trillion and operating profit of KRW 3.6 trillion. Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-announces-third-quarter-2025-results" target="_blank">official report</a> states this growth, both quarter-on-quarter and year-over-year, was driven by the launch of new foldable phones.</p><p>That’s a direct nod to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-review">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a>. These devices, along with other flagship models and strong tablet and wearables sales, drove the mobile division's revenue up 11% from the previous quarter.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5284px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uQSNHarYqtCMB9R36fWydT" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review-9" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uQSNHarYqtCMB9R36fWydT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5284" height="2972" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="chips-lead-the-charge-2">Chips lead the charge</h2><p>Meanwhile, the Device Solutions (DS) segment, which includes Samsung’s memory, foundry, and other semiconductor operations, saw sales rise 19% from the previous quarter.

To put that in perspective, its profit was just KRW 400 billion in the second quarter. This growth is almost entirely thanks to the AI boom.</p><p>With the AI infrastructure build-out underway, HBM3E and server SSD demand shot up, pushing Samsung’s Memory Business to an all-time high quarterly revenue.</p><h2 id="a-powerful-two-pronged-strategy-2">A powerful two-pronged strategy</h2><p>This combination gives Samsung a strong advantage.

It's the natural rival to Apple Vision Pro, the innovative, but generally unsuccessful, VR headset priced at a whopping $3,500. It looks like Samsung used Vision Pro as a baseline for Galaxy XR — the headset nearly matches Apple's offering spec-for-spec, even besting it in some categories.</p><p>Samsung priced the Galaxy XR at $1,800, almost exactly half the price of the Vision Pro. Naturally, that makes the Samsung Galaxy XR a bit easier for tech enthusiasts to justify. Both are still firmly early-adopter products, regardless, but which one is best? Let's compare all the features and differences between Galaxy XR and Vision Pro.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-xr-vs-apple-vision-pro-design-and-displays-2">Samsung Galaxy XR vs. Apple Vision Pro: Design and displays</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3938px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3MBrZbuQASBF3AueXAK4XY" name="Samsung-Galaxy-XR-press-photo-side-view" alt="A photo of Samsung Galaxy XR sitting on a pedestal from a top-down, right-side angle." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3MBrZbuQASBF3AueXAK4XY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3938" height="2215" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung took notes from the VR headsets that predated the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-galaxy-xr-hands-on-impressions">Galaxy XR</a>, and it paid off. Instead of trying to copy one headset, the company picked the best features from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-pro-review">Meta Quest Pro</a> and Apple Vision Pro in designing Galaxy XR. The end result is a headset with a striking appearance and the ability to be used with or without light blockers.</p><p>By comparison, Vision Pro is designed to be used with its light seal all the time. There are no first-party options for Vision Pro open facial interfaces. If you get creative, third-party accessories and 3D print files can fill the gap. Either way, Vision Pro isn't designed to be used without light seals like Galaxy XR.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sMYEMG2cq2dtxp7atAqqaA" name="Apple-Vision-Pro-Table-2" alt="Apple Vision Pro outdoors on a table with accessories." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sMYEMG2cq2dtxp7atAqqaA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Vision Pro uses a cloth strap, and there are multiple first and third-party straps available.

It adds 120Hz support, hardware-accelerated ray tracing and mesh shading, and better rendering.</p><p>In other words, Vision Pro will deliver crisper images with M5 despite using the same display hardware. The headset also uses an Apple R1 co-processor specialized for taking in and processing data from the headset's wide assortment of cameras and sensors.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Samsung Galaxy XR is powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon XR2 Plus Gen 2 processor. It's still a very good chip, bringing a 20% higher CPU frequency and 15% higher GPU frequency than the Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2. The latter powers the Meta Quest 3 and Quest 3S, but the more powerful variant is key to running Galaxy XR smoothly.</p><div ><table><caption>Specs</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy XR</p></th><th  ><p>Apple Vision Pro</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2</p></td><td  ><p>Apple M5 (or Apple M2)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Memory</p></td><td  ><p>16GB RAM; 256GB storage</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 1TB storage</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>3,552 x 3,840, 29 million pixels Micro-OLED; 96% DCI-P3</p><p></p></td><td  ><p>3,660 × 3,200, 23 million pixels, Micro-OLED, 92% DCI-P3</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Refresh rate</p></td><td  ><p>60Hz, 72Hz (default), 90Hz</p></td><td  ><p>90Hz, 96Hz, 100Hz, or 120Hz</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Field of view</p></td><td  ><p>109ºH; 100ºV</p></td><td  ><p>~100º</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Camera</p></td><td  ><p>6.5MP; 18mm/ F2.0</p></td><td  ></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Sensors</p></td><td  ><p>Two passthrough cameras; six world-facing tracking cameras; four eye-tracking cameras; five IMUs; one depth sensor; one flicker sensor</p></td><td  ><p>Two high-resolution main cameras (for passthrough); Six tracking cameras on the sides and bottoms (for hand tracking); Four internal tracking cameras (for eye tracking); LiDAR scanner and TrueDepth camera (for depth perception); Four inertial measurement units (IMUs); Flicker sensor; Ambient light sensor</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Mics & speakers</p></td><td  ><p>Six-mic array with beamforming; two dual speakers (Woofer + Tweeter)</p></td><td  ><p>Six-mic array with directional beam forming; Dual-driver audio pods</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Audio codecs</p></td><td  ><p>MP3, AMR-NB/WB, AAC/ AAC+/ eAAC+, Vorbis, FLAC, Opus, Dolby Digital (Plus, Atmos)</p></td><td  ><p>AAC, MP3, Apple Lossless, FLAC, Dolby Digital, Dolby Digital Plus, and Dolby Atmos</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Video</p></td><td  ><p>Resolution: UDH 8K (7,680 x 4,320) @ 60FPS</p><p>Codecs: H.263, H.264, HEVC, MV-HEVC, MPEG-4, VC-1, VP8, VP9, AV1</p></td><td  ><p>Codecs: HEVC, MV‑HEVC, H.264, AV1, HDR with Dolby Vision, HDR10, and HLG</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>2 hours general use, 2.5 hours video watching</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 2.5 hours of general use; 3 hours video watching</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7 (802.11a/b/g/n/ac/ax/be); Bluetooth 5.4</p></td><td  ><p>Wi‑Fi 6 (802.11ax); Bluetooth 5.3</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>IPD</p></td><td  ><p>54–70mm</p></td><td  ><p>51–75 mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>545g with forehead cushion (not including light shield)</p><p>Battery weighs 302g</p></td><td  ><p>750–800 grams, including cushion, light seal, and dual knit band</p><p>Battery weighs 353g</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Samsung sells Galaxy XR in one 256GB storage configuration with 16GB of RAM.

It's also a better value, costing about half the price of Vision Pro while delivering similar hardware. When you consider all the perks you get if you buy Galaxy XR before 2026 — a year of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google AI Pro</a>, YouTube Premium, NBA League Pass, and more — the headset becomes a pretty solid deal.</p><p>There are a few aspects of Vision Pro that exceed Galaxy XR's capability. Notably, the headset is powered by the Apple M5 chip, which can run laps around the Snapdragon processor in Galaxy XR. That enables real-world perks, like 120Hz refresh rates. However, it feels like the visionOS app ecosystem isn't ready to utilize the Vision Pro's hardware advantages.</p><p>For now, the Samsung Galaxy XR is the extended-reality headset to buy if you want next-generation hardware and a great app ecosystem. It's still a tough sell, much like Vision Pro, because of its price. There are cheaper options available now, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Meta Quest 3</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-review">Quest 3S</a>, and the price of premium headsets will surely come down over time.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="51cfb5cb-7838-4858-8393-2fa1d8da7623">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PLNBFvfigQSH4NpRjcJKy6.jpg' alt="Render of Samsung Galaxy XR headset from the front-right side at a 30-degree angle."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy XR</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>For early adopters</strong></em></p><p>Despite being half the price of Vision Pro and bringing a better software experience, Samsung Galaxy XR is still an early-adopter product.

However, a recent report revealed that Samsung decided to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-galaxy-s26-edge-dead-before-launch">cancel the Galaxy S26 Edge</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-developing-galaxy-s26-after-all">bring back the Galaxy S26 Plus</a> instead, since sales of the Galaxy S25 Edge weren't promising.</p><p>Now, a new report claims the Galaxy S26 Edge might not be canceled after all. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.galaxyclub.nl/samsung/galaxy-s26-edge/">GalaxyClub</a>, Samsung hasn't scrapped the Galaxy S26 Edge despite rumors, and in fact, the company plans to make the successor to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-launch">Galaxy S25 Edge</a> even thinner.</p><h2 id="galaxy-s26-edge-might-still-be-in-samsung-s-plans-2">Galaxy S26 Edge might still be in Samsung's plans</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NrJKSSZYtxDEwx9syY4kmW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-review-03" alt="Galaxy S25 Plus cameras" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NrJKSSZYtxDEwx9syY4kmW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The report states that Samsung has been working on a smartphone codenamed "More Slim." For reference, the Galaxy S25 Edge's internal codename was "Slim." Interestingly, development on "More Slim" reportedly began later than the Galaxy S26 Edge, suggesting it may not be the same device Samsung was originally planning.</p><p>The report also speculates that Samsung may have decided the Galaxy S26 Edge needed to be even thinner to secure its place in 2026, leading to the "More Slim" project and the possible cancellation of the original S26 Edge prototype.</p><p>Additionally, the report states that the Galaxy S26 Edge might skip launching alongside the rest of the Galaxy S26 lineup and instead arrive later, similar to how the Galaxy S25 Edge was introduced.</p><p>That said, the report reiterates that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-developing-galaxy-s26-after-all">Galaxy S26 Plus will launch</a> with the S26 lineup, which seems certain at this point. There are also reports that the Galaxy S26 series launch could be slightly delayed compared to last year's Galaxy S25 series, which debuted in January 2025.</p><p>Of course, a lot could change before the phones actually launch next year, but it appears Samsung is having some internal challenges with the Galaxy S26 lineup right now.</p> ]]></dc:content>

While we don't yet have confirmed details about what to expect from the Galaxy S26, we do know that it may have at one point been called the Samsung Galaxy S26 Pro, but that moniker has reportedly been abandoned.</p><p>We can be certain that it will include improvements over both the Samsung Galaxy S24 and the Samsung Galaxy S25. With the Samsung Galaxy S25 marking just an iterative update over the Samsung Galaxy S24, the expectation is that the Samsung Galaxy S26 will be better in many ways. For now, let's take a look at the rumors and speculation around what we might be able to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">expect from the Galaxy S26</a>.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-vs-samsung-galaxy-s24-potential-design-and-basic-spec-changes-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 vs. Samsung Galaxy S24: Potential design and basic spec changes</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1154px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="gKRgz2SqdcJaUh4DKQNCAZ" name="Galaxy-S26-Pro-CAD-renders" alt="CAD renders of Galaxy S26 Pro leak showcasing a slimmer design" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gKRgz2SqdcJaUh4DKQNCAZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1154" height="649" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's no word yet on finish options for the Galaxy S26, but there will probably be at least some new colors, including Samsung-exclusive ones, as has been the case with the Galaxy series. The Armor Aluminum construction may continue, giving it a lightweight and durable feel.</p><p>Screen size is speculated to increase slightly to 6.27 inches, which isn’t a huge bump, but may provide more screen area with the same compact size. The expectation is that it will also be thinner.</p><p>It will probably still have the same individual rings around the cameras, but this time with a vertical camera bump housing the sensors . Refresh rate will likely be maintained at 120Hz along with the AMOLED 2x FHD+ screen, Corning Gorilla Glass, and the same or similar resolution as both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy S24</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Samsung Galaxy S25</a>, which remained unchanged between these two devices.</p><p>It will likely still meet the IP68 specification for dust and water resistance. Storage capacities could increase beyond just 256GB, at least to 512GB, as with the Galaxy S25, though 1TB would be nice. It will almost certainly not include a memory card slot, as has been customary with Samsung Galaxy devices and most phones nowadays.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1420px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ZnoxAMJ6w4bpnV5AeZY7AZ" name="Galaxy-S26-Pro-CAD-renders" alt="CAD renders of Galaxy S26 Pro leak showcasing a slimmer design" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZnoxAMJ6w4bpnV5AeZY7AZ.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1420" height="799" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The battery is expected to boast improvements, with rumors indicating Samsung might switch from lithium to silicon batteries, which offer better durability and density. There's also speculation that the battery capacity could increase from 4,000 mAh in the Galaxy S24 (and the S25) to 4,300 mAh, which means the phone will last a little longer.</p><p>It's likely that the base Galaxy S26 model will stick with 25W charging. It could meet its higher-end counterparts in offering up to 45W wired charging with a compatible adapter and cable. It should continue to support wireless charging and Power Share. An upgrade could be built-in magnets for Qi2 charging without the need for a case, akin to what Google has done with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-series-your-ultimate-guide">latest Pixel 10 line</a>.</p><p>Looking back at the Samsung Galaxy S24, which was introduced in January 2024, that model comes in Cobalt Violet, Amber Yellow, Onyx Black, and Marble Grey. There are also Samsung-exclusive colors, Sapphire Blue, Sandstone Orange, and Jade Green. It has a flat front and back with rounded edges and a satin finish, and cameras running down the back in a vertical row, the same as the Galaxy S25.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-vs-samsung-galaxy-s24-spec-comparison-2"> Samsung Galaxy S26 vs. Samsung Galaxy S24: Spec comparison</h2><p>How do these phones compare head-to-head on specs alone?

It will likely feature the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</a> chip, though some think it may use an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-s26-might-rock-the-exynos-2600-chip-but-only-in-this-region">Exynos 2600</a> chip instead, at least in some markets. This is what Samsung did with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-review">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a>, suggesting it might follow the same strategy for the entry model in the new series.</p><p>By contrast, the Samsung Galaxy S24 features a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor and 8GB of RAM. There's no word on how much RAM the new phone will have, but Samsung upped it to 12GB for the Galaxy S25, so it's likely the Galaxy S26 will carry that over.</p><p>Stereo speakers are pretty much a given, along with plenty of AI goodies, including Gemini Live and Bixby. But some sources suggest Samsung could expand Galaxy S26 support for third-party chatbots. The Galaxy S24 was the first device in the line to get AI upgrades, including fun and useful features like Google's Circle to Search, Live Translate, Note Assist, Transcript Assist, and more.</p><p>It's unclear if Samsung will add more AI features to the Galaxy S26, though it will likely have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-is-already-chasing-one-ui-8-5-new-leak-spots-galaxy-s25-test">Samsung One UI 8.5</a> and whatever new features come with it.</p><p>One rumored new feature discussed is called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/understanding-private-mode-samsung-galaxy-s6">Privacy Display Mode</a>, though it may only be available on the Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra. With this supposed feature, the phone would automatically dim the screen when you're accessing sensitive information or in crowded places. One UI 8.5 will also purportedly have Privacy Protection, which could automatically blur or redact sensitive on-screen information, like driver's license or passport details, to keep your information secure.</p><p>The same seven years of software and security updates are expected, which has become standard for Samsung phones.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-vs-samsung-galaxy-s24-camera-improvements-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 vs. Samsung Galaxy S24: Camera improvements</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vzZF2vMD6U3NqKAxRifnhh" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-camera-lenses-02.jpg" alt="Hands-on with the smaller Samsung Galaxy S24" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vzZF2vMD6U3NqKAxRifnhh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung hasn't made any groundbreaking improvements to its cameras between the Galaxy S24 and Galaxy S25, but fans are hoping this will change with the Galaxy S26. First, consider the Galaxy S24. It has a 50MP primary sensor, a 12MP ultrawide, a 10MP telephoto, and a 12MP front "selfie" camera. You get 30x space zoom and 3x optical zoom.</p><p>Not much changed with the Samsung Galaxy S25. But the hope is that the Galaxy S26's cameras will improve. While it might retain the same 50MP primary sensor, it could be larger, allowing it to capture more light.</p><p>It's unclear if the Galaxy S26 will see any improvements in zoom capabilities. The Samsung Galaxy S25 improved in this department with 100x Space Zoom and 3x optical zoom, so the new model's specs should at least match that.</p><p>Of course, all the same AI photo editing tools will almost certainly be carried over to the new model. This includes features such as Generative Edit, Sketch to Image, and more. Whether or not image capture overall is better remains to be seen. One area the Galaxy S24 struggled with was photos that include motion, so the hope is that the S26 will improve on this.

Do you wait to see what the new model has to offer? Sometimes, it's incredible, and you kick yourself for having jumped the gun on an existing model too soon. Sometimes, it's an iterative update, and you realize it wasn't worth waiting. It's a tough decision, but with limited details so far on the Galaxy S26, you'll have to make that judgment call.</p><p>Based on speculation, it could be just another iterative update. Feature-wise, you'll be able to update the S24 with new AI features and Samsung One UI 8.5 anyway. I'd recommend keeping it for now. If you still find the S24 new for a fantastic price and you're upgrading from a much older phone and want things like AI integration, that model is still a great option.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="3e95e6c4-d07f-4e72-a756-a7f0d1ce9fd3">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pzkcj8YMqwNYbgHkLXibwc.jpg' alt="The rumored product render of the Samsung Galaxy S26 Pro."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy S26</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Wait and see</strong></em></p><p>Samsung continues to innovate with its smartphones, but when it comes to the entry model in the Galaxy series, there are sometimes concessions that are dealbreakers.

Reportedly, the company's latest Chrome Canary version (Google Chrome's test environment) brought in two major AI features that the company has placed elsewhere in its ecosystem. Specifically, the publication states the test update focused on new tabs in Chrome on desktop, as it integrates <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-says-nano-banana-drove-in-over-10-million-new-users-to-gemini-app">Nano Banana</a>.</p><p>How Google is seemingly preparing to do this is via a new "AI Chip." This "chip" is supposedly going to be placed right under the pre-existing textbox in the center of any new tab in Chrome.</p><p>In the test, the publication states that clicking Nano Banana changes the centered text box. Instead of saying "Search Google or type a URL," it now says "Create an image of..." From there, users can type what they'd like the AI to create, which will generate, but how and where (two important questions) aren't narrowed down yet. The post states that while Nano Banana is appearing, the feature in its entirety isn't fully fleshed out, meaning those important details are missing.</p><p>Similarly, the post mentions that AI Mode's "Deep Search" is getting its own AI chip. All this does is push the AI to dive deeper into its research for complex questions (you can access this in AI Mode natively already). It seems Google's just interested in making it more "in your face," rather than hopping into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/ai-mode-levels-up-with-new-ai-features-stealing-google-searchs-spotlight">AI Mode</a> beforehand.</p><h2 id="google-s-popular-ai-features-take-center-stage-2">Google's popular AI features take center stage</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:700px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.71%;"><img id="YiYjp3BtuW3PRccBmHBn9T" name="google-chrome-test-nano-banana-deep-search-chips-new-tab" alt="A screenshot from a Google Chrome test, which shows the company is supposedly testing a Nano Banana and Deep Search from AI Mode "chip" on new tabs." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YiYjp3BtuW3PRccBmHBn9T.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="700" height="467" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Windows Report)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In a way, it makes sense that Google is trying so hard to push its AI Mode software to more people in a place where they often start.

Gemini in Chrome was the big headline in September, as Google improved browsing, security, and more for Android and PC users. Now, when scrolling through articles or other lengthy pages in Chrome, users can tap the Gemini icon and have it summarize its contents.</p><p>That huge September brought the AI Mode icon to Chrome's New Tab page, too.

The company stated in its press release that this phone is "crafted for a generation tired of the ordinary."  This budget device arrives with most of the Nothing 3a's features but is only lighter on your pocket.</p><p>At first glance, the phone gets Nothing's signature transparent design for its rear panel. The glass on both the display and the rear is protected by Panda Glass and an aluminum inner frame, which gives the device more longevity, giving the phone its IP54 rating for dust and splash resistance.</p><p>Additionally, the well-known "Glyph Light" does make a comeback, but not as the strips.

Coming to its display, it gets a reasonably large 6.7-inch FHD+ Flexible AMOLED screen with a 120Hz refresh rate.</p><p>Another highlight of the device is that it gets a massive 5,000 mAh battery that the company claims will last you "comfortably for almost two days with mixed use." The phone gets  33W fast charging, and reaches 50% in approximately 20 minutes, though this charger is sold separately.</p><p>The Phone 3a Lite gets a triple-camera array, with a primary 50MP lens  (with OIS/EIS), accompanied by an 8MP ultra-wide camera and a 2MP macro lens. It also has a 16MP selfie camera as well. Nothing says that the large 1/1.57-inch Samsung sensor captures 64% more light than typical sensors, ensuring high performance of these rear lenses.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qShmNoxgY7v48uEwMVmcjb" name="Nothing-Phone-3a-Lite" alt="Nothing Phone 3a Lite arrives" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qShmNoxgY7v48uEwMVmcjb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nothing)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Phone (3a) Lite gets Nothing OS 3.5 (Android 15) out of the box and comes with features like Essential Key, Private Space, and App Locker.

The post confirms that the device will arrive in the U.S. and Canada on November 13. While this is good news, OnePlus states consumers in these respective regions can expect a more detailed report about the phone's pricing in two weeks when it arrives.</p><p>The company will have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/@OnePlusTech">a global launch event</a> that's streamed live on its YouTube channel. In its promotional era, there's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oneplus.com/us/launch/oneplus-15">a small event</a> taking place for the OnePlus 15 on the company's main website for the U.S. (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oneplus.com/ca_en/launch/oneplus-15">Canada, too</a>). Consumers who subscribe on its main page can "receive an extra $50 off, or get a chance to win the OnePlus Pad 3 for FREE."</p><p>Fueling the hype, the OnePlus 15 features Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 SoC, as well as the company's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-oxygenos-16-arrives-as-a-software-that-truly-knows-you">OxygenOS 16</a> software. One of its more major highlights concerns its DetailMax Engine for photography. OnePlus says its new engine works to bring better true-to-life imagery taken through its available cameras.

While the phone rocks a 6.7-inch LTPO AMOLED display, there is a redesign for its camera array. The device features three lenses in a rounded, square housing, spearheaded by a 50MP primary sensor. Probably what's turning more heads is the phone's massive 7,300mAh battery.</p><p>OnePlus truly leaned into its Glacier Battery technology to bring a battery that beats its previous phone generations by a mile. This incredible battery's been paired with 120W fast-charging, meaning you're not only scrolling for longer, but your charging breaks are even shorter.</p><p>In China, the OnePlus 15 started at CNY 3,999 (~$562 USD), so that gives us an idea of what we <em>might </em>see when November 13 rolls around.</p><p>Also, the brand's major OxygenOS 16 is available on the newest model, as previously mentioned.

The tipster cites an "exclusive preview," before highlighting that the company is looking to roll out Pixel "Theme Packs" next month. Supposedly, the first-ever pack for Pixels will coincide with the upcoming Disney film, Wicked: For Good.</p><p>The leak suggests users can find this new Pixel Theme in the "Wallpapers & Styles" menu after long-pressing their home screen once this update arrives.</p><p>Elsewhere, another key highlight the post mentioned concerns "Pixel VIP notifications."</p><p>Mystic Leaks claims this feature is getting a little QoL, which now brings "prioritized" alerts for your set VIP contacts. However, they state that the feature is seemingly going to be limited to texts sent through Google Messages and WhatsApp first when this arrives. In the provided screenshot, rumors allege that notifications from your "Pixel VIPs" will be highlighted in yellow, and you'll also see their profile picture in your device's status bar.</p><p>The idea is to, of course, draw more attention to any Pixel VIPs you may have.</p><h2 id="thankful-for-updates-2">Thankful for updates?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1022px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.87%;"><img id="a77TH3fNMSHwkBCx2aWcqe" name="google-pixel-alleged-november-2025-drop-details" alt="A screenshot of some leaked details regarding Google's supposed November 2025 Pixel Drop, which could bring a new Pixel Studio update, Pixel VIPs, and a Pixel Theme." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a77TH3fNMSHwkBCx2aWcqe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1022" height="571" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Mystic Leaks / Telegram)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The final update that the tipster mentions is for the Pixel Studio. Supposedly, Google is preparing an update that Pixel users "breathe new life" into photos and GIFs. The alleged promotional material states that the Pixel Studio will give users the tools to turn their images into a GIF or an animated sticker. It seems the feature will gain an "animate image" button once inside.</p><p>The rumors conclude by stating Pixel users may see this major drop on November 4, which is just next week. Let's see what happens first before we set these rumors in stone.</p><p>Google's Pixels <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-drop-september-material-3-expressive-expansion-adaptive-audio">had a huge drop back in September</a>, an update that brought a Material 3 Expressive expansion. After hitting the company's more recent devices first, Android's newest design overhaul started rolling out for the Pixel 6 and Pixel Tablet. More than that, users found better customization for lock and call screens, as well as a new, sleek revamp for Quick Settings. Even the Pixel Buds Pro 2 got in on the fun, grabbing an Adaptive Audio update that adjusts your audio depending on your surroundings.</p><p>Testing-wise, we're wrapped up in Google's Android 16 QPR2 beta, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-rolls-out-bootloader-fix-in-android-16-qpr2-beta-3-1">as v3.1 rolled out a week ago</a>. That update was a rush order, as Google sought to correct a major bootloader looping issue that plagued Pixels trying to reach the original v3.0 update. Aside from the problems, QPR2 Beta 3 brought a few new features that testers can enjoy, alongside a host of Pixel fixes.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Me neither, but there are many folks who do, and <em>even more</em> folks who are hoping to buy the new Samsung Galaxy XR headset this holiday season. This guide will tell you how you can order your very own XR today, how you could possibly save some money on the purchase, and what all of it means for the state of mixed reality in 2025/2026. </p><p>The result of a longstanding collaboration between Samsung and Google, the Galaxy XR headset finally hit store shelves on October 21st. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-galaxy-xr-hands-on-impressions">We've already used the XR</a> a good bit, and it's clear that Apple and Meta have some new competition in the world of AR and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-vr-headsets">VR headsets</a>. </p><p>Just like the Vision Pro, Samsung's premium headset is more than just a gaming console, utilizing a Snapdragon chipset to give users the ability to surf the web, game, and stream their favorite content - all at the same time. And unlike the competition from Apple and Meta, Google has confirmed that all of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-apps">Android apps</a> in the Google Play store will be available to the Galaxy XR straight out of the box.</p><p>So how do you buy it? Well, as of writing, you can only buy the Galaxy XR headset directly from Samsung, and it'll cost you a pretty penny. Let's dive in. </p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-xr-deals"><span>Samsung Galaxy XR deals</span></h3><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="a848c351-a119-41c9-8a39-0ffb90a02178" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy XR Headset 256GB: $1,799.99 at Samsung" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy XR Headset 256GB: $1,799.99 at Samsung" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/xr/galaxy-xr/galaxy-xr/buy/galaxy-xr-256gb-silver-shadow-wi-fi-sm-i610nzsaxar/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="PLNBFvfigQSH4NpRjcJKy6" name="samsung-galaxy-xr-side-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PLNBFvfigQSH4NpRjcJKy6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy XR Headset 256GB: </strong><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-apps" data-dimension112="a848c351-a119-41c9-8a39-0ffb90a02178" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy XR Headset 256GB: $1,799.99 at Samsung" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy XR Headset 256GB: $1,799.99 at Samsung" data-dimension25=""><strong>$1,799.99 at Samsung</strong></a></p><p>At this time, you can only buy the Galaxy XR directly from Samsung. The headset costs $1,800, but if you order before the end of the year, you'll get a bunch of free stuff through the "Explorer Pack", such as a year of YouTube Premium alongside a year of Google AI Pro, NBA League Pass, Calm Premium, and more. </p><p>This package deal pretty much sets you up for a premium mixed reality experience straight out of the box, and while the price tag is still steep, hopefully the freebies can lessen the blow. </p><p>The big question now is whether we might see better <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025">Samsung deals</a> on the XR as we approach Black Friday. At this point it's too soon to say, but I wouldn't count on it unless the headset reaches other stores, such as Amazon and Best Buy, very soon. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/xr/galaxy-xr/galaxy-xr/buy/galaxy-xr-256gb-silver-shadow-wi-fi-sm-i610nzsaxar/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="a848c351-a119-41c9-8a39-0ffb90a02178" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy XR Headset 256GB: $1,799.99 at Samsung" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy XR Headset 256GB: $1,799.99 at Samsung" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-xr-faq"><span>Samsung Galaxy XR FAQ</span></h3><h2 id="what-is-the-samsung-galaxy-xr-2">What is the Samsung Galaxy XR?</h2><p>The result of a collaboration between Samsung and Google, the Galaxy XR is a next-generation mixed reality headset packed full of cutting-edge hardware and its own bespoke version of Android. </p><p>Unlike some VR headsets, which are primarily geared towards gaming, the XR is more like Samsung's answer to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/apple-vision-pro-launch-sales-success">Apple Vision Pro</a>, offering users the ability to enjoy entertainment, productivity, and social media apps all in one device (and at the same time). There's a reason we keep calling it a "laptop for your face". </p><p>The XR is designed to be comfortable enough to wear for hours on end, and the lack of required controllers means that the headset is easy to carry and use wherever you are. The XR comes equipped with the Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2, a considerably faster chipset than what's found in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Meta Quest 3</a>, while the 3552 x 3840 resolution display is one of the best we've ever seen in a headset. </p><h2 id="how-much-does-the-samsung-galaxy-xr-cost-2">How much does the Samsung Galaxy XR cost?</h2><p>The Galaxy XR headset costs $1,799.99 for the 256GB version, or around $75 per month if you pay through Samsung financing. That's obviously pretty expensive, but it's still way more affordable than the Apple Vision Pro, which starts at $3,499. </p><p>Your purchase of the Galaxy XR will also come with a protective cover, light shields, a battery pack, cables, and more, not to mention all of the free entertainment services included in the "Explorer Pack" detailed above. </p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="aJmgPPA92R2VBSsuJ8tjAN" name="Samsung-Galaxy-XR-pinch-controls" alt="A photo of the author wearing the Samsung Galaxy XR headset, holding up one hand in a pinch gesture." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aJmgPPA92R2VBSsuJ8tjAN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="should-i-wait-for-black-friday-to-buy-the-samsung-galaxy-xr-2">Should I wait for Black Friday to buy the Samsung Galaxy XR? </h2><p>It's unlikely that the Samsung Galaxy XR will appear in very many Black Friday or Cyber Monday sales this year, but you never know. It'll largely depend on whether or not traditional retailers like Amazon and Best Buy start carrying the device before the end of the year.</p><p>That being said, since Samsung's "Explorer Pack" offer is available until the end of the year, it couldn't hurt to wait a few weeks and see what happens as the Black Friday sales go live. Needless to say, I'll be updating this guide with any new deals as they go live, so feel free to check back later to see what's new. </p> ]]></dc:content>

Make sure to <a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=androidcentral.com"><strong>set Android Central as a preferred source</strong></a> in Google Search, and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should"><strong>find out why you should</strong></a> so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>It's been more than five years since Animal Crossing: New Horizons debuted, and that means fans are salivating for a new title to scratch the itch of collecting and socializing. Thankfully, the developers of Little Planet heard the call and are launching what feels like Animal Crossing VR on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s">Meta Quest platform</a> on October 30, 2025, for the crowd-pleasing price of free.</p><p>Just as in Animal Crossing, players start out making their own avatar, followed by selecting one of three islands to begin their journey on. Here, you'll be harvesting resources, building houses, making friends, and collecting over 4,000 items to decorate your world with. You can also sculpt the land to bring your vision to life.</p><p>Unlike Animal Crossing, items in Little Planet are interactive. Place a piano down in your house and you can actually play music on it. Drop a basketball hoop down and shoot hoops with friends. You can even ride inflatables in the water! That's one of my biggest complaints with the Animal Crossing series, and it's been solved here.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="E2cpMzb9jQoatd4AJKcA2C" name="little-planet-screenshot-04" alt="Playing with virtual pets in Little Planet on a Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/E2cpMzb9jQoatd4AJKcA2C.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1280" height="720" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qJmDd3jQkwwEaWjoSwFyzB" name="little-planet-screenshot-02" alt="Playing in Little Planet's Halloween world on a Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qJmDd3jQkwwEaWjoSwFyzB.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1280" height="720" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HUjJn4DAUGap7GAGTA4a2C" name="little-planet-screenshot-03" alt="Playing with virtual pets in Little Planet on a Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HUjJn4DAUGap7GAGTA4a2C.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1280" height="720" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>With the free-to-play launch version, Little Planet is debuting two huge new systems that transform the game: a virtual pet system, and a ton of new multiplayer features. Several different virtual pets can now be chosen from and will follow you around, begging for pets and treats. From abstract creatures to cute capybaras, the game likely has something you'll love to keep around for the long haul.</p><p>The new multiplayer lobby also makes it simple to find people in game and make new friends, join in seasonal festivities, and play a ton of new multiplayer-focused games. This lobby is a central way to socialize in the game, something that's not always easy to do in Animal Crossing.</p><p>I got to join the developers in the Halloween-themed area which, as you might imagine, changes regularly depending on the season or holiday. It's yet another area where the game improves over the classic Animal Crossing formula.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rz6gWctRDqq8RUdeMupb2C" name="little-planet-screenshot-01" alt="Checking out Little Planet's new multiplayer lobby on a Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rz6gWctRDqq8RUdeMupb2C.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1280" height="720" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The multiplayer games are a great way to change up the normal gameplay in fun ways, including a scavenger hunt, a giant maze, fishing contests, and more. As you might imagine, winning each of these games gives you in-game rewards that can be exchanged for items or special edition prizes that you can't collect otherwise.</p><p>Since the game has been in <em>paid</em> early access for two years, existing players who paid for the game will be getting rewarded for their support. The developers call this the Founders Pack and it includes a full year of the "Little Planet Premium" subscription, exclusive items for your planet, and a unique founder's hoodie and name tag that will never be available again.</p><p>If you haven't jumped onboard yet, you can still grab <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/little-planet-early-access/5749790791804399/">Little Planet Early Access for $20</a> on October 29 and get the full Founders Pack.

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The headlines since the Galaxy XR's launch have been pretty clear. Samsung's first Android XR-powered headset is fantastic, and it's being lauded as the more affordable Apple Vision Pro we've been asking for. But does that mean it's right for you?</p><p>That question depends entirely on what you plan to do with it, of course! Just like the Apple Vision Pro, Samsung and Google have posited that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-galaxy-xr">Galaxy XR</a> is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/how-the-samsung-galaxy-xr-headset-can-live-up-to-its-price-tag">for entertainment and productivity</a>, with a little sidecar of gaming attached.</p><p>That means if you're looking to work on your headset and want an infinite canvas of monitors surrounding you at all times, the Samsung Galaxy XR is the best way to achieve that goal. Similarly, if you regularly find yourself at home disinterested in what everyone else is watching or playing, Galaxy XR is a great way to kick back and see or play what you want without being kicked off the TV again.</p><h2 id="already-ahead-of-the-pack-2">Already ahead of the pack</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2721px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="QbgwEyfpF84F6a4jrZRpLY" name="Samsung-Galaxy-XR-press-photo" alt="A photo of Samsung Galaxy XR sitting on a podium at a 30-degree front-left angle." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QbgwEyfpF84F6a4jrZRpLY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2721" height="1531" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Galaxy XR has the best screen ever in a VR headset, packing in an incredible 29 million pixels in a pair of micro-OLED panels. These panels are powered by the Snapdragon XR2 Plus Gen 2 chipset and, since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a> runs the show, every single Android app on the Google Play Store works on the headset.</p><p>That means any streaming app, productivity app, or really any app at all can be found and used on the headset, so you don't need to wildly adjust your current habits to jump into Galaxy XR's amazing immersive views.</p><p>In fact, Galaxy XR is the <em>only</em> VR headset with an official Netflix app, so you get the full quality of every show and movie without worrying about browser compatibility or side-loading.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hmaaGjLYbWzSSwmJ5UbjZC" name="android-xr-google-tv-app-official" alt="Watching a movie on the Google TV app in mixed reality on Android XR" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hmaaGjLYbWzSSwmJ5UbjZC.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="400" height="225" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On top of that, it's easy to hook Galaxy XR up to a PC wirelessly with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=virtualdesktop.android">Virtual Desktop app</a>, or just natively hook up to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/samsungs-new-galaxy-book-5-lineup-boasts-ai-smarts-and-cross-device-connectivity">a Galaxybook laptop</a> with Samsung's built-in software. This way, you can not only work on your PC without hurting your neck (boy, do I hate looking down at a laptop for hours), but you also get the flexibility of multiple monitors, no matter where you are.</p><p>That means you can bring your laptop and headset with you on your next work trip and still feel like you're working at home. It also means long plane rides can be a way to relax and unwind with a giant virtual theater in front of you instead of a seat 15 inches from your face.</p><h2 id="a-vr-gaming-powerhouse-2">A VR gaming powerhouse</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="svTMKttnbw5fEBx84VPWuM" name="Galaxy-XR-Walkabout-Mini-Golf-VR" alt="A photo of a Samsung engineer playing Walkabout Mini Golf while wearing the Galaxy XR headset and using a Galaxy XR controller in her right hand, a screen showing the game behind her." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/svTMKttnbw5fEBx84VPWuM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1126" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>VR gamers will find that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Meta Quest 3</a> is a better buy for standalone VR games, as it has thousands of titles available through Meta's store. But PC VR gamers should seriously consider the Galaxy XR, as it's currently the best wireless headset for PC gaming.</p><p>That's because the Virtual Desktop app is able to pass Galaxy XR's face tracking, eye tracking, and hand tracking capabilities to your PC, allowing apps like VRChat to use this data to create more lifelike avatars. There's no other wireless VR headset on the market with this capability and power, making it the ultimate choice for wireless PC VR gaming enthusiasts.</p><p>Do you find yourself fitting into any of these three categories? If so, the Galaxy XR may just be the standalone headset you've been waiting for. It takes everything that was great about the Meta Quest Pro and improves upon it, delivering Apple Vision Pro-like visual fidelity with a new breakthrough in Android app support made possible by Android XR. It's a phenomenal solution for folks wanting the best of the best on the Android side of things.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="4727e0e6-82ca-4e79-bf8e-94ffa2677301">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:66.67%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cxXQANwssegypWVFB9SYcS.jpg' alt="Galaxy XR side profile"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy XR</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Cutting-edge hardware meets the best XR operating system ever made.

Object Eraser helps you remove unwanted items from your photos, and Generative Edit handles larger changes, but these features are found in separate spots. This can be confusing, but Samsung plans to fix it with the upcoming One UI 8.5 update.</p><p>Samsung may be overhauling its photo editing tools with One UI 8.5, and the core change is that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-use-object-eraser-samsung-phone">Object Eraser</a> is being merged into Generative Edit. Based on screen recordings from the new version, shared by leaker @tarunvats33 on X, the workflow will be streamlined (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sammyguru.com/one-ui-8-5-integrates-object-eraser-with-generative-edit/" target="_blank">SammyGuru</a>). Instead of bouncing between two separate tools, users will soon be able to remove unwanted objects and fill in the background in one seamless step.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">One UI 8.5: Object eraser has been integrated into generative edit. pic.twitter.com/E2LqSGp2U7<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1982410699398902058">October 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>In the current setup, Object Eraser sits as a standalone feature inside Samsung’s photo editor, allowing users to manually highlight and remove distractions from an image.</p><p>Generative Edit, on the other hand, uses AI to reconstruct missing parts of a photo or move subjects around realistically.</p><h2 id="seamless-workflow-2">Seamless workflow</h2><p>One UI 8.5 may blend these two into a single, smarter editing experience. When you open a photo and tap Generative Edit, you’ll now have direct access to erasing, filling, and reshaping tools without needing to switch tools.</p><p>Want to remove that stray photobomber? Just circle them as you would with Object Eraser. The tool will understand your intent, remove the object, and then it will instantly and intelligently fill in the background.</p><p>This integration is a part of Samsung's effort to make its AI-powered photo tools more intuitive and cohesive.</p><p>This change is expected to roll out officially with One UI 8.5, which will almost certainly make its debut on the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26</a> series early next year.

Weeks ahead of the big sale weekend, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Bowers-Wilkins-Headphones-Cancellation-Luxurious/dp/B0B33PXPJT/"><strong>Amazon is carving 26% off the elegant Bowers & Wilkins PX8 headphones, knocking the price down to $519.59</strong></a> for a limited time. </p><p>Bowers & Wilkins is widely-known for producing stylish, comfortable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">wireless headphones</a> that please audiophiles and casual listeners alike, whether you're immersing yourself in classical music, metal, or an action-packed video game. </p><p>At $699, however, the PX8 might be a bit too expensive for some folks. Thankfully, this early Black Friday deal is making the headphones much more accessible. Will the price drop further as we approach Black Friday and Cyber Monday? It's very possible, but this deal is worthy enough on its own if you don't want to wait until next month. </p><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><em><strong>See my guide to the best early Black Friday Samsung deals</strong></em></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="e095f2f9-5dd7-4523-9652-06a7a15a6967" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$699" data-dimension48="$699" href="https://www.amazon.com/Bowers-Wilkins-Headphones-Cancellation-Luxurious/dp/B0B33PXPJT/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="kye7FEiQjNSuPHfa29pPrk" name="Bowers-and-Wilkins-PX8-render-square" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kye7FEiQjNSuPHfa29pPrk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="400" height="400" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Bowers & Wilkins PX8:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bowers-Wilkins-Headphones-Cancellation-Luxurious/dp/B0B33PXPJT/" data-dimension112="e095f2f9-5dd7-4523-9652-06a7a15a6967" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$699" data-dimension48="$699" data-dimension25=""><del>$699</del> <strong>$519.59 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>The Bowers & Wilkins PX8 are among the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-noise-canceling-headphones">best noise-cancelling headphones</a> we've ever used, but they're far from cheap. Fortunately, Amazon has launched an early Black Friday deal that slashes 26% off the price of the luxurious cans, making them much more accessible for music lovers all over. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Bowers-Wilkins-Headphones-Cancellation-Luxurious/dp/B0B33PXPJT/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="e095f2f9-5dd7-4523-9652-06a7a15a6967" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$699" data-dimension48="$699" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want superbly detailed and balanced sound quality with excellent noise cancellation in a sleek, elegant package; you need headphones with great battery life. </p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you enjoy having lots of customization options and EQ settings with your headphones; you follow a vegan or plant-based lifestyle (the PX8 use leather in their construction).</p><p>The Bowers & Wilkins PX8 are stunning headphones inside and out, with outstanding ANC (active noise cancellation) capabilities, a versatile sound signature, and up to 30 hours of battery life on a single charge. With a Nappa leather and aluminum construction, the PX8 also look and feel like the height of luxury, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with other premium headphone brands like Bang & Olufsen. </p><p>Another standout feature is the headphones' USB-C port for audio, which lets you charge and listen to your favorite tunes without Bluetooth. The cans also come with a 3.5mm cable in the box. </p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="muRzxmtXs8dHgzAvoriuDi" name="Bowers-and-Wilkins-Px8-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Woman wearing Bowers & Wilkins Px8 headphones." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/muRzxmtXs8dHgzAvoriuDi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Bowers & Wilkins)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One thing that holds the Bowers & Wilkins PX8 back is the customization. Unlike the best headphones from Bose and Sony, the PX8 don't offer a ton of customization options in the companion app, which means you're limited to basic bass and treble control. The noise-cancellation also isn't very adjustable, which is a problem at this price point.</p><p>Fortunately, the headphones come with some pretty versatile default settings and excellent ANC support with passthrough, so it shouldn't be too much of an issue for most folks. That said, if you're an audiophile who likes to finetune your EQ settings, you may wish to look at other premium headphones, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/sony-wh-1000xm6-review">Sony WH-1000XM6</a>. </p><p>Needless to say, if you value great performance and sophistication in your devices, this headphones deal is a dream opportunity, no matter what you're listening to. Amazon is saying that stock is low, however, so I'd act fast if you're interested: miss this deal and you'll have to wait until Black Friday to score sweet savings.</p> ]]></dc:content>
