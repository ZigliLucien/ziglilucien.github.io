While many of the new changes have been well-received by users and beta testers, there's one exception: the split notification shade and quick settings panel.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/one-ui-7-delayed-because-software-is-hard">One UI 7</a> now behaves like iOS, with a notification shade that can be accessed by swiping down from the left corner of the screen and a separate quick settings panel on the right. For longtime One UI users, this could be a negative change that impacts muscle memory. The good news is that it's easy to reverse the split notification shade and quick settings panel to the unified panel. Let's find out how.</p>
<h2 id="all-the-notification-and-quick-settings-options-in-one-ui-7-2">All the notification and quick settings options in One UI 7</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZpGswcHfE36tUgcaFkrEF6" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-One-UI-7-Beta-2-split-notification-shade" alt="The new split notification pane on One UI 7 beta 2 on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZpGswcHfE36tUgcaFkrEF6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One UI 7 offers two customization options for the notification shade and quick settings panel: <strong>separate</strong> and <strong>together</strong>. Separate is now the default, with together still available as a manual option.</p><p>With the single notification shade and quick settings panel, you can view your most recent notifications and the top level quick settings toggles. There's also an option to edit the top quick settings so that your most-used toggles are easily accessible. To see them all, you can swipe down from the top quick settings one more time.</p><p>While you might expect the option to switch between these preferences to be in the Settings app, it's actually in the panel itself.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-change-back-to-a-single-notification-and-quick-settings-panel-2">How to change back to a single notification and quick settings panel</h2>
<p>1. <strong>Open the Quick Settings menu</strong> by swiping down from the top-right corner of the screen.</p><p>2. Press the <strong>Pencil</strong> icon.</p><p>3. Look for the <strong>Panel settings</strong> button at the top left of your screen, and tap it.</p><p>4. Under <strong>Panel settings</strong> options, tap <strong>Together</strong>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="K2kjttJmqNuQtH9VAqbq6Z" name="Quick-Settings-One-UI-Steps" alt="Steps for changing the Quick Settings menu's location." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/K2kjttJmqNuQtH9VAqbq6Z.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>After that, you'll now see your notification shade and quick settings menu on the same screen. This reflects how previous versions of One UI handled the two, so you're essentially reverting the new One UI 7 default.</p>

<p>Whether you simply prefer a unified notification shade and quick settings panel or are used to the old One UI defaults, there are plenty of reasons to change the One UI 7 preference. A single notification shade and quick settings panel is a One UI staple, and it's one of the things that separates <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung Galaxy phones</a> from iPhones.</p><p>Although some users might be unhappy with the switch, it's great that Samsung provides users with a choice between the two options. You can try out both the split and unified panel and choose the one that you like best on One UI 7.</p>

<hr>
<p>Early signs that Samsung's next watch line up have surfaced in a new leak. While we were focused on Samsung's upcoming foldable line up, the next-gen watches may have quietly passed safety checks.</p><p>Details surrounding batteries that are meant for the next Galaxy Watch 8 series' have allegedly received the SafetyKorea certification and in a separate leak, another tipster on X seems to have spotted firmware builds for these wearables, but more on this later. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.xpertpick.com/mobile/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-batteries-safetykorea-certification/">XpertPick</a>, the next generation of the Galaxy Watch will include two models: the Galaxy Watch 8 and the Galaxy Watch 8 classic.</p><p>First off, two batteries with the codenames <em>EB-BL330ABY and EB-BL505ABY</em>, have been approved by the SafetyKorea authority— as seen in the screenshots below. The publication seems to think that these batteries could be associated with the Galaxy Watch 8 and Galaxy Watch 8 Classic.</p><p>XpertPick also got its hands on the safety certification, indicating that Samsung has sent two products under "Fitness authentication" for safety and compliance certification.</p>

<p>A screenshot posted by XpertPick also spilled beans on the battery capacity of one of these wearables. "The TUV certification has revealed that the EB-BL330ABY battery has a typical capacity of 435mAh." However, we do not have any information on the battery size of the EB-BL505ABY variant.</p><p>Corroborating the fact that the Galaxy Watch 8 series will come as a pair, a user on X revealed information on the supposed firmware that will be built into these wearables. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/theordysm"><strong>Theordysm</strong></a> spotted model numbers <em>SM-L320, SM-L325U, SM-L330, and SM-L335U, </em>which could hint at the different size variants of the Galaxy Watch 8. While <em>SM-L500 and SM-L505 </em>could be associated with the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic variant.</p>

<p>This is the first time we've heard the mention of the Galaxy Watch 8 series in the rumor mill in quite some time. So far, all we've heard was that future Galaxy Watch models, such as the Watch 8, could be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/future-galaxy-watches-may-adopt-apple-watch-squircle-design">ditching the circular design</a> for a more Apple Watch-like squircle look.</p><p>We also sense that this year's watch could bring all the features that didn't make the cut on the Galaxy Watch 7 series, like the rumored blood-glucose monitoring that Samsung claimed to be developing "as early as the second half of 2024," despite previous reports that blood glucose monitoring <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-explores-non-invasive-glucose-monitor">would take a few years to arrive</a>.</p><p>That said, the new Galaxy Watch 8 series is expected to debut later this year along with Samsung's  Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Z Fold 7 at its summer Unpacked event, the publication added. While we wait, here's what we <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">wish to see</a> from the upcoming Galaxy Watch 8 series.</p>

<ul><li>Google confirmed Gemini Live's new video features won't be exclusive to the latest Android smartphones.</li><li>Project Astra capabilities merely require a device running Android 10 or higher.</li><li>Users will also need Gemini Advanced access, available for $20 per month.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google and Samsung marketed Gemini Live's new Project Astra features as coming to the latest Pixel and Galaxy phones first, but actual compatibility will work with a much wider set of Android devices. An updated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/15274899#:~:text=Share%20your%20camera%20or%20screen%20with%20Live" target="_blank">support document</a> from Google confirms that Gemini Live's video streaming and screen sharing features will work on any Android device running Android 10.0 or newer (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/04/01/gemini-live-camera-any-android/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>The features still require Gemini Advanced, which costs $20 per month as part of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One AI Premium subscription</a>. Aside from that requirement, there are no other limitations for the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini Live</a> features, which are rolling out to devices now.</p><p>"For now, the features below are available on any Android device with Gemini Advanced," the support document reads. "These features are being released gradually, so they might not be available to you just yet."</p><p>Reading between the lines, we can decipher that Gemini Live's video capabilities will work on Android phone, tablet, or foldable running Android 10.0 or higher. The Gemini Advanced requirement means that Android devices must support the Gemini app, which is limited to devices running Android 10 and up.</p>

<p>This includes a wide range of devices, meaning that Gemini's new Project Astra features aren't limited to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Samsung Galaxy S25</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Google Pixel 9 series</a>. With that being said, Google's "for now" qualifier in the support document suggests this could change in the future.</p>

<p>The upcoming Gemini Live features have already hit some Gemini Advanced users, but the rollout is slow thus far. Live video streaming and screen sharing support was first previewed as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/project-astra-joins-gemini-arm-as-google-gears-up-for-public-launch">Project Astra</a>, a research project demoed at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-biggest-announcements">Google I/O 2024</a>. Then, it underwent public beta testing at the end of last year, and a final version was shown off at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-centrals-best-of-mwc-2025">MWC Barcelona 2025</a>.</p><p>Soon, all Gemini Advanced users will be able to go live with Gemini, sharing their surroundings or device screen for additional context.</p>

<ul><li>Code references in the Google app for Android hint that Google could be working on a kid-friendly Gemini version.</li><li>Google already has guardrails in place for teens using Gemini.</li><li>These hints appear as Google rolls out new kid-friendly features, like Google Wallet for kids.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has been steadily rolling out new and improved versions of kid and parent-friendly features, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gives-family-link-a-new-look-and-plans-new-supervision-tools">a fresh look for Family Link</a>. The next Google service to get an experience optimized for children might be Gemini, the company's AI chatbot. According to an APK teardown by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-gemini-for-kids-apk-teardown-3540211/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, multiple code strings referenced a version of Gemini made for kids.</p><p>The code strings were spotted in <strong>version 16.12.39</strong> of the Google app for Android, which is where new Gemini features often appear before making their way to the Gemini app. The references include mentions of a welcome screen for kid users, as well as descriptions of key features. You can view the full code strings below:</p>
<pre class="line-numbers language-" language="" ><code><string name="assistant_scrappy_welcome_screen_title_for_kid_users">Switch to Gemini from Google Assistant</string>
<string name="assistant_welcome_screen_description_for_kid_users">Create stories, ask questions, get homework help, and more.</string>
<string name="assistant_welcome_screen_footer_for_kid_users">Google &lt;a href=%1$s&gt;Terms&lt;/a&gt; apply. Google will process your data as described in the &lt;a href=%2$s&gt;Google Privacy Policy&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=%3$s&gt;Gemini Apps Privacy Notice&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;b&gt;Gemini isn&amp;#8217;t human and can make mistakes, including about people, so double-check it.&lt;/b&gt;</string>
<string name="assistant_welcome_screen_title_for_kid_users">Meet Gemini, Google’s AI for everyone</string></code></pre>
<p>In particular, one string lists the description of Gemini for kids as helping them "Create stories, get homework help, and more." The strings also include standard notices that Gemini can make mistakes, and that kids' data will be processed per Google's privacy policy and Gemini's Apps Privacy Notice.</p><p>Although Gemini can already help kids with things like homework, it's likely that a future "Gemini for kids" version could include more guardrails and an experience tailored to children. Currently, Google already has certain safeguards in place for younger users, as explained in its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gemini.google/policy-guidelines/?hl=en" target="_blank">Gemini policy guidelines</a>.</p><p>"For teens, we enforce even stricter content policies and default protections to help prevent age-inappropriate content, such as content related to illegal or age-gated substances," Google says. "Teens are automatically onboarded to Gemini with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unPKJJjQP0A" target="_blank"><u>helpful video</u></a> that shares simple tips for using AI responsibly."</p><p>It's also possible that a "Gemini for kids" experience could be optimized for younger children than teens. For now, details are slim, as Google hasn't confirmed plans for a kid-friendly version of Gemini. However, it's worth noting that the company has rolled out many child-friendly features of late, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/kids-with-android-phones-can-now-tap-and-pay-with-google-wallet">Google Wallet for kids</a>.</p>

<p>Before that, Google and Samsung collaborated to make the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-and-google-teamed-up-on-new-galaxy-watch-7-experience-for-kids">Galaxy Watch for Kids</a> experience. On a similar note, Google sells the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-ace-lte-review">Fitbit Ace LTE</a>, a kid-friendly smartwatch.</p><p>As such, it wouldn't be a surprise for Google to make a version of Gemini just for kids.</p>

<p>Not all April Fool's pranks are a lost cause. OnePlus took this opportunity to tease its upcoming smaller phone set to join the OnePlus 13 line up, in an April Fools Day video.</p><p>In a post on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5150568143916360#&video">Weibo</a>, OnePlus seems to have confirmed that its long-rumored OnePlus 13T, or as most people call it, the OnePlus 13 Mini, will arrive "later this month."</p><p>OnePlus uploaded a video where it revealed a Thor-like hammer (Mjolnir) as its new product. The presenter seemed to have summoned the hammer on stage and explained its tech powers — obviously hopping on the April Fool's train.</p><p>However, at the end of the video, OnePlus seemingly teased its OnePlus 13T with a poster that shows the signature OnePlus red box and font that closely translates to "Small, beautiful and powerful OnePlus 13T, see you this month.”</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:50.00%;"><img id="Br8iZrzqJ74hAEc2AHWFsP" name="oneplus-13t-teaser-1" alt="screenshot of the OnePlus 13T teaser" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Br8iZrzqJ74hAEc2AHWFsP.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1800" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Weibo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Additionally, the caption of the video on Weibo states that the company will bring back the T-series device with "Top performance, in your hands." OnePlus added that the phone will be an "unprecedented technology product, refreshing your understanding of small and powerful!" This hints that the device could come packed with performance and AI features from the standard OnePlus 13 lineup.</p><p>While the video didn't show us what this device would look like, we have a some idea of what to expect based on recent leaks. Just last month, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/the-oneplus-13t-just-inched-closer-to-launch-with-fresh-details-surfacing">OnePlus 13T surfaced</a>, labeled as PKX110, but it only revealed that the device will come with 80W fast charging.</p>

<p>Other leaks suggest the device could sport a smaller 6.3-inch 1.5K flat OLED display and will be powered by<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite"> Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite </a>chip, along with a 6,000mAh battery, much like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>.</p><p>The device's cameras allegedly include a 50MP main sensor and a 50MP telephoto lens with 2x optical zoom. Details about the selfie camera are still unknown. However, the rear camera placement could shift into the vertical array this time around.</p><p>OnePlus is finally bringing back its T-series device after three years when the OnePlus 10T launched in 2022. While we aren't sure how much this phone will cost, it could fall somewhere in between the $600-$900 mark, based on the 13R and the OnePlus 13's cost.</p><p>While the company didn't reveal a launch date for this device, the announcement suggests that the wait won't be long, as the company could continue to drop more hints as the month progresses.</p>

<hr>
<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-22">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Several Google Pixel report threads state a few past-gen devices are suffering from inaccurate weather forecasts via the Pixel weather widget.</li><li>Users state the widget is displaying the correct temperature; however, the forecast throughout the day belongs to a previous day.</li><li>Some believe there's a desync issue that is simply not rectifying itself as users have suffered these issues for the past few days.</li><li>Following the March feature drop, Pixel users have suffered from various issues ranging from odd screen brightness to disappearing alarms.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google's weather widget is causing some confusion for Pixel users following a recent string of oddities.</p><p>As usual, Pixel owners took to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1jn30ns/how_many_others_are_getting_1day_old_weather/?rdt=51996">respective subreddit</a> to start voicing issues, which reportedly include day-old weather forecasts (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-pixels-weather-widget-stuck-in-the-past/">Android Police</a>). The issue seemed to be quite persistent for the original poster of the thread on Reddit; however, other subsequent user reports expand on it. One <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1jn30ns/comment/mkgs35i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">user responded</a> by saying their Pixel has been delivering inaccurate weather forecasts "for the past three days."</p><p>Another user, who also reported the issue a couple of days ago, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://old.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1jlu1uf/google_weather_at_a_glance_temperature_forecast/">states this issue</a> has been consistent on Pixels running Android 13, 14, and 15. Of course, this concerns devices with the "At a glance" weather information readily available. The user says the current temperature is correct, but "the expected high/low forecast hasn't been correct in the past week."</p><p>Then, strangely, opening the Pixel weather app fully displays everything as it should be. It's an odd back and forth between accurate temps to inaccurate forecasts, which only solve themselves when opening the full app.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1jlu1uf/google_weather_at_a_glance_temperature_forecast">Google Weather At A Glance Temperature Forecast - Never Accurate</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel">r/GooglePixel</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>Users have reported these issues on Pixel 7 devices and a Pixel 8a, as seen in a Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/334229425/pixel-8a-lock-screen-showing-weather-forecast-for-the-wrong-day?hl=en">community thread</a>. The post states the user had observed inaccurate weather forecasts, which showed the wrong day, on their lock screen. The user details the problem, stating, "In the morning, it shows yesterday's forecast as the temperature 'today,' and in the evening, it shows today's forecast as the weather 'tomorrow.'"</p><p>The problem doesn't appear to involve the Pixel 9 series, but you never know. It's something to keep an eye on as Google has yet to officially acknowledge the issue. As some users suspect, it <em>could </em>be an odd sync issue with the Pixel weather app widget. Hopefully, it begins to solve itself to avoid further confusion.</p>

<p>There's been no shortage of troubles for Google's Pixels as, following its March feature drop, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-owners-report-march-security-patch-problems">major issues have been appearing</a>. Pixel 7 to Pixel 9 series owners were reportedly suffering from brightness fluctuations, audio issues, and vibration problems following the big update. Google responded to those issues, stating it was aware and looking into the problem, as well as offering some temporary solutions.</p><p>Elsewhere, Pixel owners were <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-users-late-start-alarm-issues-reported">getting to a late start</a> last week as their alarms were deactivating themselves. Scheduled alarms were simply disappearing, leaving many users late for work without realizing their Pixel did it on its own. Some blame the March feature drop, while others think it was Gemini.</p><p>It's unclear if the same major patch is the culprit for the recent Pixel weather problems. There's a chance Google may have to fix some things on its end for those affected.</p>

<hr>
<p>A recent report suggests Samsung is looking into a new type of battery technology for its next smart ring.</p><p>A report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.mt.co.kr/mtview.php?no=2025040113515370007">Money Today</a> (Korean) claims Samsung will apply an "all-solid-state battery" technology inside the next Galaxy Ring (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sammyguru.com/samsung-plans-all-solid-state-batteries-for-wearables-like-galaxy-ring/">SammyGuru</a>). The publication states this tech, dubbed the "Dream Battery," consists of "solid electrolytes," which reportedly reduces the "risk of fire." However, there are two important sides to this type of battery. The first is positive, as all-solid-state batteries are said to hold more energy for devices.</p><p>In theory (and if true), this might give the next Galaxy Ring a longer battery life — though it can already last <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review#section-battery-and-charging:~:text=My%20Galaxy%20Ring%20lasted%206%2D7%20full%20days%20on%20any%20given%20charge.">roughly a week</a>. The report speculates that Samsung could take the battery's maximum energy capacity even higher when it looks to (potentially) bring it to the second Galaxy Ring.</p><p>The second is its application. Rumors claim that implementing this new battery technology into the next Galaxy Ring could drive up its cost. The post highlights that manufacturing such a battery is "much more" expensive than settling for a lithium-ion alternative. What's more, the poor performance of the Galaxy Ring sales-wise is supposedly a hurdle Samsung is still paying attention to when considering this battery type.</p>

<p>For now, Samsung is rumored to apply prototypes of this tech to the next Galaxy Ring "in the fourth quarter this year." Meanwhile, the report's alleged sources claim Samsung will also look to bring these dream batteries to earbuds in 2026 and a future Galaxy Watch in "late 2027."</p><p>Regarding Samsung's popularity concerns, when the Galaxy Ring launched last summer (July), the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-cant-ship-the-galaxy-ring-fast-enough-shows-how-theyre-an-in-thing">struggled to keep up</a> with demand. A report showed the Galaxy Ring sold out in just a few days prior to its official reveal/launch during Unpacked. When pre-orders opened again, the company had to deliver longer wait times for certain sizes as they weren't readily available. While this lasted for a few weeks during the summer, as the Korean publication highlights, it didn't last long.</p><p>As consumers got over the initial hype, and likely as more reviews came to light, things quieted.</p><p>Galaxy Ring 2 rumors have been scarce, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-ring-2-new-enhancements-launch-rumored">one claimed</a> in November that Samsung could provide it with an increased battery life and a thinner profile. It's remained unknown just how thin the ring could be next time. Elsewhere, it seems Samsung is looking to bring even more features to its next smart ring as the original may have felt a little lackluster.</p><p>It's also unclear when Samsung could debut <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-2">the next Galaxy Ring</a>; however, we're hopeful that something shows up during its summer Unpacked this year.</p>

<p>Google is highlighting a new challenge for users in London looking to take the tube throughout April.</p><p>Transport for London (Tfl) and Google Pay have joined together to bring the "Tube Challenge" to London. According to a press release, the event runs from March 31 through April 30. The company says users are eligible to win prizes and badges when using Google Pay for Android specifically. In a subsequent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://madeby.tfl.gov.uk/2025/03/31/google-pay-tube-challenge/">blog post</a>, the Tfl explains how users can get started this month.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started-2">Getting Started</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1197px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="eFDFBPhyetzjofs4GMQ4QJ" name="google-pay-tlf-london-tube-challenge-collect" alt="Google Pay joins the Tfl is bringing the "Tube Challenge" to users in London." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eFDFBPhyetzjofs4GMQ4QJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1197" height="673" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The post states users in London will have a chance to join the challenge from within Google Wallet. The Tfl encourages you to attach your Visa or Mastercard to the app "and start tapping in and out with Google Pay on your adventures."</p><p>These digital badges you're playing for will be collected as you tap to pay at various Tube stations. Google says travelers can collect these badges from all 272 Tube stations, including the 41 Elizabeth line stations. Alongside these badges are some fun facts about every station you may visit.</p><p>That's not all; as Google states train riders engaging with Google Pay for the Tube challenge are also entered into a weekly competition to win Santander Cycles Day Passes. However, during the final week, users tapping in and out of London stations will be eligible to win a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Google Pixel 9</a>. Remember: you earn an entry into these two raffles every day you take the Tube and engage with Google Pay.</p>

<p>In a statement, the customer director at the Tfl, Emma Strain, said, "We are excited to partner with Google Pay on their ‘Tube Challenge’ within Google Wallet. This innovative challenge offers customers a fun and engaging way to explore the Tube and Elizabeth line network, collect digital station badges, and learn facts about the places they are travelling to across London."</p><p>It's worth remembering that the Google Pay app — on its own — is no more, as the company shuttered it and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-supports-42-additional-banks">packed it into Google Wallet</a>. The app was officially shuttered as of June 4, 2024. The idea of paying via Google Pay still exists as its core functions are within Google Wallet. Additionally, places will still say they accept payment via the method, so it's not gone; it's just been moved.</p><p>To get people ready, Google brought support for a host of banks to its Wallet app early last year. Many of them were small banks, but the idea was likely to include as many of its users as possible to make the transition smooth. Since then, the company (in the U.S.) has moved to bring <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-to-expand-digital-drivers-license-support">digital ID support for state IDs</a>.</p><p>California <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-adds-digital-id-support-in-yet-another-us-state">joined the movement</a>, as well as Arizona, Georgia, and a few others.</p>

<p>Surely destined to earn a spot among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best cheap Android phones</a> released this year, the Samsung Galaxy A36 5G impresses with a stunning 6.7-inch AMOLED display that boasts a 120Hz refresh rate, while the 5,000mAh battery will easily last a full day on a single charge. </p><p>You&apos;ll also enjoy solid performance from the Exynos chipset, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a>, and a pared-down version of Galaxy AI (known as "Awesome Intelligence", per Samsung). Furthermore, the Galaxy A36 5G comes with six years of guaranteed software updates, which is a first for Samsung&apos;s budget-minded A series. </p><p>Priced in between Samsung&apos;s flagships and even-cheaper models like the Galaxy A16, one could argue that the A36 5G suffers from a bit of middle child syndrome. After all, if you&apos;re willing to spend a bit more, you could get an arguably better phone like the OnePlus 13R, the upcoming Pixel 9a, or even the Galaxy S25 (with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-deals-of-the-month">right phone deal</a>). But if you&apos;re already a fan of Samsung&apos;s bestselling A series and you want a new phone right away, this deal could get you exactly what you need (plus a free gift card to boot).</p>

<ul><li>New leak purports that the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge will launch this month.</li><li>The information comes from a Dutch website that also showcased model numbers for different storage variants of the device.</li><li>The publication was able to track down accessories that are being prepped for the sleek Galaxy phone that seems to be on everyone's mind.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-teaser">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge</a> has been at the centre of several leaks recently and for good reason, it looks like. A Dutch website seems to have gotten its hands on when this device could potentially see the light of day.</p><p>According to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nieuwemobiel.nl/041212/24519/Exclusief-Dit-is-de-lanceerdatum-van-de-Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge.html">NieuweMobiel.NL</a> (Netherlands website), the sleek phone will allegedly launch on April 15 in Europe — a day earlier than what the previous leaks have been pointing to. Additionally, the publication stated that the phone will be released in three colorways and two storage variants while also listing their supposed model numbers:</p><p><em>256GB Silver: SM-S937BZSD</em></p><p><em>512GB Silver: SM-S937BZSG</em></p><p><em>256GB Black: SM-S937BZKD</em></p><p><em>512GB Black: SM-S937BZKG</em></p><p><em>256GB Blue: SM-S937BLBD</em></p><p><em>512GB Blue: SM-S937BLBG</em></p><p>According to NieuweMobeil.NL, all S25 Edge models come with 12GB of RAM, similar to the rest of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 series</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GqsKf64SdjS5S3RWb4DWAD" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-Colorways" alt="Titanium colorways of Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GqsKf64SdjS5S3RWb4DWAD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WinFuture)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Recently, we got a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/new-leak-shows-off-samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-in-titanium-variants" target="_blank">good peek</a> at those colorways as official-looking renders popped up on the internet. They show off the Galaxy S25 Edge in a Titanium build and the three colors that match the Galaxy S25 Ultra: "Titanium Jet Black," "Titanium Silver," and "Titanium Icy Blue."</p><p>Samsung wasn't being too secretive about the upcoming addition to the S25 series since it openly showed off the device first at this year's Unpacked and later more vividly at the MWC in Barcelona, where the phones were hung from the ceiling suspended by metallic ropes.</p><p>We now know what the phone will look like, however when it comes to the specs of the phone, here's what we know so far. To start, the Galaxy S25 Edge is said to be 5.84mm thin, showcasing a titanium body and an Armor Aluminum frame. The phone could have a 6.7-inch QHD+ dynamic AMOLED display powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset</a>.</p><p>Additionally, it is said to come with a smaller 3,900mAh battery compared to the rest of the Galaxy S25 series (with some rumors pointing to a 4,000mAh unit), although we won't know for sure until it launches.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4093px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="AbNKAdLaHp9MFRMAf8UzE4" name="Samsung-GAlaxy-S25-Edge-MWC-2025-3" alt="The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge on display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AbNKAdLaHp9MFRMAf8UzE4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4093" height="2302" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As seen in several images, the phone will have two rear cameras. They will likely consist of a primary 200MP lens and a 12MP lens for ultra-wide shots, along with a selfie camera, which we don't have much information about.</p><p>When it comes to protecting these expensive phones, the Dutch website dropped some images of accessories that the Korean OEM is expected to release. The news website was able to find two Galaxy S25 Edge cases — a silicone case and a Kindsuit Case that showcased several color variations, with their supposed model numbers: <strong>Samsung EF-PS937CJ Silicone Case S25 Edge Gray </strong>and <strong>Samsung EF-VS937PL Kindsuit Case S25 Edge Blue</strong>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1172px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:85.32%;"><img id="L8ocQeeJgw4gUhRNL7jr4N" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-Cases" alt="Cases of the alleged Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/L8ocQeeJgw4gUhRNL7jr4N.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1172" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: NieuweMobiel.NL)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We also hear that the phones could be on the expensive side, with the 256GB model costing €1,200–€1,300 ($1,300–$1,400), while the 512GB version might hit €1,300–€1,400 ($1,400–$1,520).</p><p>As we near launch, the leaks seem to be coming in hot. However, it is important to note that everything we see in leaks may or may not show up on the actual device. If the Dutch website's information holds true, then the wait isn't for much longer.</p>

<p>As I pulled the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra out of my pocket, an unfamiliar friction met my fingers. This wasn't the matte glass texture that I'm used to feeling from Samsung's latest flagship. No, instead, was it the coarse texture of a brush or, dare I suggest it, <em>turf grass</em>?</p><p>Indeed, it was the feeling of the latest DBrand skin drop, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://dbrand.com/touch-grass"><strong>Touch Grass</strong></a>, which allows you to place your very own little field of dreams on your favorite device. The company says over 100 devices are supported for this limited edition drop, and while it is an April Fool's joke of sorts, DBrand is actually selling this limited edition set of skins to willing customers (so get it while it lasts!).</p><p>Given how much I've loved Dbrand's previous limited edition drops — like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/dbrand-leather-skin-review">the leather one</a> — I couldn't pass up the opportunity to touch grass and see how it felt, so I got a pack for a few phones in my possession and hastily installed them. If you're a nerd who's ever been told to "touch grass," this might be the perfect opportunity without having to go outside to do it.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9gKi4p9Df2nQKZsMGQHYbf" name="dbrand-grass-skin-2025-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-05" alt="The green Touch Grass DBrand skin on the back of a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9gKi4p9Df2nQKZsMGQHYbf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Despite the unique texture, the DBrand Touch Grass skin installs the same way as any other DBrand skin. You'll use the included microfiber cloth to wipe off any grease or smudges on the back of your phone, peel off a portion of the 3M paper on the back of the grass skin, align it with the camera modules, and then slowly peel back the rest of the 3M paper as you press the skin's adhesive back onto the phone's glass surface.</p><p>Unlike some of the full-coverage skins, the Touch Grass skin doesn't require a hair dryer for application. Instead, you'll just use the included microfiber cloth to rub the edges 15-20 times until they "melt" into the edge. This works particularly well with any phone that has a flat back and a slightly raised lip around the edge, as it'll help conceal the edge of the skin so you don't accidentally peel it off with a fingernail.</p>

<p>The skin is thicker than most DBrand skins because of the raised grass texture, which comprises thousands of electrostatically flocked polyethylene strands. Dbrand told me that flocking — a process that "shoots hyper-thin strands into adhesive and has them stand up like actual grass" — was the only method the company could find to fit the vision for the product properly.</p><p>"There were definitely 'fuzz' alternatives that we took one look at and abandoned. They were more akin to moss than they were actual strands of grass," DBrand CEO Adam Ijaz told me.</p>

<p>A mixture of green and yellow colors scattered throughout gives it a strangely natural look on the back of a wholly synthetic device, and it adds some <strong>serious</strong> grip to an otherwise slippery glass and metal sandwich of a phone.</p><p>The coarse grass texture reminds me quite a bit of one of those little brushes you use to clean the underside of your fingernails. It's not unpleasantly coarse but it does have a texture that could be irritating to sensitive skin. This isn't soft, natural spring grass. Thankfully, DBrand has ensured that it's a dry-feeling texture, not the slimy plastic you might be familiar with when you hear "turf grass."</p>

<p>As it has a significantly grippier texture than matte glass, this one will hold fast in your pocket even if you decide to do a handstand. How do I know that? I did it, of course. It'll also probably make your pocket go inside out every time you pull it out, especially if you wear shorts or pants with mesh pockets.</p>

<p>So this skin can finally make phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro</a> <em>not slippery</em>, but what else can it do? Eliminate wobble on phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>. One of the worst smartphone trends in recent years is the obnoxiously large camera lenses that are placed off-center on the back of phones. That makes them wobble when you put them down on a table.</p><p>But this skin completely fixes that, and it even makes it so the phone doesn't slide off a slightly slanted surface. As you might expect, adding the Touch Grass skin will make it impossible to use a case with your phone. If this is a concern, DBrand has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://dbrand.com/shop/grip">its own line of cases</a> that are built to be used with its skins, as you'll put the skin <em>on the case</em> instead of your phone.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-vegan-leather-phones">I hate glass phones</a>. I'm not sure what genius thought covering a smartphone in breakable glass was a good idea, but here we are. Sure, it made things like waterproofing and wireless charging easier for a time, but those days are behind us, and I hope to see more phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> that recognize this.</p><p>Motorola's entire lineup, from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-2025-review" target="_blank">$200 Moto G 2025</a> to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review" target="_blank">$999 Motorola Razr Plus 2024</a>, is clad in different grades of "vegan leather." Vegan leather can be made of anything from pieces of plastic to cactus leaves, each base material giving the final product a different texture. Phones like the Spring Green Razr 2024 or the Midnight Ocean OnePlus 13 use a very soft, cloth-like texture that feels less like leather and more like a suede shoe.</p><p>I definitely prefer that sort of smooth texture as it not only provides much-needed grip to modern phone designs but also removes a breakable surface. These phones don't use some kind of skin adhered to a layer of glass. Instead, this texture is factory-applied to a non-glass backplate and tucked behind the side frame, ensuring it will never peel off. These have also proven to be just as durable, if not more durable, than glass over time, earning phones like the OnePlus 13 a rare IP69 water and dust ingress rating.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Manufacturers are finally ditching glass and using interesting textures like vegan leather that have proven more durable over time.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>As for DBrand's limited edition Touch Grass skin, Ijaz ensured me that it was made for daily wear and tear.</p><p>"The biggest one was definitely around durability - especially at the edges. Early in development, we found that our traditional die-cutting method produced clean lines but led to grass strands gradually shedding from the edges (think: receding hairline).</p><p>To solve this, we switched to laser cutting. The laser's heat effectively melts (cauterizes) and seals the polyethylene strands at the perimeter, bonding them together to prevent shedding over time. Additionally, embedding each strand securely into an adhesive base layer (covering about 25% of its height) was critical in ensuring long-term stability. Balancing the novelty factor with real-world usability was an interesting challenge, but we're pleased with how well it turned out."</p><p>Of course, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/late-2024-led-flicker-research-smartphones">with some other things</a>, some of the biggest brand names simply aren't doing anything interesting in this area. The bright side is that if you've got an iPhone, Samsung Galaxy, or Google Pixel phone, you can order a DBrand skin to mostly fix this problem. It might still be glass underneath, but at least the outside won't feel like a slippery, breakable surface anymore when you slap a skin on it.</p>

<h2 id="dbrand-s-april-fools-legacy-2">Dbrand’s April Fools’ legacy</h2>
<p>Dbrand has a history of using April Fools’ Day to drop some pretty wild ideas, and today’s launch is no different. Back in 2022, the company introduced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://dbrand.com/shop/limited-edition/diy-kit?srsltid=AfmBOoqXq7VEa_Ruaow8WjNWKKwej2UJ_Xor2Bd5MXUGDTJ8xCiMi6fA" target="_blank">DIY skins</a>, letting people cut their own vinyl wraps. The "Deluxe" kit came with a 2x3 vinyl sheet, some fancy Japanese tools (a ruler and a knife), and a nearly $100 price tag. Meanwhile, the budget-friendly "Classic" version was just a tiny 1x1 vinyl square for $25. It was perfect for covering, well, not much.</p><p>As for the new grass-like skins, Dbrand says they were actually supposed to drop last April, but making fake grass feel real at a microscopic level turned out to be way harder "than coming up with the product name."</p><p>Bringing this concept to life wasn’t easy, as per the company's press release. Dbrand had to figure out how to electrostatically apply polyethylene fibers and cut them cleanly without making a mess.</p>
<h2 id="remember-that-creepy-skin-phone-case-2">Remember that creepy skin phone case?</h2>
<p>Speaking of weird phone cases, researcher Marc Teyssier from Télécom ParisTech created <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://marcteyssier.com/projects/skin-on/" target="_blank">Skin-On</a> back in 2019. It was a creepy but fascinating touch interface that felt like human skin.</p>

<p>This unsettling innovation lets phones, wearables, and touchpads react to different kinds of touch, making interactions a little too lifelike. The prototype responded to both pressure and touch sensations, but it never made it to market.</p><p>On the other hand, Dbrand takes these wild ideas and turns them into real products—like the Doomsday Kit and The DIY Project. While their approach is full of satire, it leads to actual, purchasable items.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-47">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google Maps is streamlining trip details, making the interface cleaner and more focused on key information.</li><li>The ETA now pops up bigger and bolder in a split, left-aligned display, making it the star of the show.</li><li>The redesign is live across all transport modes in version 25.13.06, but it’s server-side, so your experience might differ.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google Maps is tightening up the way trip details show up on screen, making everything cleaner and packed with just the right information.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/31/google-maps-directions-redesign/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a> has spotted a new design in the directions overview, where the color-coded ETA now pops up bigger on a split, left-aligned display. This makes that key information stand out more.</p><p>Before the update, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/15-best-google-maps-tips-and-tricks-you-need-know">Google Maps</a> crammed all your trip details—including time and distance—into three tight lines at the bottom of the screen. Both the hours and miles got the same plain text treatment, while half the space sat empty like unused trail.</p>
<h2 id="eta-gets-the-spotlight-2">ETA gets the spotlight</h2>
<p>The redesign gives the interface a modern feel with a cleaner information layout. While the distance is still there, it takes a backseat, making room for extra details like the ETA. Now, users can easily see things like fuel efficiency and, most importantly, their expected arrival time.</p><p>Previously, on Android, Google Maps gives a quick look at distance and travel time affected by traffic in the overview. To see more information, like parking or toll costs, you have to either expand the overview or tap the menu. But that’s changing with this update.</p>

<p>The visual redesign rolls out across all transport modes in Google Maps, starting with version 25.13.06. While 9to5Google reports a broad rollout, it’s still activated server-side, so the experience may vary for different users.</p><p>Sure, the new layout takes some getting used to. But comparing the old and new designs shows a clear appreciation for Google's improved look. At the end of the day though, we're all just along for the ride - it's not like Google is giving us a vote in the redesign.</p>

<hr>
<p>Caught you off guard; Nothing is announcing a brand new product reveal that'll give you a bit of nostalgia.</p><p>Today (Apr. 1), Nothing unveiled its latest audio product for its Ear lineup dubbed the Ear 3.5mm. If you've ever felt like you wanted to take a step back to wired earphones that deliver unparallel sound, this could be for you. The Nothing Ear 3.5mm features a jack for its respective port on your smartphone or other eligible device.</p><p>Additionally, the device is boasts Nothing's "signature style" for the in-ear part. Users will notice the company's expected transparent design, as well as a large hoop that's meant to go around your ear to ensure it remains in place. Amazingly, the Nothing Ear 3.5mm features a generous 50mm cable, which means you can get a load of housework done while staying connected.</p><p>Nothing ends its reveal with the tagline "Uninterrupted, untangled, unbelievable freedom."</p>

<p>Nothing didn't provide a market release date nor any information on pre-orders for the Ear 3.5mm —<em><strong>because this isn't a real product! April Fools! </strong></em></p><p>Aside from calling its latest product "beautifully inconvenient," it might've seemed odd that Nothing would — out of nowhere — offer an incredibly lengthy cord attached to the base of its Ear Open.</p><p>If you're looking for some "real" earphones, Nothing's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/nothing-ear-open-review">Ear Open</a> buds launched last fall (don't worry, they're wireless) and flaunted a different approach to the earphone design. Nothing opted for an "open" approach to the earbuds, which feature a wide ear loop, designed to go over your ears, not inside. Despite that, Android Central's Tshaka Armstrong said in his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/nothing-ear-open-review">review</a> that the buds surprisingly feature quite a bit of bass.</p><p>In other news, the Nothing OS 3.1 update <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-phone-3a-3a-pro-essential-key-update-3-1">is rolling out</a> for the  Phone 3a and 3a Pro which adds a major feature to Essential Key. It now works with the camera app, letting users directly save photos to their Essential Space with written or voice notes.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-57">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google could be working on a home screen widget for the Pixel Screenshots app.</li><li>The widget, in its early form, will only display your latest screenshot on the home screen for quick access to sharing or editing.</li><li>Right now, the widget is pretty basic—just one screenshot with no customization or resizing options.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is reportedly working on a home screen widget for the Pixel Screenshots app, which uses AI <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-the-pixel-screenshots-app-on-the-google-pixel-9">to organize and search your screenshots</a>.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-screenshots-widget-3539965/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, the Pixel Screenshots app might soon get widget support. In its early version, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Google Pixel 9</a>-exclusive widget would show your latest screenshot right on the home screen. You’ll be able to tap on it to share or edit the image directly.</p><p>The widget is pretty limited for now, though. It just shows one screenshot with no options for customizing the content. You can’t resize it either. Its description, "See the latest screenshot and [its] associated action," really highlights how it's all about quick, fixed access.</p>

<h2 id="more-than-just-storing-screenshots-2">More than just storing screenshots</h2>
<p>For those who haven't come across it yet, the Pixel 9-exclusive Pixel Screenshots is an app that turns your screenshots into something useful. First shown off at the 2024 Made by Google event, it’s since been integrated with various Google apps, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-screenshots-circle-to-search-development-spotted">such as Circle to Search</a>, Gboard, and Google Wallet.</p><p>Thanks to Google's Gemini Nano AI, the app automatically sorts through your screenshots and actually understands what's in them. That means you can search for text, dates, or even specific details across all your saved images.</p><p>Despite this discovery, the latest version of the Pixel Screenshots app doesn’t yet support widgets. However, it’s likely that a future update will bring widget support, along with more features and customization options.</p><p>Even without the widget, the Pixel Screenshots app does more than just store images. Its AI pulls out key data—like text, timestamps, and important details—and organizes them into collections that you can easily manage, filter, or add to.</p>

<ul><li>Google will launch a new battery preservation feature, Battery health assistance, later this year.</li><li>The Google Pixel 9a is the only device currently confirmed to be getting the new feature.</li><li>New devices will be required to use Battery health assistance, but it'll be optional for existing ones.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-9a-finally-gets-a-launch-date-">Google's Pixel 9a will hit shelves April 10</a>, packing a significantly-larger battery capacity than its predecessor. However, that's not the only battery upgrade the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a">Pixel 9a</a> brings along. The Google Pixel 9a will also receive with a new feature called "Battery health assistance," as explained by a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/15738128?hl=en" target="_blank">support document</a> linked on its Google Store listing (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/31/pixel-battery-health-assistance/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>"Your Pixel 9a will receive a software update that automatically helps manage the long term health and performance of its battery as it ages," the company explains. "This software will adjust the battery’s maximum voltage in stages that start at 200 charge cycles and continue gradually until 1000 charge cycles to help stabilize battery performance and aging."</p><p>For those that are unfamiliar, Pixel phones — like most electronics — use lithium-ion batteries that are consumable components. That means they will degrade over time due to a number of factors, including temperature, charge cycles, and age. Eventually, all lithium-ion batteries will need to be replaced.</p><p>There are steps that can be taken to preserve the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-check-android-phone-battery-health">long-term health of your phone's battery</a> and overall performance, though. These can include intentionally throttling a device's performance to accommodate battery degradation as it gets older, or limiting charge speeds and maximum charge levels. Battery health assistance will join the ranks of battery-preserving features in a later update, Google says.</p>

<p>"You may notice small decreases in your battery’s runtime as your battery ages," the company writes. "Battery health assistance will also tune the phone’s charging speed based on adjusted capacity. You may notice a slight change in battery charging performance."</p><p>For now, the Pixel 9a is the only device confirmed to get this feature when it launches later this year. However, it's expected to come to more devices. These features aren't user-customizable.</p><p>"Battery health assistance is a software feature that will roll out to a selection of Pixel devices starting later this year, designed to extend their usability," Google told 9to5Google in a statement. The company also said Battery health assistance "will be voluntary for any customers using previously launched devices."</p><p>This feature isn't available now, and doesn't have a set release date. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> is expected to bring along a<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/pixel-phones-might-finally-introduce-battery-health-feature-with-android-16"> few other battery health tools for Pixels</a> later this year.</p>

The team is sprinting, TPUs are running hot, and we want to get our most intelligent model into more people’s hands asap.

Which is why we decided to roll out Gemini 2.5 Pro (experimental) to all Gemini users, beginning today.

Try it at no… https://t.co/eqCJwwVhXJ<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1906131622736679332">March 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>There are still crucial advantages for Gemini Advanced subscribers. Google says that rate limits will apply to free Gemini users, whole Gemini Advanced users "have expanded access and a significantly larger context window." For now, Gemini 2.5 Pro experimental has a one-million-token context window that will double in the future. These features are available as part of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One AI Premium subscription</a>, which costs $20 per month.</p><p>Gemini 2.5 Pro launched at the top many of the benchmarks and leaderboards for large language models (LLMs), including LMArena, where it is still the top-ranking chatbot as of today. Google originally explained that it developed Gemini 2.5 Pro by "combining a significantly enhanced base model with improved post-training."</p>

<p>Presumably, Google wants to get Gemini 2.5 Pro experimental — its best AI model yet — in the hands of more users. While still an experimental model, Gemini 2.5 Pro has support for file uploads, extensions, and Canvas. It currently lacks a few features, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/deep-research-could-be-the-next-gemini-feature-to-hit-free-users-per-report">Deep Research</a> mode.</p><p>It's unclear whether the final version of Gemini 2.5 Pro will also be made available to free users in a limited fashion.</p>

<p><em><strong>Phil writes:</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Would you explain what an international version phone is and what some of the benefits and main consequences may be if purchased? Or is it simply a pass?</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Thanks in advance,</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Phil</strong></em></p>
<p>Hi Phil. This is a great question on two fronts, and I'm really glad you asked. It gives a chance for some useful information to be written, and it reminds people like me that not everyone is techy enough to know what all this stuff means.</p><p>For people who just want the answer, an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/ultra-mobile-review" target="_blank">international phone</a> is one designed to work in most countries around the globe. That used to be a bigger deal when phone carriers like Verizon and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/t-mobile-reaches-major-merger-milestone-officially-retires-sprint-brand" target="_blank">now-defunct Sprint</a> had non-compatible networks and charged extra for special phones that worked on them, but nowadays, it matters less.</p><p>Read on for more details.</p>

<h2 id="an-international-phone-can-mean-different-things-2">An "International phone" can mean different things</h2>
<p>If you were to ask me in a casual conversation, I'd give the answer above, but you might see other ways the words <em>international phone</em> are used, depending on where you look.</p><p>An international phone can be one designed for use in many countries around the globe. It can also mean an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-unlocked-phone" target="_blank">unlocked phone</a> so you can put a different SIM card in it that is local for other countries. It can even mean a phone sold with a service plan that allows for sending and receiving calls across international borders. The last meaning is most popular for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-prepaid-cell-phones">prepaid phones</a>.</p>
<p>The phone's ability to make calls and use data depends on the modem inside it. Every carrier uses specific frequencies and tech to handle calls and data, and any equipment, like a phone, designed to be used with a carrier has to support those, or it's not going to work very well or at all.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xskHMTNsDeoUaW9jxDHrfS" name="oneplus-12-with-google-pixel-9-pro-xl-in-background" alt="The green OnePlus 12 in front of a grey Google Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xskHMTNsDeoUaW9jxDHrfS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Most phones sold today can handle enough different radio bands to cover plenty of those frequencies and will work on many networks around the world. It didn't used to be that way, and even today, not all phones will work in all places.</p><p>This <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/talk-mobile/whenever-wherever-why-you-cant-use-any-phone-on-any-carrier-talk-mobile">mattered a lot</a> just a few years ago. If you bought a phone from a carrier in the U.S. it <em>probably</em> wasn't going to work in Germany or Nigeria, for example. That's because the tech inside the phone's chip wasn't as advanced and couldn't handle that many different bands or because a carrier wanted to ensure you were locked in with a phone that only worked with them. Samsung's Galaxy models were notorious for this, with capable hardware deactivated at the behest of a phone carrier.</p><p>It's less of a thing today, thankfully. Chances are, any unlocked phone (one not tied to a specific carrier) is going to work in most places. Some countries like the U.S. and China still use specialized network tech, but unlocked phones can still use a portion of the network.</p>
<h2 id="drawbacks-2">Drawbacks</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vBJsLpu2HdkkTFV4avmuSi" name="visible-sim-card-passport-hero.jpeg" alt="Visible SIM card sitting on top of US passport" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vBJsLpu2HdkkTFV4avmuSi.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There is one big drawback you need to consider. It has nothing to do with how the phone operates, though.</p><p>Depending on where you buy it, an unlocked international version of a phone won't come with any sort of warranty. Someone once asked me about this, and my response was, "Can you fix it yourself if it breaks?" If the answer is no, I'd suggest not buying it. Phones are mass-produced by the millions, and there <em>will</em> be lemons. If you end up with one and don't have any sort of warranty, you're stuck.</p><p>Other than that, it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/galaxy-s20-snapdragon-865-vs-exynos-990">mostly the same</a> phone as the model made specifically for your region. Most people want one because the phone is usually SIM unlocked and can be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-is-android-bootloader">bootloader unlocked</a> so that custom firmware can be loaded onto it.</p>
<p>In essence, an unlocked phone is a device capable of being used in different countries and isn't hard to find if you want one.</p><p>You probably don't need one because your phone will work. All you need to do is ask your phone carrier to be sure. If you do buy one, remember you probably don't have any sort of warranty to fall back on if things go sour.</p>

<hr>
<p>The Garmin Vivoactive 6 has arrived as the latest "mainstream" watch for frugal athletes who can't afford the Venu 3. And while it does have software upgrades, the hardware is <em>quite</em> similar to the Vivoactive 5.</p><p>Both have an identical 42.2mm case size, 36g weight with strap, 1.2-inch AMOLED touch display with 325 PPI, 11-day battery life, and 17 hours of all-systems GNSS tracking.</p><p>The Vivoactive 6 does measure 0.2mm thinner, which we appreciate, and it has a new main button that's elevated and more compact than the last generation, hopefully making it easier to press.</p><p>Unfortunately, this watch has the same Elevate v4 sensors, with accurate heart rate, HRV, stress, blood oxygen, and sleep data, but no ECG or skin temperature readings like the 2023 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review">Venu 3</a>. Given that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-cant-decide-if-the-garmin-instinct-3-is-a-triumph-or-a-letdown">Instinct 3</a> also stuck to last-gen sensors, the cheaper Vivoactive 6 wasn't likely to upgrade, either. But it's still disappointing.</p>

It ships in Slate, Lunar Gold, Metallic Jasper Green, and Metallic Pink Dawn, and costs $299 like its predecessor.</p><p>In terms of what <em>is</em> new, the Vivoactive 6 gets doubled music storage to 8GB, support for two new satellite systems — BeiDou and QZSS — and a gyroscope for better wrist-tracking accuracy.</p><p>The last upgrade pairs well with the new Garmin Strength Coach and workout animations, letting you follow a months-long training plan with auto-generated workouts and see form guidance for reps on the Vivoactive 6. Of course, you'll need the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-connect-plus-in-depth-hands-on-much-more-than-an-ai-unfortunately">Garmin Connect+ subscription</a> that's generating controversy for the best indoor workouts.</p><p>Interestingly, Garmin improved running software tools on the Vivoactive 6, adding support for Track and Trail Running modes, post-run training effect, PacePro, wrist-based running dynamics, running power, and race predictions.</p><p>We only wish they'd added an altimeter for proper elevation tracking for runs, something the Vivoactive 4 had but the Vivoactive 5 cut. You'll need a Garmin Forerunner for that and other insights like training load.</p>

<p>Along with strength training, Garmin says the Vivoactive 6 will have daily suggested workouts for walking, giving an example of "speed intervals" where you pick up the pace in short bursts. Garmin's suggested workouts have typically been for running and cycling; we love this addition for more casual athletes, helping people hit their daily step goals.</p><p>Garmin also added a "smart alarm" to the Vivoactive 6, a first for the Garmin brand. Like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/why-dont-more-smartwatches-use-this-smart-rings-seemingly-obvious-trick">Fitbit's smart alarm</a>, it "looks for lighter sleep stages during a pre-selected window of time to gently wake users with a light vibration," so your REM sleep isn't disrupted, but you still wake up on time.</p><p>Otherwise, you're getting a long list of popular, mainstream-focused Garmin perks: enhanced Body Battery tracking, the Sleep Coach, wheelchair mode, images in notifications (Android only), stress tracking with meditation and breathing guidance, and Garmin Pay.</p><p>Overall, this feels like a fairly iterative update for the Vivoactive 6. But we already liked recommending the Vivoactive 5 as the entry-level Garmin watch for anyone new to the platform. The Vivoactive 6 retains that mainstream appeal, and we at least appreciate that it's trying new things with the smart alarm, strength coaching, and walk suggestions.</p><p>The Garmin Vivoactive 6 is now on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/1555457/pn/010-02985-03">Garmin's site</a>, where you can order it starting April 4.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>It’s not a new concept, but it bears repeating when a pair of wireless earbuds try to make it work: can adaptive and personalized listening change how you listen to music? Creative is taking a crack at it with the Aurvana Ace Mimi.</p><p>The earbuds are successors to the previous Aurvana Ace 2, so they share a lot of the same features and functions, but in partnering with Mimi, the focus lies more squarely on custom sound profiles. That makes things interesting in getting really personal, though you have to make compromises to fully accept what these buds are.</p>
<h2 id="keeping-things-familiar-2">Keeping things familiar</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WQCUFLAASKsYK5uBwCY2HK" name="Creative-Aurvana-Ace-Mimi-wearing" alt="Profile view of Creative Aurvana Ace Mimi earbuds in left ear." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WQCUFLAASKsYK5uBwCY2HK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Creative sticks with a familiar look by making the Ace Mimi essentially carbon copies of the previous Aurvana Ace 2. The color is different, though, with a midnight shade that isn’t as flashy as the Ace 2. Otherwise, they maintain a lot of continuity, including the super lightweight build and matte finish, and similar size case.</p><p>Creative wisely includes both extra-small and extra-large ear tips (something the Aurvana Ace 2 don’t have) with the Ace Mimi, significantly improving the odds you’ll find a fit that works for you. This is especially important for the sheer comfort and stability necessary to enjoy what these buds do best.</p><p>Because they are so lightweight and unobtrusive, I sometimes didn’t realize I even had them on. Their IPX5 rating is okay for warding off sweat, but be mindful of wiping them clean each time to avoid salt slipping through crevices and hitting internal components.</p>
<h2 id="the-right-fit-and-right-sound-2">The right fit and right sound</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1015px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:106.60%;"><img id="V8wcUwv7mej6E2HpwMtZg5" name="Creative-Aurvana-Ace-Mimi-screenshots-1" alt="Screenshots showing sound personalization test in Creative app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V8wcUwv7mej6E2HpwMtZg5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1015" height="1082" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>From the outset, the Creative app offers plenty of options to customize them to your liking. The key one lies with the Mimi-powered Sound Personalization that takes you through an exercise where you hold down an onscreen button until you stop hearing a beep.</p><p>You go through this with each ear and ultimately come up with a custom-tuned sound profile based on your hearing ability. The results then let you tailor it further by choosing either the recommended profile or opting for a softer or richer sound. There’s also an option to kind of mix it up by, say, choosing “richer” yet reducing the tuning’s intensity.</p><p>If you’re unsure about the efficacy, simply tap the “Hear the difference” button to compare it with no tuning and hear it for yourself. For me, the difference was audible in just about every respect. Not only does audio come through with more verve, it also sounds more detailed at all volumes, which is good for your ear health when you keep it a moderate level.</p><p>My one gripe about it is you have to sign up for a Creative account to get the feature. It’s free, but you’re sharing data because of it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1015px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:106.60%;"><img id="a7iSeZQyHmFBnQDQ2FYjxm" name="Creative-Aurvana-Ace-Mimi-screenshots-2" alt="Screenshots showing sound personalization and EQ in Creative app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a7iSeZQyHmFBnQDQ2FYjxm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1015" height="1082" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Despite that, the custom choices don’t end there. The Equalizer section is one of the deepest you’ll ever find on any pair of earbuds. While the five-band EQ is perhaps less granular, there are 40+ presets to pick from, including several based on popular video game franchises. Create your own and save it to add to the list. The beauty of this is you can mix and match your personalized tuning with an EQ preset you like, vastly opening up the kind of sonic variety you get out of these buds.</p><p>There’s a good reason for the video game nod since the Low Latency Mode reduces lag to better sync audio and video, an important factor when gaming or watching video.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bluetooth-audio-terms-codecs-explained">Bluetooth codec</a> support is also superb, with support for SBC, AAC, LDAC, and LC3. Going with LDAC is interesting given the Aurvana Ace 2 support aptX Lossless, but that still gives you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-to-stream-hi-res-music-from-phone" target="_blank">hi-res playback</a> from devices and services supporting it anyway. With Bluetooth LE on board here as well, there’s support for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/i-tried-bluetooth-auracast-at-ifa-2024" target="_blank">Auracast</a>, a feature most Android phones already natively include (and more are getting, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-beta-3-launch">Pixel 9</a> series).</p><p>As for controls, you have the ability to change those as you see fit. By default, a double tap on the left cycles between Ambient Control and ANC (active noise cancelation) while doing it on the right plays/pauses. Triple-tap the left to wake the phone’s voice assistant or the right to skip to the next track. Long tap left to lower volume, right to raise it.</p><p>Notably missing, however, are wear sensors to automatically pause playback when taking either earbud off — a glaring omission for this price range.</p>
<h2 id="hearing-a-little-too-much-2">Hearing a little too much</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ur6bKhah45a7Zxafx49ZQY" name="Creative-Aurvana-Ace-Mimi-close-up" alt="Close-up view of Creative Aurvana Ace Mimi earbud in left ear." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ur6bKhah45a7Zxafx49ZQY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Regardless of where you choose to wear the Ace Mimi, there’s a balancing act at work here. ANC performance is largely mediocre, with a consistent inability to drown out most noises you don’t want while wearing them. You can expect them to dampen, so it’s not like these earbuds are totally inept, it’s just that you get what you can out of a $130 pair.</p><p>That’s why finding the right ear tips is so critical for better passive isolation to help the cause. The Ace Mimi work best in quieter environments where background noise isn’t very loud, even when you push the ANC’s potency to the max on the app.</p><p>Ambient works similarly in letting you adjust how much of the background you want to hear around you. Quickly switching to this mode to hear an announcement or engage in a quick verbal interaction feels pretty seamless, though again, you’ll get clearer results from more expensive earbuds.</p>
<h2 id="superb-sound-that-can-surprise-2">Superb sound that can surprise</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wHL7yZyGpDh3eVzYihXY9S" name="Creative-Aurvana-Ace-Mimi-in-case" alt="Creative Aurvana Ace Mimi earbuds sitting in charging case with lid open." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wHL7yZyGpDh3eVzYihXY9S.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Creative cites the xMEMS drivers inside as the main, well, driver of the strong sound signature in the Ace Mimi, and I’m inclined to believe the claim. The Aurvana Ace 2 have the same drivers, which are capable of pumping out a healthy dose of bass to go with balanced mids and highs.</p><p>At this price, there’s going to be an unsurprising emphasis on bass response, but it’s nicely complemented by the surprising effectiveness of the rest of the spectrum. Warm and punchy highs, ever-present mids, and thick bass make these a pair worth looking at if you’re into music genres that skew toward the latter.</p><p>Again, you discover its extent when going through the personalized sound process. If you suffer from hearing loss or are sensitive to certain frequencies, the test can amplify or mitigate those details in impressive ways. Earbuds at this price range often give you an EQ to work with but not necessarily a hearing test that goes this far in producing a lasting result.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Xm54UULvQRXbojKjsDrmHH" name="Creative-Aurvana-Ace-Mimi-hand" alt="Creative Aurvana Ace Mimi earbuds in hand." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Xm54UULvQRXbojKjsDrmHH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It extends to watching content as well. The depth of an explosion or the crispness of dialogue, for instance, are welcome strides. Spatial audio only works if you have the ability to listen to something  via Creative’s SXFI app, though that only applies to media files you have saved on the device, not when streaming.</p><p>Phone calls prove excellent in most conditions. The onboard mics won’t completely muffle louder sounds around you, but they can muffle them enough to keep a conversation going. In quiet confines, they’re as solid as it gets at this price.</p>
<h2 id="not-so-long-battery-life-2">Not so long battery life</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2xStE7i7DMmoqCic5j5XTS" name="Creative-Aurvana-Ace-Mimi-case" alt="Creative Aurvana Ace Mimi charging case sitting up." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2xStE7i7DMmoqCic5j5XTS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Creative rates battery life at up to seven hours per charge with ANC off. Leave it on, and you’re looking at five hours or less, depending on how high the volume is. Even with three additional charges in the case, these numbers aren’t all that impressive. The case supports wireless charging, so it’s easy to appreciate the convenience. I didn’t find a fast charging feature here but it doesn’t take too long to fully recharge both the case and earbuds.</p>
<h2 id="getting-more-for-less-2">Getting more for less</h2>
<p>While it’s not hard to find similar features and designs from others in the same price range, you’d be hard-pressed to find the level of sound customization available with the Creative Aurvana Ace Mimi. Indeed, on that alone, they’re competitive relative to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds" target="_blank">best wireless earbuds</a>.</p><p>They sound better than some earbuds costing significantly more, and despite their limited ANC and battery prowess, they feel like a real bang-for-your-buck option. Good sound is worth paying a value price, especially when these sound so much better than the AirPods.</p>

<ul><li>The OnePlus Open is picking up a new update with the March 2025 security patch via OxygenOS 15.</li><li>The changelog details a security improvement for user data, as well as a couple of home screen customization updates.</li><li>The OnePlus Open 2 is still of interest, especially after a teaser earlier this year, which suggests it will be pencil-thin like the OPPO Find N5.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>OnePlus is currently starting to roll out its latest OxygenOS update for its book-style foldable.</p><p>The update notice was posted on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1825708001307131911">Community forums</a>, stating its rollout bears vCPH2551_15.0.0.700(EX01) for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> users in India. Those with the device are in for quite a few improvements, beginning with the phone's privacy and security. According to OnePlus, the latest OxygenOS 15 update "Improves the process for resetting your privacy password." The patch notes add that users will be prompted to link their "privacy password with their account."</p><p>It seems this is designed to help users regain access if they've forgotten their credentials. OnePlus states users can reset their password through their account.</p><p>Elsewhere, the March 2025 security patch is rolling alongside these changes. The Chinese OEM is also improving the music player controls of Spotify's Live Alerts. OnePlus adds it's bringing a slight home screen customization change for folders and widgets. For folders, users can resize them to be 1x2 or 2x1 on the home screen.</p><p>The update for widgets is said to facilitate more "visual consistency" as foldable users now receive a 2x2 size option for third-party widgets. It says users will find this new appearance choice in <strong>Settings > Home Screen & Lock Screen > Optimize Widget appearance</strong>.</p><p>The remainder of the changelog is as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Adds an option to rename an app group by touching and holding its shortcut on the Home screen</li><li>Improves the widget design for Zomato and Blinkit in Shelf to better communicate the app status</li><li>Improves Wi-Fi network switching and mobile data roaming for a more seamless experience</li></ul>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="XfwHZfFvCTHoKYvZ8dSYcF" name="oneplus-open-23.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XfwHZfFvCTHoKYvZ8dSYcF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As previously stated, the update has been announced for India; however, it's expected to hit other regions (like the U.S.) soon. It may appear for users later this week or next week. Regardless, you can continue to manually check your device for the patch if you wish.</p><p>The OnePlus Open's latest major update arrived around the holidays last year as the company rolled out its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-is-rolling-out-to-oneplus-open-in-the-u-s-next-week">Android 15 upgrade</a>. Under the guise of OxygenOS 15, the update brought several animation tweaks to the foldable, which made things feel more consistent and smooth. Additionally, OnePlus worked on improvements for users utilizing third-party applications. As AI is all the rage, the company brought a few tools, such as AI Retouch and AI Reflection Eraser. Both were aimed at reducing the amount of blur and/or unfocused imagery in user photos.</p><p>Like today's update, the Android 15 initially started in India before hitting global regions a week later.</p><p>While you may not want to hear it, we're still waiting on the OnePlus Open 2, despite its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-really-hope-the-oneplus-open-2-doesnt-make-the-same-mistake-as-the-pixel-9-pro-fold">sheer number of delays</a>. The device is expected to be a more global-oriented device based on OPPO's Find N5, which looks incredibly pencil-thin. There's still a lot of uncertainty about when the device will be released, so it's best to play things by ear for now.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>When it rains, it pours, and we're right in the middle of a storm as there are new gaming handhelds being announced every week. One of the latest is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/abxylute/abxylute-one-pro">Abxylute One Pro</a>, which is a successor to the Abxylute Cloud Gaming Handheld from 2023.</p><p>Abxylute saw what Logitech was about to do with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/logitech-g-cloud-gaming-handheld-launch">G Cloud</a> and tried to capitalize on the idea of a "cloud-gaming-first" handheld. Unlike AYANEO or AYN, the One Pro doesn't have a flagship processor; instead, it relies on the MediaTek Genio 510.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kqOIbOK4W_c" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>This is paired with just 4GB of RAM and 64GB of expandable storage, which isn't all that much, but that's the point. However, there's one handheld out there that can do everything the One Pro promises, as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.goretroid.com/products/retroid-pocket-5-handheld">Retroid Pocket 5</a> has a few key advantages over Abxylute's newest gaming handheld.</p><p>Powered by the Snapdragon 865, the Pocket 5 is already quite a bit more performant than the One Pro. This lets you enjoy many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-games">best Android games</a> while also being pretty fantastic when it comes to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-emulators-android">retro emulation</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xdc7ksvpoxfqoDvL63HKT8" name="retroid-pocket-5-halo-2-anbernic-rg35xxsp-gamesir-super-nova-controller" alt="Playing Halo 2 on the Retroid Pocket 5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xdc7ksvpoxfqoDvL63HKT8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I was surprised to see Abxylute point out that the One Pro can emulate up to PS2, because while it's a massive improvement over its predecessor, it's also not unprecedented. Meanwhile, the Retroid Pocket 5 has a unique advantage in that you can either stick to Android, or you can install a custom Linux firmware (ROCKNIX or Batocera) that unlocks Xbox and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/whats-going-on-with-ps3-for-android-emulation">PS3 emulation</a>.</p><p>Okay, the latter was more exciting before RPCS3-Android began development, but there's no such solution with Xbox emulation. Sure, you can fire up Xbox Game Pass or any of the other cloud gaming services and stream Halo Infinite. But being able to play the original Halo and Halo 2 without worrying about internet speeds is pretty incredible.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5328px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jkKuRNaZ99AJgj4RXQ57KU" name="abxylute-one-pro-press-lifestyle-2" alt="Abxylute One Pro PS2 emulation" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jkKuRNaZ99AJgj4RXQ57KU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5328" height="2997" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Abxylute)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On top of that, another big benefit that the Retroid Pocket 5 has over the Abxylute One Pro is the AMOLED display. Abxylute opted for an LCD panel, which looks great in the videos I've seen, but it doesn't match up to an OLED screen. And the one that we have in the Pocket 5 looks simply incredible.</p><p>However, the One Pro has an advantage of its own, as it sports a 7-inch display compared to the 5.5-inch screen of the Pocket 5. This also makes for a larger footprint, which some will likely find to be more comfortable than what Retroid provides.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5328px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kpi96FzpCnL3P6WRpevDRU" name="abxylute-one-pro-press-lifestyle-1" alt="Abxylute One Pro game selection press lifestyle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kpi96FzpCnL3P6WRpevDRU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5328" height="2997" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Abxylute)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Lastly, there is one more hurdle that I think Abxylute will need to figure out how to overcome, and that's price. Right now, the One Pro can be ordered via Kickstarter for $209. But that's just the Early Bird price, and the One Pro will jump up to $249 once it's officially released.</p><p>That's still less expensive than the G Cloud and its $299 price tag, but it's also more expensive than the Retroid Pocket 5. It's even more expensive than the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/heres-why-im-getting-the-retroid-pocket-flip-2-and-the-pocket-classic">Retroid Pocket Flip 2</a>, which is essentially the Pocket 5 in a clamshell form factor, complete with the OLED display.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2042px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="bHqL3yYMLPcBP9Y4L6c2YV" name="retroid-pocket-flip-2-press-lifestyle" alt="Retroid Pocket Flip 2 in Ice Blue press lifestyle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bHqL3yYMLPcBP9Y4L6c2YV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2042" height="1149" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Retroid)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nevertheless, it's interesting to see Abxylute release a new cloud-first gaming handheld while Logitech hasn't decided to do the same with the G Cloud. If the One Pro's Kickstarter campaign is anything to go by, there's still plenty of interest in such a handheld, even with similar devices already available.</p><p>If you want to get the Abxylute One Pro, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/abxylute/abxylute-one-pro">Kickstarter campaign</a> is officially live. Early Bird pricing puts the handheld at $209, which saves you $40 off the expected retail price of $249.</p>

<ul><li>Three leaked renderings, reportedly of the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, suggest Google might not veer much off its 9 series designs.</li><li>The foldable looks largely similar to the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, with a similar rear camera housing, cover display, and internal designs.</li><li>Pixel 10 Pro Fold rumors have been scarce; however, the phone may see another August launch this year.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Starting the week is an alleged leak involving the potential design of Google's next foldable phone.</p><p>A trio of supposed renderings of the Pixel 10 Pro Fold were surfaced from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/google-pixel-10-pro-fold">Android Headlines</a>, which purport an extremely familiar phone. Funnily enough, the rumored renders even showcase the next device in the same Porcelain color as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">its predecessor</a>, so perhaps that's to be expected once again. Regarding its hardware, the alleged imagery suggests the Pixel 10 Pro Fold will continue to feature a similar cover display (in design) to the 9 Pro Fold.</p><p>The publication didn't give specifics; however, it claims the next iteration is the "spitting image" of what we received last year.</p><p>There's a centered punch-hole selfie camera on the external display, too. Internally, the renderings show a screen with seemingly thick bezels and a right-corner oriented selfie camera — like 2024. Google may continue to feature rounded corners for its next foldable phone, which has become expected. Moreover, the rear camera array may continue to host three cameras. Consumers <em>may </em>see this as a 48MP primary lens, a 10.5MP ultrawide, and a 10.8MP telephoto.</p><p>The publication claims the device could be offered at a "lower price point" compared to last year. Additionally, there's speculation that Google could trim down the phone's thickness, though it's unclear by how much. Other rumors include the Tensor G5, 16GB of RAM with 256GB or 512GB internal storage.</p>

<p>As a reminder, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">the Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> features an 8-inch Super Actua Flex display and a 6.3-inch cover display. Considering how similar these renders suggest the next version will be, there's a chance consumers may see specs like this once more. Both the cover display camera and the internal one are 10MP on last year's model. Battery-wise, the 9 Pro Fold contains a 4,650mAh setup and 45W wired charging.</p><p>Information concerning the Pixel 10 Pro Fold has been scarce, but it's been expected ever since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-supposed-codenames-leaked">the 10 series' codenames</a> were leaked last fall. In that leak, it was stated the series would see the following names: Frankel, Blazer, Mustang, and Rango. These are for the base Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, 10 Pro XL, and the 10 Pro Fold, respectively. Elsewhere, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-has-reportedly-finished-designing-the-pixel-10s-custom-tensor-g5-soc">reportedly finished designing</a> its first fully custom Tensot G5 chip — which is to be built by TSMC — earlier this year.</p><p>The chip is expected to bring improved performance over the G4, as well as better battery life for Google's next phones. What's more, it was rumored that the G5 would pack more AI (to no one's surprise) like "Speak to Tweak" and a feature similar to Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-sketch-to-image-on-a-samsung-galaxy-phone">Sketch to Image</a>.</p><p>It's still early to get too excited over what's rumored for the Pixel 10 Fold, as the device is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-google-pixel-10-has-a-model-number-according-to-gsma-database-entries">speculated to launch in August</a> once again.</p>

Even as the sale wraps up, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C4B9MWHY"><strong>Amazon has slashed 29% off the Samsung Galaxy Tab S9,</strong></a> marking a $270 discount on a top pick for Galaxy fans.</p><p>Originally unveiled in 2023, the Galaxy Tab S9 has remained a top pick due to its inclusion of the first-party Samsung S Pen stylus, a long-lasting battery, and a good-looking 11-inch AMOLED display. This particular deal is for the 256GB configuration, and the base S9 features a smaller screen than those of the S9 Plus and Ultra.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want a reasonably-priced tablet that includes a stylus; you have other Galaxy devices and like them; you're looking for a tablet with Galaxy AI features.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you want a tablet with a cheaper price point than this and would consider the S9 FE, despite an LCD screen; you prefer an even larger tablet than 11 inches; having good cameras is a major priority to you.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9">Samsung Galaxy Tab S9</a> has remained one of our top picks in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets#section-best-overall">best Android tablet overall</a> and the best entry-level flagship categories, sporting an 11-inch AMOLED screen with a 120Hz refresh rate, an in-display fingerprint sensor, an included S Pen, and more.</p><p>It also comes with some of the latest Galaxy AI features available, and the tablet's speedy performance is supported by the 8GB of RAM and a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset. It's also fairly lightweight, has an 8,400mAh battery, and is available in either Graphite or Beige.</p><p>Overall, we'd say it's a pretty great pick for casual users or really anyone who wants a stylus to come with their tablet, and especially at $270 off the normal purchase price.</p>

Most earbuds look nearly identical to one another, but nothing looks like the CMF Buds Pro 2 which are back down <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/CMF-Buds-Pro-Cancelling-Technology/dp/B0D82ZBMBT/"><strong>to just $50</strong></a> during the remaining hours of Amazon's Big Spring Sale!</p><p>Aside from sporting noise cancelling and a comfortable, light fit, CMF Buds Pro 2 feature the best charging case on any set of earbuds to date. That's because it doesn't just charge your earbuds, it also <em>controls</em> them with the handy click wheel on the case that doubles as a button.</p><p>You can use this to quickly adjust the volume from your pocket — instead of using those finicky touch controls most earbuds have — click it to play or pause, switch songs, open an app, call up your favorite AI assistant, and more thanks to its highly customizable nature. And, of course, all this cool functionality comes at a fraction of the price of most other earbuds.</p>

<p>These are true wireless earbuds, which means there's no cable between them and no cable to plug into your phone. Each earbud is packed with a 60mAh battery, so you get about 10 hours of listening before needing to dock them back into the case. And, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">unlike some earbuds</a>, docking them in the case is super easy.</p><p>Of course, a $50 pair of earbuds aren't going to produce the same level of sound that a $300 pair will, but that didn't stop Harish from being impressed. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/im-convinced-nothings-cmf-buds-pro-2-are-the-only-budget-earbuds-worth-buying">He said</a>, "these are the best-sounding budget earbuds I've ever used, and <strong>the sound quality is equivalent to products that cost thrice as much.</strong>" Considering how much of an audiophile Harish is, I took his word for it and picked up a pair for myself. I couldn't be happier!</p><p>I've been using these as my daily pair of headphones since last Fall and can't get enough of how cool this case is. There's simply nothing like being able to adjust your volume, skip songs, call up Gemini, or do nearly anything else you want with the customizable wheel button on the case.</p><p>If you're a frequent flyer, you might want to spend a little more money on a pair of earbuds with stronger ANC than these but, for most scenarios, the sound quality and ANC strength make these must-haves. Especially for $50!</p>

<hr>
<p>Starting today (Mar. 31), Oura will roll out its new AI-powered feature to users globally. The company is calling this feature the "Oura Advisor," a digital assistant designed to help users better understand their health goals. This feature was in the testing phase for most of last year when the company announced that users would be able to take it for a spin via<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-app-advisor-labs-test-launch"> Oura Labs</a>.</p><p>Now, Oura tells Android Central that all Android and iOS users will see the Oura Advisor pop-up on their apps. This will empower users to stay on track with their health goals, giving them "personalized insights, recommendations, and encouragement."</p><p>Oura added that this advisor is less of a feature and more of a coach to the smart ring wearer. It wants people to think of the Oura Advisor as their trainer that they can carry in their pockets.</p>

<p>Once this digital coach is summoned, it will tell you what your health stats look like and give you personalized recommendations on what kind of activities you should focus on. It has the power to look through various health parameters to give users "tailored" lifestyle changes so that they can improve their sleep, stay calmer in stressful situations, and optimize their overall physical and mental health.</p><p>What's more, is that the Oura Advisor will give you these recommendations in a "coherent guidance storyline" that connects different pieces of advice into a story that's easy to follow along.</p>

<p>Additionally, since the Oura Advisor is a conversational chatbot, its tone is also dynamic — this means your digital coach could take a supportive, mentoring, or even goal-oriented tone. "It adjusts based on the user's chosen tonality, affecting the conversation's perspective while maintaining empathy and core values," Oura added.</p><p>This AI chatbot can "think" independently about you even when you're inactive, so it can give you more relevant advice when you engage with it. While it's doing its thinking, the Oura Advisor will look through different user trends and data, as it has access to something called “Memories.”</p><p>Oura explains that these Memories allow it "to retain and reference context from past conversations and make long-term connections about user behaviors and patterns."</p>

<p>According to data collected during the test run of the Oura Advisor, the company reports that over 60% of users interacted with the digital coach multiple times a week, with 20% using it daily and 56% reporting that the Oura Advisor helped turn insights into actions with health benefits.</p><p>Essentially, with the integration of AI, the Oura Advisor aims to help users better understand their Oura Ring's data and trends, which will "empower them to take control of their health and well-being," the ring maker added.</p><p>Elsewhere, Oura is partnering with more retailers to make the latest Oura Ring accessible to more people. Last week, the company announced that the smart ring will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-retail-expansion-to-costco-announced" target="_blank">debut</a> on Costco's website and will be available to Costco Members in sizes four through 15 and in gold, silver, and black.</p>

<p>Plenty of Galaxy fans are still twiddling their thumbs waiting for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a> to hit their devices, but early signs hint that Samsung might speed up the release of its next big software update.</p><p>Samsung is already deep into developing Android 16 with its One UI 8 skin, as shown by recent benchmark data from the base <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a>.</p><p>Shared on X by tipster Tarun Vats, a Geekbench screenshot shows the Galaxy S25 (SM-S931B) running a One UI 8 build based on Android 16. The device packs a Snapdragon 8 Elite chip and 12GB of RAM.</p>

<p>Prior to this, internal One UI 8 test builds for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> surfaced on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/tarunvats33/status/1897973087674478795" target="_blank">Samsung’s servers</a>. This new leak further confirms that Samsung is actively working on its next software release.</p><p>Samsung’s first Android 16 test builds popping up in March is a big shift. Last year, we didn’t see <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> test builds <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-early-testing-spotted">until May</a>.</p>

<h2 id="way-ahead-of-schedule-2">Way ahead of schedule?</h2>
<p>The earlier arrival of these builds suggests One UI 8.0 is moving faster than One UI 7.0. But that’s not too surprising. Last year's 7.0 update was basically a complete makeover under the hood, so of course it needed extra time in the shop.</p><p>With all that architectural work now out of the way, Samsung is apparently able to shift gears and speed up development this time around. Unlike One UI 7, One UI 8 builds on an existing framework, allowing Samsung to focus more on optimizations and new features instead of major structural changes.</p>
<h2 id="but-hold-the-comparisons-2">But hold the comparisons</h2>
<p>However, comparing these two development cycles isn’t apples to apples. Google usually drops new Android versions alongside its fall Pixel launch, but rumors suggest Android 16 might arrive earlier this year, possibly in June instead of the usual August or September.</p><p>This isn't Google cutting the line, though. The tech giant is just <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-may-only-support-seamless-updates">shifting to a new development approach</a> that speeds up major Android updates.</p><p>With Android 16 possibly launching earlier, it makes sense that Samsung is already testing One UI 8. Since the update is expected to be more incremental, its rollout could closely follow Google’s timeline.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you're looking for a small, affordable power bank that can keep devices charged for a while; you don't want to spend more than $15 on a portable charger; you need a power bank with 30W fast-charging.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you'd rather upgrade to a larger battery and wouldn't mind paying more.</p><p>The Anker Zolo Power Bank is a pretty basic portable device charger, but at under $13, it's not a bad option even as a backup or second power bank. Anker says this device can charge most phones to roughly 50 percent in under half an hour using its 30W charging speeds. In addition to the built-in USB-C cable, it also includes a 20W recharging port for the power bank itself.</p><p>The Zolo is available in Black, Blue, Pink, or White, and it measures just about 4.32 inches by 2.58 inches for a small, transport-friendly design.</p><p>If you're looking for an even larger portable power bank, the Zolo's 20,000mAh configuration is currently about 32% off, ringing in at just under $25. Or you can upgrade even further to around 50,000mAh, which many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-battery-packs">best power banks</a> offer. Still, you'll definitely pay more at the premium level, and 10,000 or 20,000mAh is usually enough for most phones and other small devices.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you're looking for a phone with a vibrant AMOLED display; battery life is a major selling-point for you when it comes to phones; you want a phone that comes with the latest AI features, without going with the latest-gen phone.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you want an even more affordable smartphone than this; you like smaller phones; you'd rather upgrade to the S25, S25 Plus, or S25 Ultra.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-launch">Samsung launched the S24 FE</a> last September, featuring a vibrant 6.7-inch SuperAMOLED display, as well as a 4,700mAh battery, both of which were upgrades from the S23 FE. At the time, we said this phone was a little pricey for the offering, but over $100 off might be just the right price point for interested parties. However, the screen features a quick 120Hz refresh rate, while Samsung says battery life can last up to 28 hours of "watching" time, or 81 hours of listening time.</p><p>The "Fan Edition" S24 also boasts 8GB of RAM, a 50MP primary rear camera lens,  AI features such as Generative Edit, Slow-mo, Portrait Studio, Circle to Search, and more. Additionally, those with other Samsung devices will find user-friendly compatibility, with added Galaxy features such as extended displays, quick file transfers, special lossless listening codecs, and more.</p>

<p>Garmin Connect Plus is a surprisingly useful skeleton of a strong fitness subscription. The AI is mostly a retread of the Garmin analytics you know and love, with plenty of room to improve. But it's just window dressing next to the Performance Dashboard, coaching videos, and other features designed to give Garmin fans FOMO.</p><p>But the better Connect Plus gets and the more features it receives, the more it will piss off loyal Garmin customers already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/smartwatches/furious-garmin-users-revolt-over-new-subscription-service-we-need-to-take-a-firm-stand" target="_blank">revolting over the service</a>.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/new-garmin-connect-plus-subscription-adds-active-intelligence-beta-enhanced-smarts">Garmin Connect Plus</a> is arguably the most significant change Garmin has made to its business model in years. It joins the AI health and fitness trend alongside Fitbit, Samsung Health, and Strava (among others). In doing so, Garmin undermined its decade-long business model of free software paired with expensive hardware.</p><p>Rather than focus on whether or not Garmin <em>should</em> have made Connect Plus — or at least bundled it with recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Fenix 8</a> purchases or all recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watches</a> to ease the transition — I'll discuss how Connect Plus works in practice, what needs improvements, and where things should go from here.</p>

<p>Garmin Active Intelligence and Strava Athlete Intelligence invite obvious comparisons. Aside from the similar names, both analyze personalized fitness data and contextualize recent activities against past trends. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/strava-announces-stable-athlete-intelligence-anti-cheating-and-flyover-sharing">Strava's AI recently left beta</a>, while Garmin's may be in beta for some time. So let's compare them!</p><p>Garmin's AI is basically a time-sensitive chatbot that reacts to your most recent or relevant fitness data and trends. I've seen it discuss my intensity minute trends, current training status, most recent activity, elevated stress averages, and daily step trends over the past couple of days.</p><p>It ranges from insightful to nagging and sometimes repeats itself when it runs out of things to say.</p><p>Strava's AI focuses more closely on individual workouts. Each activity will compare your heart rate, HR zone breakdown, pace, elevation gain, and Relative Effort against your 30-day average. That's something I'd love to see Garmin emulate, showing a static AI breakdown in each run's "Overview" rather than a fleeting note in the Home page.</p>

<p>I will say that Garmin's AI seems a bit more polished than Strava's AI was in early beta; I still remember the latter telling me that my 140 bpm-average run was an anaerobic effort. On the other hand, Active Intelligence repeats info from the In Focus charts, watch face data fields, or Glance widgets on your watch. Basically, it's about reinforcing what Garmin considers important, not anything "original."</p><p>Maybe the AI will get more focused and specialized based on what tidbits you label as "Interesting" or "Not Interesting" in the app. At least, I hope it will!</p><p>I rarely sleep wearing my Garmin watch; people who closely follow their HRV Status or Body Battery data may benefit more from these text-based summaries. For the people who only wear Garmin watches for activities and Garmin Coach, I hope they can make Active Intelligence more focused on that side of things.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="dayKKxVDbTqXNNUmuBwPeL" name="garmin-active-intelligence-screenshots" alt="Samsung Garmin Connect Plus screenshots showing the Active Intelligence AI summarizing users' data to recommend future activities." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dayKKxVDbTqXNNUmuBwPeL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For instance, the Garmin Coach tab could show an AI summary of how you've improved since Week 1, or how well you're keeping up with your scheduled workouts. Or the Challenges view could note if you're behind on certain goals and what kind of workout you should do next to keep track.</p><p>I'd like to see Active Intelligence focus more on longer-term trends. The Performance Dashboard (see the next section) has a ton of useful insights and trends across years of data; maybe the AI can note which charts and fields you're tracking and update you on changing trends when you don't have time to log into the desktop app.</p><p>As it is, Active Intelligence is a nice, limited perk. Garmin watches were already special because people could trust the Firstbeat Analytics algorithm analyzing their data behind the scenes. This AI just puts that information into text form. So, let's talk more about the other Connect Plus features.</p>
<h2 id="performance-dashboard-is-the-best-part-of-connect-plus-2">Performance Dashboard is the best part of Connect Plus</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ozzinSD9xhwP2EnnBao3TN" name="Garmin-Performance-Dashboard-charts" alt="Nine Garmin Performance Dashboard charts showing an athlete's performance over time in terms of Distance, elevation, training status, heart rate zones, hill score, and other training details." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ozzinSD9xhwP2EnnBao3TN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I haven't spent much time in the Garmin Connect desktop app, except to export GPX files for my HR and GPS tests; the mobile version is more accessible and doesn't trigger a 2FA code, no matter how often I check "Remember Me." However, the Performance Dashboard makes the desktop Connect app so much more compelling.</p><p>This new Connect Plus feature has <strong>123</strong> charts, and you can set up a max of 18 to be visible at any given time. There are far too many categories to list here, but you can track the basics like distance, number of activities, or training load, or more specialized stats like your running form, endurance/hill scores, cycling power, swim strokes, Body Battery, or race predictor over time.</p><p>For each of your 18 charts, you can set a custom date range like "this month" or "last 26 weeks," as well as add overlay stats so you can see (for example) how your total distance over time matches with your chronic load or average daily stress.</p>

<p>Basically, it's a treasure trove of data that you can fine-tune into a much better and personalized summary of your recent progress than Garmin can fit into its mobile "In Focus" section.</p><p>My immediate favorite? The "Comparison" charts that show how my 2025 number of activities, mileage, or elevation gain compares to my stats in 2024. It helps me see (without having to write down stats myself) that I've fallen slightly behind and need to pick up the pace in April.</p><p>It's incredibly comprehensive and customizable from my perspective as a semi-serious runner. So the only real complaint I can make about Performance Dashboard is, well, that Garmin held this back for its subscription service.</p>
<h2 id="garmin-coach-s-training-guidance-has-the-most-potential-2">Garmin Coach's Training Guidance has the most potential</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="CKUpWQ3JnE9zxn6JgRF4wf" name="Garmin-run-coach-training-video" alt="A video showing the words "Garmin Run Coach" on a Google Pixel 9 held in hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CKUpWQ3JnE9zxn6JgRF4wf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you sign up for Garmin Run or Cycling Coach, you get a months-long training program with customized workouts; no subscription is needed. What's new is "additional exclusive expert guidance from Garmin coaches — including educational content and videos — for peak performance."</p><p>I haven't seen too much of this yet because you only get one video per day; I've seen a generic "Welcome to your plan" onboarding video and another describing why "base" workouts matter.</p><p>But Garmin has always talked about its Coaching algorithm being backed by real-life coaches, and I'd <em>love</em> to see daily videos tied to your current workout or general advice.</p><p>For instance, if you have an anaerobic sprint workout planned, a coach could explain why it's necessary for runners who prefer longer, slower runs; show footage of possible warm-up stretches before your sprints; or talk about different types of track workouts if you're bored with Garmin's usual options.</p><p>Specific to the new Garmin strength cross-training workouts, we could see videos related to proper squat form or how certain muscle groups translate into better running or cycling form. I doubt they'd have the production value of Apple Fitness+ workout videos, but it's a start!</p><p>I can't say whether these educational videos will live up to my hopes, but this feels like a natural way for Garmin to augment its free Coach with content that feels reasonable to pay for rather than a feature that <em>should</em> be free.</p>
<h2 id="new-badges-fun-novelty-or-pay-to-win-mistake-2">New badges: Fun novelty or pay-to-win mistake?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="jrYPAhLowN2cXAxLxUTrBg" name="Garmin-connect-plus-new-badges" alt="A series of gold Garmin Connect+ badge challenges available to Join in the Connect app on the Google Pixel 9." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jrYPAhLowN2cXAxLxUTrBg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I don't pay much attention to Garmin badges except as a motivator to try and hit certain monthly or quarterly mileage and steps goals. Others take these badges as a point of pride, competing with friends on points leaderboards.</p><p>Now, Connect Plus is adding a bunch of new, gold-tinted badges that provide more variety in what you can track. Next month, you can aim to burn 8,000 calories, climb 500/1,000 meters while running or hiking, record 3 hours in HR zone 3, hit a high Body Battery score for 7+ days, or average a fast pace or higher HR across a few hours of walking.</p><p>Garmin badges have always felt too rigid and repetitive to me, so I see this as a fun novelty, especially if Garmin offers unique challenges every month. But I can absolutely understand how the more serious Garmin power users might see this as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gadgetsandwearables.com/2025/03/28/garmin-badge-pay/">pay-to-win change that upends the entire system</a> because people who <em>don't</em> pay for Connect Plus can't keep up with those who do.</p>
<h2 id="what-comes-next-with-connect-plus-2">What comes next with Connect Plus</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2923px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="WLp83g35Kn66APtTaXDoZQ" name="Garmin-Connect-Plus-beta-hero-2" alt="A photo of the Garmin Connect app Home tab showing the new Connect+ Active Intelligence summary, which describes the quality and training effect of a recent three-mile track workout.

<p>Garmin always felt like the exception to these subscription-driven companies, selling pricey hardware that would pay itself off by lasting for years with no post-purchase fees.</p><p>Connect Plus changes that, and while long-time fans might not care about the AI, they'll certainly resent not getting the Performance Dashboard and the other perks.</p><p>Some of the Connect Plus features feel like niche, power-user upgrades. It would've been nice if the new LiveTrack upgrades — a dedicated URL, auto-text alerts, and the option to embed your progress chart on a website — had been free updates, but I doubt the majority of Garmin customers use LiveTrack (correct me if I'm wrong!).</p><p>The new Live Activity tool feels much more like a "base" feature. You can see a few real-time stats in the mobile app during an activity, as well as trigger the next step in an indoor workout while checking the proper form for about 500 different exercise types. This has a lot of widespread appeal, both for regular gym-goers and for beginners, and it's a shame to see it behind the paywall.</p><p>Overall, I think Connect Plus would've always annoyed people on principle, but less so if Garmin had had the foresight to offer a longer trial period to recent watch buyers. Google and Apple give a six-month trial with a new device, and Samsung has made <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> free for a couple of years. If Garmin had done the same, it would've lessened the sting a bit.</p><p>As it is, we're going to have to watch closely to see what Garmin does with Connect+ moving forward. In most cases, people wait eagerly for new features; in this case, any new Connect+ features through the rest of 2025 will only worsen the outrage.</p>

Especially if it's just a one-off or one with a different color compared to what was originally released.</p><p>That being said, an exception should be made for controllers and other peripherals that hit that nostalgia bone in the right way. Such is the case with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://backbone.com/products/backbone-one-usb-c-xbox-edition/">Backbone One: Xbox Edition</a>, which came as a surprise announcement on a random Thursday in March.</p><p>The Backbone One was originally launched all the way back in 2020. Then, an updated iteration landed in 2023, implementing a few improvements while also arriving after Apple made the switch from Lightning to USB-C and introducing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/backbone-playstation-edition-android-controller-launch">PlayStation Edition</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3404px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="p4rnFTg8Yi7eSR9ejDVBnQ" name="backbone-one-xbox-edition-this-is-an-xbox-render" alt="Backbone One: Xbox Edition "This is an Xbox" promo render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p4rnFTg8Yi7eSR9ejDVBnQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3404" height="1915" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Backbone)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Fast forward to 2025, and there's now an Xbox Edition, but it doesn't just slap lipstick on and call itself a by different name. Backbone worked with Microsoft to bring us a controller with the same Translucent Green color scheme as the original Halo Special Edition Xbox. And it looks simply incredible.</p><p>While the PlayStation Edition ditches the ABXY buttons to match up with the shapes on the DualSense controller, you won't find a dedicated PlayStation button. On this latest iteration, the "Capture" button has been (somewhat) surprisingly replaced by an Xbox logo. I say somewhat because I can only assume that this was probably one of Microsoft's requirements before signing off on such a collaboration.</p><p>It would've been awesome to have the original Xbox logo, but let's be honest; it's not like there's really much real estate to work with here. Plus, who cares?!? I seriously haven't been this excited about a controller since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nintendo-switch-online">Nintendo</a> started releasing modern versions of its classic controllers.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="upnuwJyGKztjivhnTmaP4Q" name="8bitdo-retro-87-keyboard-mouse-hero-render" alt="8Bitdo Retro 87 keyboard and mouse lifestyle render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/upnuwJyGKztjivhnTmaP4Q.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 8Bitdo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While my excitement levels are off the charts, Backbone isn't the only company working with Microsoft on similar collaborations. Earlier this year, 8Bitdo released the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/8Bitdo-Mechanical-Bluetooth-Backlight-Programmable/dp/B0DP9B2WYY/">Retro 87 keyboard</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Optical-Wireless-Charging-Programmable-Switches/dp/B0DMVLD2HC/">Retro R8 Mouse</a>, both of which are also equipped with the same Translucent Green shell from the original Xbox.</p><p>8Bitdo also added a bit of extra flair, as the directional keys are translucent and aim to match up with the ABXY colors from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Hyperkin-Wired-Controller-Windows-Anniversary-Limited/dp/B09FYFT4NN/">Duke</a>. Now, I want to see what other accessory makers can come up with, provided that devices or accessories are created with some guidance from Microsoft.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MfwSiWwGbiY" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>That last little bit is important, as it's not like the idea of attempting to invoke nostalgia is new. Far from it. However, most of the time, there's a difference when a company just tries to do something on its own versus when it's able to work with whatever company made the original. And I can't help but feel like that shows very well here.</p><p>Last year, Sony refreshed its lineup of devices to celebrate the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/30th-anniversary/">30th anniversary of the original PlayStation</a>. Unfortunately, I missed out on getting my hands on any of those before the scalpers got there, but I keep thinking about how it was also a missed opportunity. Imagining a Backbone One styled like the 30th anniversary DualSense would be simply incredible, and you can bet the house that I would have tried to buy one.</p><p>Just like how I immediately ordered the new Xbox Edition as soon as I saw that it was announced.</p>

But the product I used the most was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/xgimi-aura-4k-ultra-short-throw-laser-projector-review">Aura</a>; I had the ultra short throw (UST) laser projector in my bedroom, and it did a fabulous job. <br><br>That's why I was excited when XGIMI released the Aura 2; it has a much better design that's in line with the rest of the brand's devices, and it doesn't take up anywhere as much room. The best part is that it gets noticeably brighter, and with Dolby Vision integration, it has better image quality. The Aura 2 usually costs $2,699, but it's finally going on sale and can be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/XGIMI-Projector-Vision-Enhanced-Lumens/dp/B0D8KRD3JK">bought for $2,294 on Amazon</a> as of writing. That's still quite a lot of cash, but if you've been waiting to switch to a UST projector, now is the time to do so.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You need a laser projector with vibrant colors and great sound. The Aura 2 gets bright enough that there are no issues using the projector during the day, and this is an area where it has a considerable advantage over most of its rivals. <br><br><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You don't like the Android TV interface.</p>
<p>I need to start with the design, because this is an area where XGIMI made several tweaks. The Aura 2 doesn't take up anywhere as much room, and this is a big deal in a projector; I had issues slotting in a soundbar in front of its predecessor as the Aura had a massive profile, but it just isn't a problem with the Aura 2. <br><br>The design looks much better as well; XGIMI went with a fabric design interlaced with metal, and it easily looks like a high-end projector. My favorite design feature is the motorized lid; it protects the lens when the Aura 2 is not in use, and not having to clean dust from this area is a huge relief.</p>

<p>The smooth curves along with the tan color combination means the Aura 2 blends into the background much better than any other laser projector I used until now. XGIMI did all the right things in this area, and the minimal aesthetic gives the Aura a definite edge. It doesn't get as loud either, and although the design is considerably sleeker than its predecessor, it does a good job with thermal management thanks to active cooling. <br><br>The projector is packed with features; it uses XGIMI's latest autofocus and wall adjustment algorithms, and it takes less time to adjust keystone settings than its predecessor. Another cool addition is the ability to adjust the image quality based on the color of the wall; this makes a considerable difference in daily use. The Aura 2 nails the connectivity; it has Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.2, two HDMI ports at the back and one HDMI eARC, three USB-A ports, 3.5mm out as well as optical, and Ethernet.</p>

<p>The biggest differentiator with the Aura 2 is the projection; it uses a dual laser light source and goes up to 2300 lumens, delivering a significantly brighter image than its predecessor. Basically, it gets so bright that there aren't any issues using it even with ambient light — I had no problems with the projector in daylight use. <br><br>Having used the Aura for two years, I can confidently say that the picture quality of the Aura 2 is much better. It has excellent color vibrancy and contrast, and there's no graininess to the image whatsoever even at a 100-inch projection. It goes up to 150 inches, and the image quality is one of the best of any UST projector I used until now.</p>

<p>It even has Dolby Vision, and HDR content looks outstanding on the projector. There's a built-in game mode as well that lowers the latency to 20ms, but switching to this mode disables keystone correction, so you will need to adjust the positioning manually. <br><br>There's great built-in sound as well thanks to a quartet of 15W drivers, but I'd recommend getting a soundbar to use with the Aura 2 to make the most of the projector. XGIMI bundles a metal remote with the projector, and it has a good in-hand feel and access to all the settings.</p>

<p>XGIMI didn't go with Google TV, instead using Android TV 11.0. The interface is decent enough and fluid most of the time, and you get unique extras; XGIMI Wall is a recent addition that allows you to cycle through dynamic backgrounds, and it is fun to use. As with every other projector, I switched over to the Shield TV Pro as it's faster and has a better feature-set, and it unlocks the potential of the Aura 2. <br><br>Overall, XGIMI did a magnificent job with the Aura 2; the projector has a much better design, and it isn't any hassle to set up and use. The picture quality is the main reason to pick up this projector, with XGIMI delivering one of the best laser light sources in this category. It gets bright, has excellent colors, and does a fantastic job with HDR content in general. Basically, the Aura 2 has everything I need in a UST projector, and if you're looking to upgrade, this is the one to get.</p><p>XGIMI doesn't usually put its UST projectors on sale, so the fact that you're getting a decent 15% discount is a big deal. Coming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/XGIMI-Projector-Vision-Enhanced-Lumens/dp/B0D8KRD3JK">in at $2,294</a>, the projector is that much more affordable, and while that's still quite costly, you are getting what is arguably one of the best 4K UST projectors around.</p>

It's the result of the company's relentless pursuit to bring high-end experiences to lower price points and markets, and it seems to hit the mark.</p><p>The phone uses a newer MediaTek chip primed for AI performance, which is smart because the Camon 40 Premier comes with a host of AI features to take advantage of. Beyond the software, the phone has a very capable camera system that incorporates the company's latest imaging advancements, and the battery life and charging specs far surpass those of many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones" target="_blank">flagship phones</a> in North America.</p><p>The TECNO Camon 40 Premier 5G feels like a full package despite some shortcomings and questionable (yet understandable) decisions.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4056px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="WBtfgYjrm83WrmUPyNNu7K" name="TECNO-Camon-40-Premier-5G-review-10" alt="TECNO Camon 40 Premier on a gray surface" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WBtfgYjrm83WrmUPyNNu7K.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4056" height="2282" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The TECNO Camon 40 Premier was announced alongside the rest of the Camon 40 series during MWC 2025 on March 4, 2025.</p><p>The phone features a single configuration with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. It also comes in black and green colorways.</p><p>As for pricing and availability, TECNO hasn't revealed too much at the moment, but the phone is not sold in North America. However, it will be available in other regions, including Africa, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, Latin America, and Europe.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-camon-30-premier-5g-review">Camon 30 Premier</a> started at a price of around <strong>₹29,499</strong>, which is just under $350, so it stands to reason the Camon 40 Premier could cost somewhere in the same ballpark and maybe a bit more.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-tecno-camon-40-premier-what-i-like"><span>TECNO Camon 40 Premier: What I like</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4608px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uwBRGmuCXas5PuhRrD5yVJ" name="TECNO-Camon-40-Premier-5G-review-05" alt="TECNO Camon 40 Premier camera housing and One-Tap Button" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uwBRGmuCXas5PuhRrD5yVJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4608" height="2592" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For a phone that costs less than $600, the TECNO Camon 40 Premier has a lot going for it. It sits in a weird but compelling space of phones that come with flagship features and performance but sub-flagship prices. This is a space occupied by phones like the Pixel 9 and OnePlus 13R, and the Camon 40 Premier emulates this fairly well.</p><p>The hardware is a big part of what makes this a great phone. The display is a 6.67-inch AMOLED that looks great, although it doesn't blow me away. It's plenty bright, the color profile is nicely tuned so that it's not oversaturated, and the 144Hz refresh rate makes scrolling and animations smooth as butter.</p><p>Part of this has to do with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mediatek.com/products/smartphones/mediatek-dimensity-8350">MediaTek Dimensity 8530</a> chip powering the phone. While it's an upper-midrange chipset, I have no complaints about performance. Nearly everything you do on this phone is executed quickly and effortlessly, which should come as no surprise for a chip that falls just under the flagship 9000-series chips.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3882px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="yzNJc5thtD89xqb3G7Wq2P" name="TECNO-Camon-40-Premier-5G-review-13" alt="The TECNO Camon 40 Premier 5G display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yzNJc5thtD89xqb3G7Wq2P.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3882" height="2184" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This extends to gaming as well. One of my favorite games to play Honkai: Star Rail, which can be pretty taxing on a phone when played at the higher settings. Usually a phone will default to the settings it thinks it can handle, and the Camon 40 Premier was already set to "High" when I started up the game.</p><p>I decided that wasn't enough, so I turned things up to the highest graphics settings and at 60fps instead of the default 30fps. Surprisingly (or not), the phone is able to keep up just fine, and I did not notice much in the way of stuttering or massive frame rate drops.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4608px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6xikyfJGtD7w6HA97xAwRS" name="TECNO-Camon-40-Premier-5G-review-01" alt="Honkai: Star Rail on the TECNO Camon 40 Premier" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6xikyfJGtD7w6HA97xAwRS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4608" height="2592" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The software experience overall is pretty solid, even if HiOS isn't my favorite Android skin. It runs Android 15 out of the box, and you'll get some of the more common Android flourishes that we see in phones these days, such as the separated notification shade and quick panel.</p><p>The smart panel is great for multitasking, while the Dynamic Port gives you a Dynamic Island-like (albeit fairly limited) experience.</p><p>However, I can't really talk about a new phone in 2025 without mentioning AI, especially as it's a big focus for this phone. TECNO recently announced its grand plans for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/tecno-ai-foldable-strategy-interview">TECNO AI</a>, its suite of features that it's bringing to its smartphone portfolio to help bridge the gap between the $1000 phones of the world and the more affordable and accessible phones. What's great is that TECNO makes its AI very present for people who want to use it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4431px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="Rd2uZYjuXfR8pz3c2xyuKS" name="TECNO-Camon-40-Premier-5G-review-02" alt="TECNO Camon 40 Premier Dynamic Port" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Rd2uZYjuXfR8pz3c2xyuKS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4431" height="2492" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When you first turn on the Camon 40 Premier, you're taken through the setup process via TECNO's AI assistant, Ella. It's an early introduction to the phone's relationship with AI and gets you prepared for what's to come.</p><p>Once set up, swiping to the left of the home screen will unveil an AI hub of sorts called Zero Screen, where you can access a suite of TECNO AI features. Up top is Ella Briefing. Not to be confused with Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-set-up-and-use-now-brief-on-the-galaxy-s25">Now Brief</a> (although at least part of the idea is similar), it's a helpful "brief" up top to summarize and remind you of calendar events, notifications, and more.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>TECNO fit a ton of AI tools into the Camon 40 Premier, which are pretty useful.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>There's also quite an abundance of AI tools you have access to, and while you'll easily find a lot of them throughout the UI, like AI Studio in the Gallery app, the Zero Screen puts them all pretty much at your fingertips and makes it easy for you to find use cases for them.</p><p>This includes creating AI-generated art using texts or drawings, translating from images or while in a conversation, summarizing documents or creating them from photos, and more.</p><p>For the most part, these features are pretty well-baked, and TECNO's AI feels like a pretty mature offering. Accessing the settings for TECNO AI feels very comparable to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> on a Samsung phone, and many features are quite similar.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3935px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="firphMwzFrWmWenkAkZj2J" name="TECNO-Camon-40-Premier-5G-review-08" alt="TECNO Camon 40 Premier AI toolkit" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/firphMwzFrWmWenkAkZj2J.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3935" height="2213" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Going back to the idea of easy access, TECNO has implemented an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-made-the-right-decision-to-ditch-the-mute-switch-on-the-iphone-15-pro">Action Button</a> of sorts called the One-Tap Button. Interestingly, tapping it once doesn't actually do anything, but you can customize the double-tap to open any app or perform certain functions like muting the ringer.</p><p>A long press of the button will evoke the Ella assistant, which is a nice alternative to using the power button, something that other Android OEMs (looking at you, Samsung) have defaulted to. I love the added functionality of the button, and I hope to see something more like this on other Android phones.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4608px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="dS9KVR6dFRLYztuYEkZt6S" name="TECNO-Camon-40-Premier-5G-review-06" alt="TECNO Camon 40 Premier One-Tap Button" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dS9KVR6dFRLYztuYEkZt6S.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4608" height="2592" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>AI also makes its way into the camera, and the 50MP triple camera system is surprisingly good. TECNO has tuned the camera so that it can take better images in low-light conditions and also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-advanced-skin-tone-phantom-ultimate-2-mwc-2025-teaser">better reproduce more skin tones</a>. In my experience, I've been able to take plenty of respectable photos. It's not the best, but it's quite good for this price range, and I doubt anyone would be disappointed in the camera.</p><p>I love that the Camon 40 Premier has a telephoto camera with 3x optical zoom, something I feel is still pretty uncommon at this price point. It does well during the day, with photos taken at 6x coming out pretty crisp, although the sensor struggles a bit at night.</p><p>You can also take images at a moment's notice with FlashSnap, which can capture photos with a very high shutter speed while keeping the image crisp with reduced noise. So not only can it keep you from missing a moment, but it can also capture moments automatically based on the scene, which is pretty useful.</p>

<p>Finally, you'll be happy to know that battery life is superb. The 5,100mAh battery keeps the phone going all day, and I've been able to average about 7 hours or more of screen-on time. The 70W charging can also top up the phone in no time at all, with the phone going from 1-100% in just over 30 minutes. Take that, Samsung!</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3621px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="7oSShgqndra2MwaTPriVCJ" name="TECNO-Camon-40-Premier-5G-review-09" alt="Ella Briefing on the TECNO Camon 40 Premier" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7oSShgqndra2MwaTPriVCJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3621" height="2037" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The TECNO Camon 40 Premier is a pretty solid phone, thanks to its IP68 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">IP69</a> water and dust resistance ratings. Unfortunately, it doesn't feel as solid as it is. The back panel, which has a fairly uninspired design despite the brightly colored green, feels pretty cheap in hand. I often just stick to the included case, which is much grippier and still features the same color.</p><p>I also found myself a bit put off by the amount of bloatware on the phone after setting it up. You'll likely spend quite a bit of time uninstalling various apps you may or may not have heard of or just don't want on your phone.</p><p>And speaking of things you may not want on your phone, TECNO's AI is mostly pretty well-rounded, but Ella feels like a lesser version of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a>. Don't get me wrong, I think it's commendable that Ella even exists, as one of the biggest benefits of using Ella over other assistants is that it uses more local languages for better accessibility among developing and developed regions.</p><p>That said, despite Ella being integrated with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>, it just feels slower and doesn't display information in the same coherent way I would get with Gemini. For example, I asked Ella and Gemini about measles symptoms and if I should be concerned about contracting it due to the recent outbreak. Ella slowly spat out the information at me while Gemini relayed the information in a very clean manner, even creating clear lists within the app.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4296px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="eYhnZXaCHTuWaf2FvfLx2K" name="TECNO-Camon-40-Premier-5G-review-03" alt="Ella on the TECNO Camon 40 Premier" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eYhnZXaCHTuWaf2FvfLx2K.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4296" height="2417" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Also, TECNO has decided to integrate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-you-need-to-know-about-deepseek">DeepSeek R1</a> into Ella, which is a curious decision. As a Chinese-based company, it makes sense to use the newest AI model, especially after it recently went pretty viral. However, given the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/data-protection-day-is-a-great-day-to-stop-using-deepseek">privacy concerns</a>, anyone outside of China may want to refrain from using it.</p><p>Fortunately, TECNO lets you choose when to use DeepSeek R1. When opening Ella, there's a very prominent DeepSeek R1 button that you can press to toggle the model on or off. It's nice that the option is there, even if I don't plan to use it.</p><p>Even better, you still have the option to use Gemini instead of Ella if you prefer. Unfortunately, that doesn't apply to the Ella One-Tap Button shortcut, but you can still set Gemini as the double-tap option to open the app (although it doesn't automatically enable voice input).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4596px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="GoSe6wutpA3CwVKeVgbo8K" name="TECNO-Camon-40-Premier-5G-review-07" alt="TECNO Camon 40 Premier with the 70W charger" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GoSe6wutpA3CwVKeVgbo8K.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4596" height="2585" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A more minor issue I have with the TECNO Camon 40 Premier is the lack of wireless charging. It's not a particularly big deal, as wireless charging is still not commonly found on midrange phones. Plus, the 70W charging more than makes up for its absence, but it is always nice to have the option.</p><p>Lastly, the in-display fingerprint sensor works quickly, but like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-stylus-5g-2024-review">Moto G Stylus 5G 2024</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-200-pro-review">Honor 200 Pro</a> it's just way too low on the display, making it a bit awkward to use unless you're holding the phone in a specific way. Not a deal breaker, but definitely an annoyance.</p>

<p>For a phone at this price point, there are a number of similarly-priced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">cheap Android phones</a>. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-hands-on">Pixel 9a</a> is still very much new and only $499 despite its flagship-level Tensor G4 chipset. It is capable of many of the same AI features as the flagship Pixel 9 series, just at a fraction of the cost. That said, its hardware specs aren't nearly as robust, with slower charging, less RAM, and a lower refresh rate display. Plus, as of writing, the phone isn't on store shelves yet after it was delayed.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-power-2025-review">Moto G Power 2025</a> is another contender in a similar price bracket as the Camon 40 Premier. It offers great value for the price and is a beautifully designed phone that features a vegan leather finish, great battery life, wireless charging, and an IP68/69 rating for protection. However, it has a less impressive MediaTek chip and is lacking int he AI department, making this a much less exciting phone than the Camon.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You're looking for an affordable phone.</li><li>You want a phone with fast charging.</li><li>You want a good camera that can quickly capture moments.</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You live in North America.</li><li>You need wireless charging.</li><li>You don't want to deal with bloatware.</li></ul>
<p>The Camon 40 Premier 5G is feels like it's TECNO's version of a Pixel. It's a fantastic midrange phone that has all the makings of a good flagship. The MediaTek chip is more than enough for what the phone is trying to accomplish, and the AI suite feels very comprehensive, even if some of its implementation could be improved.</p><p>Despite the lack of wireless charging and questionable choices with fingerprint sensor placement and selection of AI models, battery life and great camera quality make up for any shortcomings the phone may have, of which there are few. And while it's not sold in North America, the TECNO Camon 40 Premier 5G is a phone you should consider buying if it's in your market.</p>

As just one example, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CCBTM9YK" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon has chopped $180 off the price of the Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE Plus</strong></a>, marking 17% off on a balanced, Fan Edition tablet. The S9 FE Plus comes with a 12.4-inch display and the useful Samsung S Pen. It also features an 8MP camera, and while this version only includes 128GB of storage, the microSD slot lets you increase that to as much as 1TB.</p>

<p>The whole Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 series offers some of the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">best Android tablets</a> in each pricing category, though the S9 FE Plus packs a serious performance punch. With $180 off the price from Amazon during the Big Spring Sale, you can get the premium tablet in a price range closer to the Galaxy line's mid-range offerings, giving you additional performance power without breaking the bank too much.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CCBTM9YK" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="a040557d-29bc-4533-8fb1-e09b21c0e491" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$599.99" data-dimension48="$599.99">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>✅<strong>Recommended if: </strong>you want a tablet that comes with a stylus, or in this case, the Samsung S Pen; you&apos;re looking for a tablet with a large, high-quality display; you&apos;re looking for something that can offer over 15 hours of battery life.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you&apos;d rather go with a more affordable tablet; you need a tablet with more than 128GB of storage.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE Plus offers a huge display and a premium experience, even compared to the S9 lineup. Buyers love that it comes with the Samsung S Pen, and its AMOLED screen with a 120Hz refresh rate doesn&apos;t hurt either. As for performance, the S9 FE Plus is a fairly worthy upgrade for those wanting the best of the Galaxy line, featuring a speedy Exynos 1380 Processor and 8GB of RAM. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/galaxy-tab-s9-fe-s9-fe-plus-one-ui-6-rollout">S9 FE and S9 FE Plus got their first major Android 14 update</a> in December, so this should also help quite a bit with performance and overall experience.</p><p>This configuration of the S9 FE Plus only has 128GB of storage, which may be a little low for some. However, those who don&apos;t mind using a microSD card can upgrade this to 1TB.</p>

For a limited time, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DP3GFL6D">get 16% off the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus for Amazon,</a> just weeks after the S25 series hit store shelves in February.</p><p>While the S25 Plus didn't come with any mind-blowing upgrades from the previous generation, it still offers an excellent phone experience with a powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite processor and a beautiful 6.7-inch AMOLED display. This deal is for the 512GB storage configuration, though you can also find this phone with just 256GB of storage if need be. While the 4,900mAh battery isn't the biggest on the market, you can still pretty easily make it beyond a full day, even when using the screen for several hours.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you're looking for a powerful phone with smooth, cohesive performance; you want the newest in smartphone AI features, but on a Samsung phone; you have other devices within the Galaxy ecosystem.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you prefer a larger or smaller screen and would rather go with the base S25 or S25 Ultra, respectively; you need a phone with industry-leading charging speeds.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus </a>was released in January as part of the manufacturer's Galaxy Unpacked, alongside many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">best Samsung phones </a>from the company's newest-generation lineup. The Plus comes with a 6.7-inch AMOLED display with a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate, 12GB of RAM, and a powerful Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite processing chip, together which offers a smooth, satisfying and cohesive performance.</p><p>The S25 Plus comes with the latest AI features within the Galaxy ecosystem, along with One UI, which many users love. While it will feel pretty familiar to those with the S24 Plus, it still may be worth upgrading if you want updated AI offerings and a slightly thinner overall design.</p><p>The Plus primarily varies from the rest of the S25 series in its build size and battery, boasting much of the same hardware as the smaller, entry-level S25 and the larger S25 Ultra. You can get a compact 6.2-inch screen on the base S25 and a 6.9-inch screen on the S25 Ultra. These also include slightly smaller and larger battery sizes, respectively, though we didn't have any issues with any of them lasting under a day. Luckily for those who'd rather go in these directions, these phones also have their own discounts for Amazon's Big Spring Sale.</p>

I knew I was paying for all this... stuff, but once I saw it all at the same time, I realized how much it costs and started thinking about all the other things I could do with that money, like pay bills or buy gas.</p><p>I saw subscriptions for services from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-share-amazon-prime-friends-and-family">Amazon</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-apple-tv-app-is-finally-available-on-android-with-apple-tv-plus">Apple</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/why-new-office-app-android-perfect-me">Microsoft</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-upgrade-or-downgrade-your-netflix-account">Netflix</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/hbo-max-and-discovery-plus-to-merge-by-summer-2023">HBO</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nintendo-switch-online">Nintendo</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/do-i-need-playstation-plus-play-online-multiplayer">Sony</a>, a handful of websites, and more. It made me start looking at what I <em>really</em> used versus what I'm paying for without realizing it.</p>

<p>You might be in the same boat as me. It happens easy enough; you decide you can afford to pay $10 a month for something without straining your budget but all those things add up. I'm shelling out a car payment's worth of cash every month for things I shouldn't.</p><p>It's also not going to stop because companies know they can sucker us into paying them hundreds of times instead of just once. They claim it makes things convenient and easy, but that is often a lie. So is the nonsense about having limitless content to enjoy.</p><p>For the amount of money I pay Tidal or Sony every month to get a catalog filled with things I'm not interested in, I could have bought what I wanted and still saved money. I'd also own it, sort of: you never really own music of movies or software, thanks to licensing and other bull.</p>
<p>I know I sound like some angry old man telling all the youths to get off my grass. While that may be true (Mrs. Hildenbrand says it's totally true), it doesn't change anything. Companies want us to give them money for things, then try to find ways to charge us even more money to use those things. We see new subscription services pop up every month; <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/new-garmin-connect-plus-subscription-adds-active-intelligence-beta-enhanced-smarts">even Garmin wants in on the dirty action</a> now.</p><p>It shows you how little you matter to them; you're naught but a dairy cow to be milked until you're dry, then off to the glue factory. I never thought Google, for example, loved me as a person, but the way the company tries to nickel and dime me every month is sickening. It should be illegal somehow.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MLvjukPC2P7tp9tzUzyg43" name="Google-One-hero-wide.jpg" alt="Google One on an Android phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MLvjukPC2P7tp9tzUzyg43.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I'm putting a stop to it. I've made a list of who is reaching into my pockets every month and cutting off all the hands doing it. Prime is paid for until July; then it's done. Media streamers like Netflix and Tidal are gone. I don't even remember why I started paying for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apple-tv-android-tv-in-app-purchases">Apple TV</a>, but old man Cook can find someone else to rob.</p><p>The list goes on and on, and unless I have a use for it, I'm nixing it. It's bad enough paying for utilities and insurance, let alone paying for access to the hottest new jazz quartet's debut album that I'll never listen to.</p><p>That doesn't mean it's all bad; I get useful services from some subscriptions. For example, I could set up a firewall and a dedicated storage server, connect it to the internet, and build my own universal storage system. I tried that and hated it, so I just pay Google for it.</p><p>Likewise, I prefer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-premium-family-plan-price-increase">skipping ads on YouTube</a> because I hate ads even more than I hate spending money. However, if creators keep putting sponsor segments into every video, my viewing habits are going to change, and I won't <em>need</em> to skip ads because I'll stop opening the app altogether.</p>

<p>The only thing this is going to change is what I have access to. No company cares about one person becoming sick of their shit and canceling everything. No company cares if I won't buy their product because they want me to pay extra every month to fully use it. But they would if enough of us did it.</p><p>I'm not going to start some "power to the people" manifesto or anything here. I am going to suggest you look into what you spend every month to rent things you could be buying, decide which ones you really use, and tell everyone else to hit the road.</p><p>If enough of us do it, things might even change.</p>

For instance, I recently wrote that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/nothing-essential-space-ai-hub-what-pixel-screenshots-should-have-been">Nothing's Essential Space</a> on the Nothing Phone 3a and 3a Pro is my favorite AI feature yet. That's still true, but it comes with a crucial caveat — it's currently a <em>free</em> AI premium. If or when Nothing decides to charge a monthly subscription for Essential Space, the entire value proposition changes.</p><p>This isn't just a hypothetical, because a report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/nothing-essential-space-subscription-3538293/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> recently uncovered Nothing OS code strings that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/the-nothing-phone-3a-series-might-eventually-put-a-price-on-its-new-ai-perks">reveal Essential Space could cost $120 per year</a> at some point in the future. In a statement, Nothing said the following about the rumored pricing for Essential space: "No decisions have been made yet around potential pricing and our focus remains on improving the product."</p><p>While the company didn't confirm or deny the price listed in the code strings below, the signs point to Nothing going the subscription route. Will it work?</p>
<pre class="line-numbers language-" language="" ><code><code>&lt;string name="settings_ai_claim_hint"&gt;AI credits are used to analyse an item recorded and saved in Essential Space.&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;string name="settings_ai_hint"&gt;Your free trial will expire on %s.&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;string name="free_trial_message"&gt;Ready to explore Essential Space? Tap 'Continue' to unlock all features and get early access to what's coming next, like Smart Collections, Focused Search, Flip to Record, and Camera Capture.&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;string name="free_trial_start_one_year"&gt;Start 1 year free trial&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;string name="free_trial_title"&gt;Join our early access program&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;string name="early_access_hint"&gt;Join early access to experience the full potential of Essential Space and help shape our Al-powered features.&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;string name="account_already_claimed"&gt;the fact that this account has already joined Early Access through another Nothing phone&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;string name="ai_credits"&gt;Limited Access&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;string name="ai_credits_insufficient"&gt;You reached your monthly processing limit&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;string name="ai_credits_usage"&gt;Early Access Status&lt;/string&gt;</code>
<code>&lt;string name="claim_free_trial"&gt;Continue&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;string name="claim_now"&gt;Enroll&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;string name="claim_price"&gt;(USD 120)&lt;/string&gt;</code></code></pre>
<p>If I had to guess, I would say probably not. Building up a user base of people who want to use AI features regularly is hard enough. A perfect example of this is Apple Intelligence, which hasn't seemed to captivate audiences the way the iPhone maker expected. To that end, Apple is sending out regular emails to anyone with an Apple Account promoting Apple Intelligence, seemingly in an effort to encourage more people to use it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2858px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.14%;"><img id="JXZj3qpLmsJTiFfpAvtsRS" name="Apple-Intelligence-Email" alt="Apple is trying to entice users to try Apple Intelligence with promotional emails." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JXZj3qpLmsJTiFfpAvtsRS.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2858" height="1576" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Apple is trying to entice users to try Apple Intelligence with promotional emails. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Getting enough people to regularly use and enjoy AI features is a tricky endeavor. Taking that a step further, finding enough smartphone users willing to pay for those AI features is just that much more difficult. People are very hesitant to pay for software, especially at a time when almost everything is trying out a subscription model.</p><p>While I loved using Essential Space as a way to organize my screenshots, notes, and voice recordings, I loved it as a free service. As a paid one, it's almost certainly a non-starter. I can't see myself paying for Essential Space, or Galaxy AI and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-needs-google-now-more-than-ever">Apple Intelligence</a> for that matter.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="suCPZZvt3a2pGpTMSwN2VK" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review-6" alt="Android eating Baklava generated on Galaxy S25 Ultra using Galaxy AI" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/suCPZZvt3a2pGpTMSwN2VK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For a mobile AI subscription to work, it has to successfully offer AI that's useful on your smartphone and features that extend beyond the smartphone. That's where all these mobile AI suites fall short. Essential Space and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> provide great mobile AI tools, but that's all they offer.</p><p>Meanwhile, Apple has the capability to offer a more well-rounded subscription — with perks like streaming services or cloud storage included — but can't seem to figure out the mobile AI part of it.</p>
<h2 id="why-google-one-ai-premium-is-different-2">Why Google One AI Premium is different</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Msynp8USt4qpuR962SgJfF" name="lenovo-chromebook-duet-11-review-14.jpg" alt="Google Gemini app on Lenovo Chromebook Duet 11" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Msynp8USt4qpuR962SgJfF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To me, there's only one company that can offer an AI subscription service, and that's Google. To be clear, the Google One AI Premium subscription isn't exactly cheap, costing $20 per month. It just happens to provide the perfect balance of mobile AI features, desktop AI features, and other perks.</p><p>Google One AI Premium unlocks Gemini Advanced, which will soon give users access to Gemini Live with live video streaming and screen sharing. The feature is rolling out now, and it'll enable users of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Google Pixel 9</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Samsung Galaxy S25</a> to have a natural conversation with Gemini about what's on their screen or in their surroundings.</p><p>On top of that, you get access to the Gemini chatbot powered by the latest Gemini models. That's important for AI fans because the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-2-5-pro-is-googles-latest-ai-model-with-thinking-and-multimodality-built-in">newest Gemini 2.5 model</a> is arguably the best we've ever seen. It crushes competitors like OpenAI, DeepSeek, and other top models in benchmarks. Plus, it supports document uploads and more with a two-million-token context window. Integration with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/everything-you-need-know-about-google-workspace-spaces-and-smart-canvas">Google Workspace</a> is a perk no other company can offer, too.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="EWLShJgsJzLc7eMRMsUDh" name="Gemini-Live-S25" alt="Gemini Live on the Samsung Galaxy S25." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EWLShJgsJzLc7eMRMsUDh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The reason Google One AI Premium is so useful is that it extends to just about any device you're using. You can use advanced features on your Android smartphone, or a tablet, or a desktop computer. Eventually, that'll <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-auto/gemini-could-soon-replace-google-assistant-in-android-auto-14-0">include your car with Android Auto</a> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv-survey-previews-how-gemini-live-is-coming-to-the-big-screens">and your TV with Google TV</a>. It might just <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/the-switch-from-google-assistant-to-gemini-might-kill-nest-speakers-and-displays">extend to your smart home devices</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-past-gen-pixel-buds-detailed">earbuds one day</a>, too.</p><p>Paying for a subscription to use AI features on your phone just doesn't make sense. However, an AI subscription that can work on all your devices might be a different story. It's a much better value, and Google One AI Premium includes more than just AI. It also offers cloud storage and plenty of other features.</p><p>Until Apple, Google, or Nothing can replicate that kind of experience, those brands should hold off on paywalling AI features.</p>

<ul><li>Google really wants more people to use Palm Timer, as evidenced by two new references to the feature this month.</li><li>There's a new community post that reminds Pixel owners that Palm Timer can be used on both the front and rear cameras.</li><li>This comes shortly after Pixel Camera 9.8 rolled out with tweaked wording for the Palm Timer setting.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>This month, Google has taken multiple steps to let Pixel phone owners know that the Palm Timer in the Camera app works with both the front and rear cameras. First, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/pixel-camera-9-8-rolls-out-alongside-the-march-feature-drop-with-new-tweaks">updated the Pixel Camera app with version 9.8</a> to include that distinction in the settings menu. Google also created a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/333404495/take-hands-free-photos-with-pixel’s-palm-timer?hl=en&sjid=8147400953716585836-NA" target="_blank">community post</a> this week to explain the feature and reinforce the point that it works with multiple cameras.</p><p>For those unfamiliar, Palm Timer is a Pixel-exclusive feature that can automatically start a photo timer when you show your palm to the camera. It was originally introduced with the front-facing camera and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a> in mind, but now works with the Pixel 6 and newer, and with both cameras.</p><p>It's easy to see that Palm Timer works with the front-facing camera, since users get visual confirmation in the viewfinder. Even though there's no visual cue that a Palm Timer photo was taken using the rear cameras on a non-foldable, Google wants to point out that it does indeed work.</p>

<p>"Say goodbye to awkward selfie sticks and the stress of racing to beat the timer. With Google Pixel's Palm timer, you can easily capture everyone in your selfies or your group from a distance," the community post explains. "Not only does it work with the front camera, but you can also use it with the rear camera. When you’re ready, simply raise your palm to start the countdown. Easy peasy!"</p><p>Google says that to start a Palm Timer, simply hold up your hand toward the camera. A waving motion will do the trick, and when you're ready, lower your hand to start a timer. This is a way to initiate a photo on your Pixel phone without physically pressing the shutter button, so it's great for when your Pixel is set on a flat surface or tripod far away.</p><p>Palm Timer is enabled by default, but it can be disabled by opening the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-camera-renamed-pixel-camera">Pixel Camera</a> app. From there, navigate to <strong>Settings</strong> > <strong>More settings</strong> > <strong>Palm timer</strong>. There, you can turn it off if you'd like.</p>

<ul><li>Google Meet is changing the default layout options for large meetings to get more people involved.</li><li>Dynamic layouts now automatically crop tiles to get rid of background space and fit more tiles.</li><li>You can now pin up to six tiles on your Google Meet layout, up from three previously.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is rolling out a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-meet-fresh-ui-makeover-update">major Google Meet update</a> this month that adds new layout options for large meetings, it announced today in a Google Workspace <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/03/dynamic-layouts-for-google-meet.html" target="_blank">blog post</a>. The update adds a feature called "Dynamic layouts," which uses AI to identify faces and eliminate unwanted backgrounds using two new tile types: portrait tiles and dynamic tiles.</p><p>Anyone can use portrait tiles, which Google says will "prioritize faces by cropping out excess background video." This means you can fit more faces on a single layout. Portrait tiles also feature "optimized tile placement logic to enable much more efficient layouts that minimize unused space." In other words, Dynamic layouts use smart portrait tiles to get more people involved.</p><p>Google is also adding a tile type exclusive to Google Meet conference room hardware with Dynamic layouts. They're called dynamic tiles, which splits up video for people calling in from the same conference room into individual tiles.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4lXwF95jY2I" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>"An individual video tile is created for up to 3 meeting participants joining from the same conference room with Google Meet hardware," the company explains. "AI-enabled active-speaker detection automatically highlights only the tile of the in-room speaker without any special hardware requirements."</p><p>Aside from the fact that dynamic tiles are split up using AI, they'll work just like any regular tile or portrait tile. That means you can pin a specific speaker to your layout individually, even if they are in the same room as other speakers. Previously, users would have to pin the entire conference room feed to their layout, and wouldn't be able to see individual speakers up close. This works for up to three people in the same conference room.</p><p>There are also new visual and user-interface changes. When a speaker's camera is off, their placeholder tile is now color-themed. Additionally, thanks to Dynamic layouts, Meet users can now pin up to six tiles to their layout — up from only three previously.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1484px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:62.40%;"><img id="HKspyi3NoxrdynNVfVpybh" name="Google-Meet-Dynamic-Layouts" alt="A demo of Dynamic layouts in Google Meet." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HKspyi3NoxrdynNVfVpybh.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1484" height="926" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Dynamic layouts will become the default when they arrive for all Google Meet users. However, it's possible to manually switch back to legacy layouts in the layout options selection menu. Additionally, users can select <strong>Show my full video to others</strong> to prevent their camera feed from being cropped into a portrait tile for others.</p><p>Google says this may come in handy particularly for accessibility: "We encourage sign-language interpreters especially to consider using this feature to ensure that arms and hands are not unintentionally cropped out."</p><p>These features will begin to rollout for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/march-2025-workspace-feature-drop">Workspace</a> customers on rapid release domains starting March 31, 2025, and can take up to 15 days to appear for everyone. Scheduled release domains won't see these Meet upgrades until April 17, and it could take up to three weeks after that for them to appear for everyone. These upgrades are available for both <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/everything-you-need-know-about-google-workspace-spaces-and-smart-canvas">paid and personal Workspace accounts</a>.</p>

<p>A fresh leak just spilled the accessories Samsung might roll out for the Galaxy Tab S10 FE series.</p><p>Samsung hasn’t officially pulled back the curtain on the Galaxy Tab S10 FE or its Plus version just yet, but thanks to leaks and rumors, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-teases-tab-s10-fe-series-rumors-surface">we’ve already got a pretty good idea of what to expect</a>. That said, the accessories for these <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-tablet">budget-friendly tablets</a> have been more of a mystery—until now.</p><p>According to information shared by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2025/03/exclusive-official-samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-fe-plus-accessories-prices.html" target="_blank">Android Headlines</a>, Samsung isn’t making new accessories for the Galaxy Tab S10 FE series. Instead, these upcoming tablets will stick with the existing lineup from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-fe-hands-on">Galaxy Tab S9 FE</a> and S9 FE Plus, with support for four specific accessories.</p><p>As per the outlet, the Galaxy Tab S10 FE Plus will launch alongside four Samsung accessories: an Anti-Reflecting Screen Protector, a Hybrid Book Cover, and two keyboard options (including a slim version). Both keyboards reportedly feature a dedicated AI button that'll fire up Bixby or Gemini with one press.</p>

<p>As for the keyboard folio covers, the Book Cover Keyboard Slim could cost €199 (about $215), and the standard Book Cover Keyboard might be priced at €269 (around $290).</p><p>While both will apparently come with an AI key, the standard version is said to stand out with a built-in trackpad. The Slim model reportedly ditches the trackpad and palm rest for a thinner, lighter design.</p>

<h2 id="spec-sneak-peek-2">Spec sneak peek</h2>
<p>Rumor has it that the standard Galaxy Tab S10 FE may sport a 10.9-inch WUXGA+ display with a 90Hz refresh rate, while the Plus model <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/galaxy-tab-s10-fe-plus-leak-drops-and-suddenly-the-previous-model-looks-tiny">might go bigger with a 13.1-inch screen</a>.</p><p>Under the hood, the Galaxy Tab S10 FE series is expected to run on the in-house Exynos 1580 chip, offering up to 256GB of storage. For cameras, you might be looking at a 13MP shooter on the back and a 12MP selfie cam up front.</p><p>Both tablets should support 45W wired charging, with the standard version housing an 8,000mAh battery and the Plus model bumping it up to 10,090mAh.</p><p>Samsung hasn’t confirmed a launch date yet, but with certifications and benchmarks popping up left and right, the Galaxy Tab S10 FE series looks set to drop pretty soon.</p>

Gone are the days when Beats were promoting fashion over features and a bass-heavy sound signature.</p><p>I've tested every single Beats product released over the past two years, and they're not only excellent options for Apple users — they've also become some of the best price-to-performance audio products for Android fans as well. Now that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-big-spring-sale-2025-best-deals-for-android">Amazon's Big Spring Sale is here</a>, we're seeing some of the best prices on Beats audio gear since Black Friday and Cyber Monday.</p><p>Best of all, competing retailers like Best Buy and Target are getting in on the fun, often with better deals and promotions to challenge Amazon. That's why if you're in the market for new audio gear — whether it be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">headphones</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">earbuds</a>, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-speakers">speakers</a> — there's a massively-discounted Beats product to choose from. After testing them all, I'm going to recommend the best Beats deal in each category.</p><p>If you act fast, you can save up to $100 on the latest Beats gear.</p>
<h2 id="the-best-headphone-deal-beats-solo-4-2">The best headphone deal: Beats Solo 4</h2>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/beats-solo-4-review">Beats Solo 4</a> aren't the best pair of headphones on the market, but you shouldn't sleep on them either. They're all about portability, ease-of-use, and battery life. With a collapsible design, you can fold them up and easily slide them into a bag for safe transport. Solo 4 also weigh just 217 grams, which is a minuscule amount compared to heavier pairs of headphones, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/apples-usb-c-airpods-max-are-getting-an-upgrade-it-shouldve-had-all-along">like the 384.8-gram AirPods Max</a>.</p><p>This makes the Beats Solo 4 the perfect gym or on-the-go companion. Their on-ear design and strong clamping force means they won't fall off during your commute or workout, and at the same time, the soft cushions make Solo 4 comfortable.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You need a lightweight, versatile pair of wireless headphones lasting over 50 hours on a single charge.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You need over-ear headphones with support for active noise-canceling and transparency mode.</p>
<p>For me, the killer features are the Beats Solo 4's versatility and battery life. These headphones last up to 50 hours on a single charge, which should last all week for workouts, commuting, and more. When the battery runs out, Solo 4 can actually run without power using the 3.5mm headphone jack. You have plenty of connectivity options here: 3.5mm wired, USB-C wired, or fast wireless pairing with iOS or Android.</p><p>Of course, there were some compromises made to hit this insane (now discounted even further) price point. The on-ear design may be less comfortable than over-ears for some, and there's no active noise-canceling or transparency mode here. The good news is that if you want all those features, the Beats Studio Pro have them, and they're also $170 off for a limited time. We <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/uh-is-this-a-joke-best-buy-carves-49-percent-off-my-favorite-noise-cancelling-headphones-from-beats">have a full breakdown of that deal here</a> if you want to learn more.</p><p>If you want the very best deal on the Beats Solo 4, Target is offering $100 off, but it requires creating a Target Circle account and going through a few hoops.</p>
<h2 id="the-best-earbud-deal-beats-studio-buds-plus-2">The best earbud deal: Beats Studio Buds Plus </h2>
<p>If you want a fully-featured pair of truly-wireless earbuds on a budget, look to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/beats-studio-buds-plus-review">Beats Studio Buds Plus</a>. They're a revised version of the original Beats Studio Buds with better sound quality and features, inspired by the first-generation AirPods Pro. That's why the Studio Buds Plus are sure to sound great, with an in-ear design that pushes audio straight into your ears.</p><p>Another perk of the Beats Studio Buds Plus is that they're tiny, and that goes for both the earbuds and their charging case. The buds don't have any stems or hooks, so they'll sit nearly flush with your ear when nestled inside. Despite the tiny form factor, you'll get up to nine hours of battery life on a single charge with the earbuds and an additional 27 hours with the USB-C charging case.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You want a tiny pair of earbuds with advanced features and excellent Bluetooth 5.2 compatibility.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You need the absolute best ANC quality, or need earbuds with a wireless charging case.</p>
<p>On top of all that, you get fast pairing with both Android and iOS, and full support for customization and updates with the Beats app for Android. There's ANC and transparency mode support that'll help both block out unwanted noise and let in some of your surroundings. In all, it's going to be hard to find a better set of earbuds at the Beats Studio Buds Plus' discounted $130 price.</p>
<h2 id="the-best-speaker-deal-beats-pill-2">The best speaker deal: Beats Pill</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="UpqChJdW8N4teof9gFCg6R" name="beats-pill-park-bench-center-button.jpg" alt="Beats Pill" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UpqChJdW8N4teof9gFCg6R.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Beats Pill isn't just a speaker. It's also a power bank, with a USB-C port for powering up other devices. You can use it as a beach or pool companion too, with an included lanyard and an IP67 dust and water-resistance rating. And as far as sound quality goes, there's new driver hardware for impressive and full audio with an angled design to push sound right toward your ears.</p><p>But the fantastic thing about the Beats Pill is its price. Right now, it's available for just $100 — that's $50 off its typical retail price. To put that in perspective, the Beats Pill's $149.99 retail price was already a discount. The Pill's predecessor, the Pill Plus, retailed for $230 when it released years ago. So, you're not only getting a better product for $80 less than the previous version — you're also saving $50 on top of that.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You want a portable Bluetooth speaker with great sound and long battery life.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You need a wireless speaker with a 3.5mm audio jack.</p>
<p>There's really only one shortcoming of the Beats Pill, and that's the lack of a 3.5mm audio jack. However, you can use the included USB-C port for audio input and reverse charging, so it's an easy flaw to overlook. That's especially true if you plan to use the speaker wirelessly most of the time.</p><p>For just $99.99 for a limited time, I think most people will be stunned by how better their music sounds coming through the Beats Pill compared to their phone speakers. After all, this product is quite similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sonos-roam-2-review">Sonos Roam 2</a> while costing nearly half the price with this discount.</p>

<p>For Android users, the biggest appeal of buying a Beats audio product is getting the latest Apple features in an Android-friendly package. While <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-pro-vs-airpods-pro-2">AirPods Pro 2</a> or AirPods Max are some of the best headphones on the market, they're not fun to use with Android. By comparison, the Beats Solo 4, Beats Studio Buds Plus, and Beats Pill are all fully-featured on Android. In fact, some of them have Android-exclusive features.</p><p>It's worth noting that Beats' best competitor to the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro</a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-review">Pixel Buds Pro 2</a> is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/beats-powerbeats-pro-2-review">Powerbeats Pro 2</a>, which aren't on sale yet — they just came out last month.

<p>Nothing’s new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">budget phones</a> have a fancy AI button (Essential Key) tied into the Essential Space app. It currently powers tools like Camera Capture, but rumors suggest some AI perks might go premium in the future.</p><p>Currently, the Essential Key and its AI-powered Essential Space app are free to use for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review">Nothing Phone 3a</a> users during its early access phase, but that might not last. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/nothing-essential-space-subscription-3538293/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> dug into the code and found hints that Nothing could be gearing up to charge $120 a year for access.</p><p>For the uninitiated, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/nothing-essential-space-ai-hub-what-pixel-screenshots-should-have-been">Essential Space</a> acts as a smart media hub, storing screenshots and recordings captured using the Essential Key button.

<h2 id="potential-paywall-2">Potential paywall</h2>
<p>Android Authority has uncovered mentions of "free trials" and "AI credits," hinting at a possible paywall. It looks like users might get a taste of certain features for free, but unlocking the full AI experience could require a subscription or buying credits.</p><p>Nothing is already teasing new tricks for the Phone 3a series, like "Flip to Record." It's a handy feature that starts voice recording when you place the phone face down.</p><p>A more profound look into the code hints at two upcoming Essential Space features: "Smart Collections" and "Focused Search." While they’re not live yet, the names suggest Smart Collections could auto-organize content, while Focused Search might offer AI-powered, deep device searches.</p>

<h2 id="one-year-trial-in-the-works-2">One-year trial in the works?</h2>
<p>Buried in the code, there's a mention of a "1 year free trial." This looks like it might only apply to certain new features when they drop instead of the whole Essential Space platform.</p><p>Just because these code hints exist doesn’t mean everything in Essential Space will go behind a paywall. Nothing might roll out a tiered system, keeping the basics free while charging for premium AI features.</p><p>The company has confirmed nothing yet, but the signs are there. Nothing told Android Authority that Essential Space is still in its free early access phase and that no pricing decisions have been made yet. However, the discovered code hints suggest the company is seriously weighing its monetization options.</p>

<ul><li>A few leaked Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE renders surfaced, suggesting the device will continue to rock a tab-like folder cover display design like the Flip 6.</li><li>The phone could see a 3.4-inch cover display with a dual camera array and a slightly smaller 6.7-inch internal screen.</li><li>Previous rumors have suggested a similar stagnant design; however, there is confusion about which Samsung SoC it could feature.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Rumors look to end the week with an alleged look at Samsung's affordable clamshell foldable.</p><p>The supposed look at the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE comes from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sammyguru.com/exclusive-first-look-at-galaxy-z-flip-7-fe-in-360-video-and-5k-renders/">SammyGuru</a> and X leaker OnLeaks. The leaked renderings showcase the phone in a minty green color from a few different angles. From the outside, the Flip 7 FE is suspected to debut with a familiar tab-like folder design for its cover display. Of course, this is reminiscent of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-hands-on">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>. The cut in the display is to make room for the phone's dual camera array.</p><p>Beside those lenses is its LED flash, which echoes that past-gen model.</p><p>Rumors claim the phone will sport a 3.4-inch cover display around a 50MP lens and a 12MP camera. Samsung may continue to feature its "Armor Aluminum" frame around the edge of the phone. Opening it, the post suggests users will be greeted by a 6.7-inch screen. The renders also make it seem like the phone's internal bezels are quite thick, though they're not giving us the best look. These aren't confirmed looks at the phone, so there's a chance its internal screen's experience could look different than this.</p><p>What's more, speculation claims the device will see the following dimensions: 165.1 x 71.7 x 7.4mm. Everything else about the phone's design seems to retain the same design aspects as its flagship predecessor.</p>

<p>A few Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE renders <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-flip-7-rendering-changes-specs-leaked">surfaced a month ago</a>, highlighting details similar to what's come up now. The latest rumors double down on the fact that the Flip 7 FE could mirror the Flip 6's design. Even the alleged camera array could remain the same as we've seen in 2024. There are a couple of key differences: the internal display size and the phone's thickness. It was previously stated the phone would rock a 6.8-inch screen, but that's gone down by 0.1 inches.</p><p>Additionally, rumors now claim the phone will be slightly thicker than its predecessor — which is odd considering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-is-working-on-a-thin-galaxy-z-fold-phone-with-s-pen-support">Samsung's push</a> for thinner devices.</p><p>Rumors are divided about its SoC, with some rumors suggesting the Exynos 2500 while others <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-next-galaxy-z-flip-might-have-a-surprise-processor">claim the Exynos 2400e</a>.</p><p>It's worth highlighting this continuation of the cover display's design as a recent flagship Galaxy Z Flip 7 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/new-galaxy-z-flip-7-case-leak-backs-larger-cover-display-rumor">rumor says it could go immersive</a>.

<hr>
<p>Fitbit is reportedly providing an extension on its upcoming account merge; however, it also comes with a warning to its users about a risk of data loss if they don't comply.</p><p>In a new email from Fitbit, the company is now moving its Google Account merge deadline to February 2, 2026 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/28/fitbit-google-account-2026/">9to5Google</a>). With this, Fitbit says users have until this new date to merge their data from its platform to Google's, lest they incur a data wipe. The email states, "your account and data will be deleted," as well as all "historical data" previously stored by Fitbit.</p><p>The publication states users with "newer devices" (and likely new accounts) don't have to worry about this as this has likely already been done during the early setup stage.</p><p>If you've yet to migrate, head into the <strong>Fitbit app > Settings > Move Account</strong>. Ensure your app is up to date, as this option may not appear otherwise. Once there, the app will run you through everything you need to know/review before moving over.</p>

<p>After some hurdles, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/googles-fitbit-acquisition-finally-complete">acquired Fitbit</a> for $2.1 billion in 2021. A year later, the company announced that it would soon <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-google-account-requirement">begin merging all of its data</a> with users' Google Accounts. The announcement said this change was to improve the user experience as you'd only have a "single login for Fitbit and other Google services, industry-leading account security, centralized privacy controls for Fitbit user data, and more features from Google on Fitbit."</p><p>The merge <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/fitbit-google-account-merge-summer">started in the summer of 2023</a>, and its original deadline was this year, 2025. Joining you in the merge will be your health and fitness history, as well as any wellness data. Security-wise, Google stated the merge should hopefully bring users peace of mind. Not only will its security act as the first line of defense, but you'll also have a range of privacy controls via the Privacy Center.</p><p>Users can manage all of their stored Fitbit data directly from their account's Privacy Center.</p><p>The latest Fitbit email is just <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/fitbit-google-account-transition">one of a few different ways</a> the company has been sending signals to keep its users aware of the merge. It's worth noting that if you don't merge your account, not only will your data get the boot, but you won't be able to access Fitbit's features, either. While you may have until February 2, 2026 to comply, it might be worth moving things over a little before then, just to be safe.</p>

That sounds a little ominous, considering everyone thinks Android is a completely open project. It's not. Android was never as open as you might think, and these changes aren't really a change.</p><p>Google is ultimately in charge of Android's code. Google decides what gets done, how it gets done, and when it gets done. You (or anyone) can contribute to Android, though. Once everything gets wrapped up, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/aosp">"finished" code</a> is posted for anyone to grab and use however they want.</p><p>In this way, Android is open. It uses liberal open-source licenses, which allow other companies like Samsung or Motorola to make changes and never have to share the work with us. You can make those kinds of changes, too, if you like. Please don't.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Android is open, but it's not as open as you think.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>I asked for a public statement from a few Googlers who work on the Android project, but the folks I know well enough to ask can't give me one. Google has rules about who can share information and what they can share, and I don't blame them for it. Heck, they might not even know because big companies love to keep secrets.</p><p>According to the report, Google is supposed to make a formal announcement soon about the change, so we'll have to wait and see if there's any more to this news. But for now, it seems like much ado about nothing.</p><p>Going off the current report, nothing is really changing. You won't be able to look at submitted changes that aren't accepted, and you could never look at what was decided on until the code was released. Remember what I said about secrets? Don't worry, I'm about to explain.</p>

<p>There are two "main" versions of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> right now, just as there were two versions of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>, and there will be two versions of Android 17, too. I'm not talking about slight differences between tablets and phones or anything for wearables, etc, I'm talking about Android itself.</p><p>There is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://source.android.com/docs/setup/about/faqs#how-is-the-android-software-developed">main branch of Android 16</a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://source.android.com/docs/setup/about/faqs#how-is-the-android-software-developed" target="_blank"> and an experimental branch</a>. The main branch is the one you can't see because it's developed by Google. It's also the branch that will be released as the next platform version, and when that happens, every single line will be posted for download. That won't be until Google is finished with Android 16, though.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1442px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:22.88%;"><img id="FRfBGrdxWjywWPxsmbYsAY" name="Android-16-Release-Schedule" alt="The beta release schedule for Android 16." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FRfBGrdxWjywWPxsmbYsAY.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1442" height="330" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Android 16 release schedule. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Then there's the experimental branch. It's where things that may or may not work as intended are placed until the right people can figure out if they are needed and, if so, how they will be implemented. Right now, you can see a lot of it, but the latest says you won't be able to in the future. None of what you see here is part of Android, and it may never be.</p><p>Anyone can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://cla.developers.google.com/about/google-individual">send a software patch to Google</a>, and those get placed in that experimental branch. A large number of these changes are ignored and never make it into an actual release. Working with Google is really no different than working with any other software company; they can't just merge dumb changes into the "finished" product.</p><p>The experimental branch of Android is nothing but a rumor mill. People see a change and tell others about it, and eventually, the rumor is that something will be coming in the next version of Android. This is what is going away.</p><p>I say adios and good riddance. Nobody working on building an actual version of Android that will run on a device pays any attention to the experimental branch. Neither should you.</p>

<p>What you really need to know is that for companies making phones, nothing changes because they often <em>do</em> get to peek at the "private" code before it is released. This goes for security patches as well as platform versions because doing the work once everything is made public means it would take far too long.</p><p>People who build ROMs (custom versions of Android) base their work on the current stable version of AOSP because they want all the non-open parts, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-play">Google Play</a>, to work with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-used-the-gemini-api-and-ai-studio-to-make-the-i-o-2025-puzzle">APIs</a> being used. Nobody wants to use a phone without third-party apps, and all those apps are written to work with the documented stable version of Android. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developers.google.com/android/guides/overview" target="_blank">Especially Google's apps</a>.</p><p>If you've been an Android nerd for a long time and were an HTC fan, you might remember how I got hired here: I made custom ROMs and patched kernels for a lot of phones as a hobby and was willing to help people understand how they worked and how to get them installed.</p><p>It's not anything you can't do, and it's not difficult; it's just consuming. I still do it once in a while and remember why I stopped. Nobody is doing this and basing their work on the experimental branch of Android so they can make it harder.</p><p>What will <em>really</em> change is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/" target="_blank">Reddit rumor mill</a> and clickbait headlines on your favorite Android website — including this one. That's a good thing.</p>

<hr>
<p>There's a little more in store for the latest major Wear OS update, which involves a small update for app awareness.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/25/wear-os-tile-icon/#more-666431">9to5Google</a>, the latest Wear OS 5.1 update makes its new app icon refinement more widespread on the company's Pixel Watch. The small update reportedly concerns Pixel Watch owners swiping through their set tiles on the watch face. Now, your device will display the icon of the app that the specific tile belongs to.</p><p>For example, the publication highlights the recorder tile, which shows the Recorder app's icon "briefly" at the top.</p><p>The icon is said to remain "out of the way," and it only seems to remain in view for a little while before disappearing. Curiously, the publication states this small QoL feature has been around for years, but it seems the most recent Wear OS 5.1 update brought it to devices more profoundly.</p>

<p>Google's Wear OS 5.1 update is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5-1-kicks-off-new-update-strategy-for-pixel-watches">a new dawn</a> for the company's outlook on wearable software. The update, based on Android 15, first arrived for Bluetooth and Wi-Fi-capable Pixel Watches <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixels-march-2025-feature-drop">in the March feature drop</a>. The patch was substantial for those devices as it finally brought the recently FDA-approved Loss of Pulse safety feature, menstraul cycle tracking, and step tracking improvements.</p><p>It wasn't until a couple of weeks later that Google finally brought that same update <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/google-lte-pixel-watches-wear-os-5-1-rollout-spotted">to all LTE-capable</a> devices. Though it was late, owners of an LTE Pixel Watch, Pixel Watch 2, and Pixel Watch 3 grabbed a host of new features alongside upgraded media controls. The patch started rolling out roughly ten days ago today (Mar 28), so if you haven't gotten it yet, give it another check.</p><p>Unfortunately, though Wear OS 5.1 packs a lot of good, it's also been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/wear-os-5-1-seems-to-have-come-with-multiple-bugs">causing a lot of frustrations</a>. The update has reportedly been delaying notifications and causing severe battery issues. Users have come together to voice these issues while stating a band-aid fix could be restarting or factory resetting the affected watch. Google finally chimed in and informed Android Central that they're aware of the problems impacting "a very small number of Pixel Watch users."</p>
