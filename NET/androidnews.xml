Devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x200-ultra-review">Vivo X200 Ultra</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x300-pro-review">X300 Pro</a>, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/i-took-the-find-x9-pro-to-mexico-its-cameras-are-on-another-level-entirely">Find X9 Pro</a> are easily among the best phones you can buy today, and these brands are doing a better job selling their devices outside Asia.</p><p>Looking ahead to 2026, I predict a continuation of the dominance around imaging, with even bigger cameras and better tuning. I also see the likes of OPPO and Vivo establishing a solid presence in Western markets, rivaling Xiaomi and Huawei.</p><h2 id="cameras-that-are-even-better-2">Cameras that are even better</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="2wG7Rvpw2WMXeR8bvZ3PUS" name="Vivo X200 Ultra" alt="Vivo X200 Ultra next to X100 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2wG7Rvpw2WMXeR8bvZ3PUS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you need the best possible cameras on a phone, you'll need to get the Vivo X200 Ultra, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/oppo-find-x8-ultra-review">Find X8 Ultra</a>, or the Vivo X300 Pro — there's no question about that.  With the X300 Pro delivering noticeable gains over its predecessor, where does Vivo take things in 2026? There's obviously going to be an X300 Ultra, and that should also get a 200MP tele lens.</p><p>Where I see Vivo differentiating its Ultra models is with the tuning; this was evident on the X300 Pro, and it's clear that Vivo wants to focus on its tuning algorithms as much as the physical sensors it uses on its phones. That's a good thing, because it allows the brand to meaningfully stand out against its closest rivals.</p><p>In a similar vein, I see OPPO and Xiaomi going all-out with their Ultra models, and I'm excited to see what they can deliver. While Xiaomi was the only brand out of the trio to sell its Ultra models outside China, that may change in 2026, with both OPPO and Vivo set to launch their best phones globally.</p><h2 id="increased-global-presence-2">Increased global presence</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="iQWseiGa6pDLDtoHBwQ3c9" name="OPPO Find X9 Pro" alt="OPPO Find X9 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iQWseiGa6pDLDtoHBwQ3c9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What's the point of having a brilliant phone if it's limited to just a few countries? While Vivo and OPPO focused on Asian markets, that narrative is changing, and either brand is keen on building out a presence in the West. OPPO introduced the Find X9 and X9 Pro in the U.K., and Vivo debuted the X300 and X300 Pro in Germany and other markets in the region.</p><p>While either brand had a limited presence in these countries, they didn't market their products aggressively — that's going to change in 2026. In conversations with both brands, I got the feeling that they're enthused about expanding outside Asia in earnest.</p><h2 id="better-panels-2">Better panels</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="UJrtmQvHNUNAbmwScLopTm" name="Vivo X300 Pro" alt="Vivo X300 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UJrtmQvHNUNAbmwScLopTm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The latest wave of Chinese phones has a meaningful display upgrade: they go down to 1 nit. Chinese manufacturers have closely collaborated with display vendor BOE to deliver this, but the downside is that the resolution is lowered to 1.5K. There's no tangible difference in day-to-day usability between 1.5K and 2K.</p><p>That said, we should get phones with 2K panels that go to 1nit in low-light use in 2026. BOE is doing all the right things in this area, and it's clear that the manufacturer is able to work with phone brands to tailor panels to their needs.</p><h2 id="even-bigger-batteries-2">Even bigger batteries</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4911px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="FApPDYXvSSvCAod9WBcERm" name="Vivo X300 Pro" alt="Vivo X300 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FApPDYXvSSvCAod9WBcERm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4911" height="2766" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>My Find X9 Pro has a 7,500mAh battery, and the phone lasts a day and a half with heavy use. Battery sizes are only going to increase in 2026, with brands set to cross 8,000mAh. This is made possible by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-talked-to-the-brand-thats-revolutionizing-silicon-battery-tech" target="_blank">silicon-carbon tech</a>; the initial wave of phones with these batteries had 10% silicon in the anode, but silicon content is increasing, allowing brands to fit ever-larger batteries into their phones while still retaining a thin-and-light design.</p><p>Silicon batteries are just better; the greater density means the phones aren't bulky, and they hold up much better in challenging weather conditions.</p><h2 id="limited-dram-2">Limited DRAM</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="ZCbrBGUuQLADnfxRtFKtfS" name="Vivo X200 Ultra" alt="Vivo X200 Ultra back view against a grey background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZCbrBGUuQLADnfxRtFKtfS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We got phones with 1TB of RAM and 24GB of RAM, and while these models tend to be limited to China, I don't see this trend lasting. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tech-talk-why-your-next-phone-will-cost-more">meteoric rise in DRAM prices</a> means brands will only deliver 12GB of RAM on their phones in 2026, and that will likely be the case even with 512GB and 1TB storage configurations.</p><p>Whether that's going to be enough in the AI-everything era needs to be seen. As it stands, I don't see any problems with 12GB of RAM on Android, but as more and more brands start switching to on-device AI models, it may turn into a bottleneck. Regardless, if you need 16GB of RAM, you'll want to buy a phone that's available now instead of waiting for a 2026 device.</p><p>I don't see the status quo changing too much with Chinese manufacturers in 2026. OPPO and Vivo will be looking to increase their imaging lead, and while Xiaomi didn't have a strong 2025, I want to see the brand do better next year. Huawei is once again likely to roll out a roster of devices with meaningful innovation (I'm testing its latest products, and they're wild), and Realme is guaranteed to deliver phones with the biggest batteries.</p> ]]></dc:content>

If you buy it before the end of the year, you can choose a free folio case or a free stylus with your purchase.</p><p>At a glance, you’re getting a familiar OnePlus design language wrapped around a more budget-friendly core. The Pad Go 2 features a slim aluminum body, slim bezels, and a large display built for streaming, browsing, and light productivity.</p><p>The screen itself is a big selling point. You’re staring at a massive 12.1-inch LCD display that cranks up to a 120Hz refresh rate. With 900 nits of peak brightness, you can use it even outside on a sunny day, which is unusual for tablets in this price range. While it’s not OLED, it should still work well for daily use.</p><h2 id="solid-mid-range-specs-2">Solid mid-range specs</h2><p>Inside, OnePlus replaced the older Helio G99 with the MediaTek Dimensity 7300 Ultra. It won’t outperform a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, but for streaming, light work, and casual gaming, it does the job well.</p><p>You’re also getting 8GB of RAM and up to 256GB of storage, which you can expand via a microSD slot. That last part is a dying feature, so seeing it here is a genuine win for media hoarders.</p><p>This tablet has a 10,050mAh battery, which is much larger than the 8,000mAh battery in the first-gen OnePlus Pad Go. OnePlus says it can last for over 50 hours of music or 15 hours of video.</p><p>The software is a strong point for the Pad Go 2. It comes with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-oxygenos-16-arrives-as-a-software-that-truly-knows-you">OxygenOS</a> for tablets, which includes split-screen multitasking, floating windows, and better app scaling than standard Android on large screens.</p><p>If you already have a OnePlus phone, features like quick file sharing and synced notifications help the tablet fit smoothly into your setup.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="f169430e-e50c-4728-b2b3-53308f602527">            <a href="https://www.oneplus.com/us/buy-oneplus-pad-go-2" data-model-name="OnePlus Pad Go 2" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WGFhQScxHXASBwNTT2xnCC.jpg' alt="OnePlus Pad Go 2 back panel"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">OnePlus Pad Go 2</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The OnePlus Pad Go 2 brings a big 120Hz display, solid performance, long battery life, and smart software to the US at a price that actually makes sense.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

At the moment, Samsung largely relies on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/gemini">Google Gemini</a> for deeper and complex queries. The company's own Bixby assistant, on the other hand, are limited to basic tasks and commands.</p><p>For some time now, Samsung has been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-explores-perplexity-ai-integration-to-rival-gemini-on-galaxy-s26-series">rumored to be working with Perplexity</a> to give Bixby a much-needed AI upgrade. With this integration, Bixby would continue managing basic system actions like toggling settings or opening apps, while Perplexity would step in to answer more complex, web-backed queries complete with citations, similar to how Apple tapped OpenAI's ChatGPT to handle advanced requests in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-material-3-expressive-vs-ios-26-liquid-glass">iOS 26</a>.</p><h2 id="samsung-looks-to-fix-bixby-s-biggest-weakness-2">Samsung looks to fix Bixby's biggest weakness</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Zu3yHtJwYFXFAddL5xS2oV" name="samsung-bixby-perplexity-leak" alt="Perplexity-powered answers in Bixby" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Zu3yHtJwYFXFAddL5xS2oV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @achultra on X)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The feature was initially rumored to debut alongside the Galaxy S26 series, but signs of it have already appeared in the latest One UI 8.5 beta. A screenshot shared by the user <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/achultra/status/2004884916161704262">@achultra on X</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sammyguru.com/samsung-quietly-boosts-bixby-with-perplexity-ai-in-one-ui-8-5/">SammyGuru</a>) shows Bixby responses clearly powered by Perplexity.</p><p>We weren't able to get the feature working on our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> running the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/one-ui-8-5-beta-official-galaxy-s25-series">One UI 8.5 beta</a>. However, the shared screenshot shows a complex query (involving a French-language question about weather) being answered by Bixby with Perplexity listed as the source.</p><p>Samsung already offers <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/samsung-perplexity-ai-tv-experience-thats-more-than-just-shows">free Perplexity Pro access</a> for Galaxy smartphone users and has been using Perplexity-powered answers on its smart TVs and other appliances. Still, this marks the first time we're seeing signs of that integration making its way to Samsung smartphones.</p><p>While the feature was originally expected to launch exclusively with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy S26 lineup</a>, this early appearance gives us a clearer idea of how the integration will work. If rolled out widely, it could finally give Samsung users a strong alternative to Google Gemini, and we expect to see more developments around this in the coming days.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Even the base-level QuietComforts sport a powerful active noise cancellation suite, however, and this is a worthy price if that's what you need most.</p><p>Not unlike the Ultra model, the base QuietComforts offer Bose's powerful, signature active noise cancellation, along with an ambient mode that's perfect for staying aware of one's surroundings. They also include a solid battery life, fast charging, and an IPX4 water resistance rating. You can currently get this price for the QuietComfort earbuds in Black, White, Petal Pink, and Twilight Blue.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$179.00" data-dimension48="$179.00" href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-New-QuietComfort-Earbuds-Black/dp/B0D8BZDPXB" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:95.47%;"><img id="4r3fNBFjLVfyPXWzoRYmWf" name="bose-quietcomfort-earbuds-product-image" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4r3fNBFjLVfyPXWzoRYmWf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1500" height="1432" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Bose QuietComfort Earbuds:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-New-QuietComfort-Earbuds-Black/dp/B0D8BZDPXB" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$179.00" data-dimension48="$179.00" data-dimension25=""><del>$179.00</del> <strong>$129.00 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>As the holiday season slides into the rearview, some tech deals are still holding on, such as this offer that slashes 28% off the Bose QuietComfort earbuds.

They also have customizable tap control options, an IPX4 water resistance rating, and easy access to EQ and more via the Bose QCE app.</p><p>Purchase also comes with nine different combinations of eartips and stability bands for optimal comfort, as well as wireless charging, spatial audio, and an easy-to-stow charging case that keeps them charging while not in use.</p><p>To be sure, you could consider premium, upgraded options such as the Bowers & Wilkins Pi8 earbuds for an even more robust ANC profile, but you'd definitely have to spend a few hundred extra bucks for an arguably marginal difference.</p> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Artificial intelligence experienced growth in 2025, with companies offering strong challenges to OpenAI for the first time.</p><p>Google used its corporate might to release more AI-powered features than any other company, Meta used its stockpile of cash to acquire top talent, and OpenAI made big bets looking toward the future. At the same time, smaller companies Perplexity and Anthropic took significant strides, but still look more like acquisition targets than serious threats. And then there's Microsoft, a company that may have tied its horse to OpenAI and an AI PC strategy too soon.</p><p>Looking ahead to 2026, I'm predicting a year of reckoning. Multiple companies made promises that they'll have to deliver on next year, like Samsung's smart glasses or OpenAI's upcoming hardware product. Additionally, the results of pending lawsuits and possible AI regulation could loom over the industry in 2026. Here's everything I'm expecting from the AI industry next year, plus what I want to see.</p><h2 id="brand-deals-and-lawsuits-will-set-the-tone-for-ai-in-2026-2">Brand deals and lawsuits will set the tone for AI in 2026</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uZsDWnq2PmSPxmGVuJ2Gjj" name="OpenAI-Disney-deal" alt="OpenAI next to Disney logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uZsDWnq2PmSPxmGVuJ2Gjj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OpenAI)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/ai-2025-report-card">my AI report card for 2025</a>, I noted that it's hard to judge OpenAI's year because the company prioritized its future over its present. The biggest OpenAI move came just a few weeks before the new year — it inked a deal with Disney that'll see the entertainment giant invest $1 billion in equity into OpenAI. As part of the move, OpenAI will get exclusive access to Disney's intellectual property with over 200 licensed characters. Starting in early 2026, users will be able <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/openai-sora-video-generator-vs-google-veo-3">to generate Sora videos</a> with Disney characters.</p><p>It's a big move for both companies, as the three-year licensing agreement gives OpenAI the legal use of Disney characters, with Disney presumably receiving financial kickbacks in return. OpenAI impressively got Disney to throw money its way as part of the deal, too. Perhaps most importantly, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/disney-hits-google-with-a-cease-and-desist-over-ai-copyright-claims">Disney sent Google a cease-and-desist letter</a> over the company's use and generation of copyrighted material by its AI models.</p><p>How this all plays out will certainly guide the AI industry in 2026. For now, I can still generate Disney characters with Google AI models, which raises a ton of questions. Will Disney slap Google with a full-on lawsuit over its alleged copyright violations? Does legal access to Disney material give OpenAI the edge it needs over competitors as the AI race tightens? Is Disney really making enough money from this deal to justify giving up its most valuable assets to an AI company?</p><p>I'm looking forward to all of these questions being answered in 2026. This is just one of the developments involving brand deals and legal challenges for AI companies in 2026. There are multiple lawsuits filed by brands such as the New York Times, Ziff Davis, Thomson Reuters, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sustainabletechpartner.com/topics/ai/generative-ai-lawsuit-timeline/" target="_blank">others</a> that aim to force governments to decide whether training AI models on copyrighted material is legal.</p><p>In 2026, I want to see these legal questions answered, ideally with a bit of much-needed AI regulation in the mix. I'm also curious whether competitors like Google or Meta try to copy OpenAI's deal with Disney — next year could quickly become the race to secure brand deals with IP holders.</p><h2 id="less-ai-slop-and-more-thoughtful-features-2">Less AI slop and more thoughtful features</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="Xo5yF4jw4KQacoCdKnZ63m" name="meta-ai-app-with-donald-trump-ai-slop" alt="An AI-generated video of Donald Trump serving food to other world leaders in the Meta AI app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Xo5yF4jw4KQacoCdKnZ63m.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It goes without saying that not every AI feature is bad, but many are. AI-generated content hit new lows in 2025, prompting Merriam-Webster to select "slop" as its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/wordplay/word-of-the-year" target="_blank">word of the year</a>, defined as "digital content of low quality that is produced usually in quantity by means of artificial intelligence." In 2026, I want to see less slop and more truly useful features.</p><p>Brands, if you're reading this, stop sticking AI where it doesn't belong. I don't need Meta AI in my Instagram search bar or my WhatsApp DMs. I certainly<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-needs-to-stop-the-ai-slop-before-it-kills-its-best-products"> don't need an infinite-scroll feed of AI slop in the Meta AI app</a> required to manage my collection of Ray-Ban Meta and Oakley Meta smart glasses.</p><p>Meta is an underrated player in the AI industry, especially given its NBA-style contracts for top engineering talent, totaling hundreds of millions in compensation over multi-year deals. Next year, it needs to stop getting in its own way. Create thoughtful AI features that users seek out willingly, and remove the slop shoved into apps that are awesome otherwise.</p><p>Meta certainly isn't the only company doing this; it's simply the worst offender. Other AI companies should watch and learn what <em>not</em> to do, making sure to only include features in their best apps that make sense.</p><h2 id="i-want-to-see-what-samsung-google-and-openai-are-cooking-2">I want to see what Samsung, Google, and OpenAI are cooking</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="R3pj7qTnTK5tyddn3thAFY" name="Android-XR-prototype-glasses" alt="A still from the Android Show: XR Edition showing Juston Payne wearing the Google prototype glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/R3pj7qTnTK5tyddn3thAFY.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A still from the Android Show: XR Edition showing Juston Payne wearing the Google prototype glasses. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I mentioned <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a> as something to watch in my AI preview article for 2025, and I'm bringing it up again in 2026. That puts quite a bit of pressure on Google, the one building the software platform, and Samsung, the one curating the hardware. Eventually, the Android XR teasers and demos that keep trickling out aren't enough, and we need to see results. We finally got <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-galaxy-xr">Samsung's Galaxy XR headset</a> in 2025, but I'm looking forward to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/leaked-details-on-samsungs-xr-smart-glasses-transition-lenses-and-built-in-camera">Samsung's upcoming pair of smart glasses</a> even more.</p><p>I use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/which-meta-smart-glasses-should-you-buy">Meta smart glasses</a> because they're the best available right now, in my opinion, not because I'm particularly attached to Meta as a company. If Google or Samsung made a better or comparable pair of smart glasses that fit better into the Android ecosystem, there's a strong likelihood I'd be compelled to switch. That's why, in 2026, I need to finally see what Google and Samsung are cooking up. Are these companies going to challenge Meta on day one, or will their initial offerings feel lightyears behind?</p><p>As for what Samsung's XR glasses could do to win me over, expanded prescription lens support, better open-air speakers, sharper camera quality, and more comfortable frame designs are at the top of my wishlist.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oGfoAaCguzXd9tDSyTwKuR" name="ChatGPT-OpenAI-logo-on-glasses-and-watch.jpg" alt="OpenAI ChatGPT logo on a pair of smart glasses and a smart watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oGfoAaCguzXd9tDSyTwKuR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Oh, and I'd also love to see <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/artificial-intelligence/jony-ive-and-sam-altman-confirm-openai-finally-has-a-prototype-for-its-super-secret-ai-device-set-to-launch-in-less-than-2-years">what OpenAI is working on with Jony Ive</a> on the hardware front. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/ive-tested-gemini-3-and-it-proves-google-has-what-it-takes-to-win-the-ai-race">Gemini is slowly catching up to ChatGPT</a>, and I think it's because Google has products and services people use every day, giving it unparalleled integration avenues. OpenAI can't build the next Android or replace Google Search and Workspace overnight, so its best option is to make an AI hardware product that actually catches on.</p><p>As an iPod kid at heart, I have skeptical faith in Ive. But like Google and Samsung, OpenAI will need to show me something tangible in 2026 to make me a believer.</p><p>AI models like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini 3 </a>and GPT-5.2 are so good these days that the updates are starting to feel incremental. The next thing to watch is how these AI models will be implemented. For example, whether a brand deals with IP holders like Disney or hardware releases like XR glasses will define the next stage of the AI race. Whether the courts or legislators will take any steps to regulate the AI industry or protect copyrighted material.</p><p>In other words, 2026 is going to be an important year for AI, one way or another.</p> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Headphones and earbuds took major steps forward in 2026, with new hardware releases from Apple, Bose, and Sony leading the charge. On the software front, Spotify finally delivered on a years-long promise to make lossless audio available to subscribers. For accessibility, Google built Auracast support right into Android, making the wireless broadcasting standard available on select Google Pixel, Samsung Galaxy, Xiaomi, and POCO phones.</p><p>Heading into 2026, there's still plenty of work to do. Headphones and earbuds like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones-2nd-gen-review">Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2</a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/airpods-pro-3-review">AirPods Pro 3</a> are nearly perfect, but audio software could use better support for high-resolution Bluetooth codecs. Plus, I have an outside-the-box request for Android phone makers and a big concern about how AI-generated content will affect the music industry.</p><p>Here's what I expect to see from the audio industry in 2026 (and everything I hope happens).</p><h2 id="audio-brands-give-us-aptx-adaptive-lossless-all-the-things-2">Audio brands... give us aptX Adaptive + Lossless all the things</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="dfg73ixPDofdxMHJ7LLTXj" name="Fiio BT11" alt="Fiio BT11 Bluetooth 5.4 transmitter" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dfg73ixPDofdxMHJ7LLTXj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While I love seeing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">music streaming services</a> like Apple Music, Tidal, and now Spotify offer high-fidelity lossless audio to subscribers, they won't matter much without the right hardware — and the right software. The fact is, most of us use wireless headphones and earbuds, and the overwhelming majority of them use lossy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bluetooth-audio-terms-codecs-explained">Bluetooth audio codecs</a> that negate the benefits of lossless streaming.</p><p>The frustrating part of this situation is that we've already solved the problem. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/qualcomm-aptx">Qualcomm's </a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/qualcomm-aptx" target="_blank">aptX audio codecs</a> have enabled CD-quality lossless wireless audio transmission with aptX Adaptive and aptX Lossless. Unfortunately, many top Android brands simply refuse to make these codecs available on their devices. That's true even on phones with the hardware required to use aptX Adaptive or aptX Lossless.</p><p>In the U.S., the only major phones with aptX Lossless come from Asus, Sony, and Motorola, and the word "major" is generous for at least two of those brands. International phones from Xiaomi and others are more forgiving on the global market, but aptX Adaptive and aptX Lossless are still too rare on Android phones, wireless headphones, and earbuds.</p><p>In 2026, I'm hoping to see more headphones, earbuds, and phones leverage Qualcomm's complete Snapdragon Sound platform to make wireless lossless audio mainstream. While <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/this-tiny-dongle-brings-aptx-lossless-to-any-phone-and-its-fantastic">small dongles can bring aptX Lossless to any phone</a>, Android users deserve a proper built-in solution.</p><h2 id="make-bluetooth-le-audio-and-auracast-matter-2">Make Bluetooth LE Audio and Auracast matter</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2916px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="vRWD3UZkitrSbW2bPQbNKi" name="audio-sharing-via-bluetooth-auracast-google-pixel-10-pro-lifestyle" alt="Audio sharing via Bluetooth Auracast on a Pixel 10 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vRWD3UZkitrSbW2bPQbNKi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2916" height="1640" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Similar to the point about aptX Lossless, I hope <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/accessories-report-card-2025">Bluetooth LE Audio and Auracast</a> become commonplace in 2026. These standards are groundbreaking and have significant potential, but they need to be widely implemented for users to benefit from them.</p><p>Specifically, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-you-need-know-about-bluetooth-le-audio">LE Audio</a> has the potential to deliver wireless audio signals more efficiently, preserving battery life. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/i-tried-bluetooth-auracast-at-ifa-2024">Auracast</a> is an incredible accessibility tool that can broadcast an audio source to many receivers, like Bluetooth LE Audio headphones or earbuds.</p><p>The idea that Auracast is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/ask-jerry-can-auracast-help-me">only for people who need hearing assistance</a> is a misconception. There are so many clever uses for Auracast, and we've started to see them pop up in 2025. For example, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.victrola.com/products/wave-bluetooth-turntable-with-auracast" target="_blank">Victrola debuted a Bluetooth turntable</a> with both aptX Adaptive and Auracast support. That means you can throw a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_disco" target="_blank">silent disco party</a> with everyone in attendance streaming music from a record player through their own wireless headphones.</p><p>These are the kinds of exciting ways Auracast can be implemented to deliver next-generation audio experiences. And of course, I want to see public infrastructure widely support Auracast so that important announcements are accessible to all. To do that, we need to get the government, companies, and users all on board in 2026.</p><h2 id="higher-quality-open-earbuds-and-smart-glasses-speakers-2">Higher-quality open earbuds and smart glasses speakers</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CDpEzy3miL6fTa2yxGmhxm" name="Meta-Oakley-Vanguard-Prescription-7" alt="Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses with prescription inserts." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CDpEzy3miL6fTa2yxGmhxm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I thought open earbuds and speakers were a gimmick until I tried the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/motorola-moto-loop-buds-review">Moto Buds Loop open earbuds</a> and Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses in 2025. These audio products prove that it's possible to hear rich, high-quality audio without having something directly inside or covering your ear. In 2026, I'm hungry for more.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/best-open-ear-earbuds">Open earbuds</a> have little room for improvement, with the Moto Buds Loop (sound by Bose) and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bose-ultra-open-earbuds-review">Bose Ultra Open earbuds</a> delivering impressive sound. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">smart glasses</a> could deliver better sound, and Oakley Meta Vanguard is proof of that. Vanguard has larger, higher-powered open-air speakers that are six decibels louder than other Meta smart glasses.</p><p>Meta and other smart glasses brands should bring these larger speakers to more styles — even if it means reworking frame designs. After listening to music with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oakley-meta-vanguard-smart-glasses-review">Oakley Meta Vanguard</a>, I can assure you it's worth it.</p><h2 id="more-usb-c-ports-on-android-phones-2">More USB-C ports on Android phones</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="x2aWGzGgHVHFhdUKbX4aXf" name="asus-rog-phone-9-pro-10.jpg" alt="ASUS ROG Phone 9 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/x2aWGzGgHVHFhdUKbX4aXf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Phones are officially music players now, and lossless music streaming is now included with the most popular subscription services. Now, the hardware on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship Android phones</a> needs to change to accommodate lossless streaming. That leads us to my oddball feature request for 2026: phones with multiple USB-C ports.</p><p>This actually isn't as crazy a suggestion as it might seem, because a few phones already have multiple USB-C ports. Specifically, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-9-pro-review">Asus ROG Phone 9 and 9 Pro</a> both offer two USB-C ports. I've made my peace with losing the 3.5mm headphone jack, but it's time that phones regain that wired versatility — and then some — by adding a secondary USB-C port.</p><p>For audiophiles, an extra USB-C port enables connection with wired headphones, USB digital-to-analog converters, and other streaming accessories while leaving a port available for charging. That's crucial, because lossless downloading and streaming consume a lot of battery, and throwing a USB DAC into the mix uses up even more power. Beyond music streaming, an extra USB-C port would make it easier to use accessories like portable SSDs or mobile game controllers while keeping a connector free for charging.</p><p>Again, it sounds wild, but if you asked me whether I'd rather have a siloed S-Pen on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra</a> or an extra USB-C port, I know which one I'm picking.</p><h2 id="unfortunately-we-ll-have-to-keep-dodging-ai-generated-songs-2">Unfortunately, we'll have to keep dodging AI-generated songs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1605px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="uGsRKAq58ok5zxuiCNzH43" name="toro-y-moi-google-io-2025-3" alt="Toro y Moi on stage at I/O 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uGsRKAq58ok5zxuiCNzH43.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1605" height="903" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A DJ making music generated with artificial intelligence at Google I/O 2025.  </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This last one is a <em>prediction</em>, not a wish: it's going to get harder to discern AI-generated artists from real musicians in 2026. If you've been paying attention, this is already happening in 2025.</p><p>Over the summer, a band called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/14/an-ai-generated-band-got-1m-plays-on-spotify-now-music-insiders-say-listeners-should-be-warned" target="_blank">Velvet Sundown appeared on Spotify</a> and gained millions of listeners — except it wasn't a band at all. The artist's popular songs were generated with artificial intelligence, or as the band put it, were created as "a synthetic music project guided by human creative direction."</p><p>AI-generated songs are an easy way for people to "earn" coveted streaming royalties with little effort, and they're only going to get more prevalent over time. With a combination of AI-generated songs, images, and potentially even deepfake music videos, it'll become more difficult to be sure your new favorite artist is a real person or band. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube/youtube-wont-share-streaming-data-with-billboard-in-2026">If you care about supporting real artists</a>, watch out for AI-generated content that goes viral or appears in your suggestions in 2026.</p><p>If there's a theme in my 2026 wishlist for the audio industry, it's that I want brands to make the most of emerging technologies. Bluetooth LE Audio, Auracast, and aptX Adaptive are all neat, but they need to be widely available at the consumer level to make a real difference. And music fans, let's come together in 2026 and avoid listening to the AI-generated content that's bound to keep popping up.</p> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>From the wild popularity of retractable cables to a boom in the Qi2 accessory space, a lot happened this year. As we bid farewell to 2025, I have already set my sights on the future. Based on rumors, patterns, and what we've seen so far, here are a few things I expect to see in 2026.</p><p>Above all else, the whispers and leaks about new battery tech have me most excited. Then there's the very high chance of the S26 series coming with magnetic Qi2, opening the floodgates to the Qi2 world even further. Here's what I think the upcoming year has in store for the mobile accessories world.</p><h2 id="we-might-see-more-solid-state-batteries-in-tech-2">We might see more solid state batteries in tech</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tuPHaVDkhBn62k9zCiCyUZ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-6" alt="The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge with an Anker MagSafe battery pack attached." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tuPHaVDkhBn62k9zCiCyUZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You might have heard rumors that Samsung is considering using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring/samsung-galaxy-ring-2-dream-batteries-rumored">"dream batteries" in the Galaxy Ring 2</a>. This mysteriously named battery tech is none other than solid-state batteries, and there's a good chance we might see more of them in future gadgets and accessories.</p><p>Although very expensive, solid-state batteries have a significant advantage over the standard lithium-ion batteries commonly used today. As Android Central's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/faster-charging-isnt-the-answer-we-need-better-batteries">Jerry Hildenbrand put it</a>, "they have a ton of capacity without being any bigger, are safer, and provide higher output at low battery levels. They're still lithium-based, but solid electrolytes like ceramics don't explode when they get hot."</p><p>If the rumors are true, Samsung will likely use these "dream batteries" in more products beyond just its wearables. This could be the push that the industry needs to stay relevant, and more and more competitors could rush to adopt the standard just to go up against Samsung.</p><p>What's even cooler is the potential of seeing solid-state <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-battery-packs">power banks</a>. Currently, most airlines have limitations on battery pack capacity. But solid-state batteries could change that. Since the tech is much safer, we could see high-capacity power banks receive IATA approval, allowing us to travel with much larger ones in the future.</p><p>While a handful of solid-state power banks do exist, I'm banking on this niche to thrive in 2026.</p><h2 id="maximalism-is-on-the-rise-in-phone-case-brands-2">Maximalism is on the rise in phone case brands</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3902px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="aoFprjayjkZudwhvYMaQCE" name="BURGA-pixel-10-accessories-lifestyle-3" alt="BURGA accessories for Google Pixel 10" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aoFprjayjkZudwhvYMaQCE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3902" height="2195" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Minimalism is out, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.voguearabia.com/article/maximalist-fashion-making-a-return">maximalism is in</a>. And with this new trend, the world of phone cases and phone accessories is also seeing a clear shift. More and more brands with loud, colorful, and bold designs are getting their moment in the sun.</p><p>People are craving unique accessories that let them express their individuality. Crazy phone colors like hot pink and orange are all the rage. Even Apple launched a bright orange phone. Power banks and chargers from name brands like Anker are now available in wide color ranges. It feels like the right time for the phone case industry to go all in on this trend.</p><p>I have no doubt that CASETiFY and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/is-burga-the-new-casetify">BURGA</a> will have more competition very soon. Smaller brands like Velvet Caviar, Wildflower Cases, and Posh Tech are coming up slowly but steadily. Who knows, we might even see the advent of a completely new phone case brand taking the industry by storm?</p><h2 id="weird-and-wacky-gadgets-could-use-e-ink-in-creative-new-ways-2">Weird and wacky gadgets could use E Ink in creative new ways</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="465pC5VqZGqPbF6UFdwkAV" name="bigme-hibreak-pro-vs-onyx-boox-palma-2" alt="A Bigme HiBreak Pro (left) next to an Onyx Boox Palma 2 (right)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/465pC5VqZGqPbF6UFdwkAV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>First we had e-readers, then came <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-e-ink-tablet">E Ink tablets</a> with full-blown Android access. Companies like Onyx Boox and Bigme have further pushed the boundaries of e-paper tech with 4G phones. We've seen wearables using e-paper screens and BMW leveraging <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bmwgroup.com/en/news/general/2022/ixflow.html">E Ink panels in its color-changing concept car</a>. Lenovo offers several laptops with dual displays, one standard LCD and the other an E Ink one. All of this begs the question: What will the next evolution of E Ink look like?</p><p>Smart home brand SwitchBot launched an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.switch-bot.com/products/switchbot-ai-art-frame">AI Art Frame</a> last month, and it made me realize that we have only scratched the surface. The brand's AI Art Frame comes in various sizes, uses the latest E Ink Spectra 6 color e-ink display, and charges via USB-C. Because these frames use e-paper tech, you only need to charge them <strong>once every two years</strong>!</p><p>I wouldn't be surprised if 2026 brought some strange new innovations in this category. In fact, I'm almost expecting it on some level. Imagine the possible applications of E Ink tech that we haven't even thought of yet?</p><p>All in all, 2026 is shaping up to be a very exciting year for the accessories industry. I can't wait to see which of my predictions come true, and which of my expectations are met.</p> ]]></dc:content>

If this happens, Samsung would take a bolder step than Apple’s current SOS-only feature.</p><p>Currently, satellite features on phones focus on emergency safety. Apple’s Emergency SOS and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-samsung-galaxy-s25-series-supports-satellite-connectivity-but-theres-a-catch">similar Android services let you send short texts when you have no signal</a>, but that’s where it stops. Samsung now aims to do more.</p><p>The main reason this is possible is Samsung’s new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://semiconductor.samsung.com/processor/modem/exynos-modem-5410/" target="_blank">Exynos Modem 5410</a>. This chip supports both non-terrestrial networks (NTN) and next-generation 5G in one device. Simply put, it’s designed to communicate directly with satellites while still handling standard cellular networks efficiently.</p><p>Samsung says the modem supports 3GPP Release 17 standards, which is the foundation for satellite-based mobile communication. That’s the same framework carriers and satellite operators are building around globally. The aim is for your phone to stay connected whether you’re in the city, on the road, or far from civilization.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1711px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="oCcqKRxu686udsFX533c7e" name="Exynos-Modem-5410" alt="Exynos Modem 5410" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oCcqKRxu686udsFX533c7e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1711" height="962" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="samsung-tackled-the-power-problem-2">Samsung tackled the power problem</h2><p>Power efficiency is also a big focus for this modem.

OnePlus launched its 13 series at the start of 2025, and now, just before we close the year, we already have the 15 series. Early adopters should rightfully be mad at OnePlus for making their 2025 purchase obsolete within the year itself. Thankfully, OnePlus has made sure this doesn't happen.</p><p>In a strange plot twist, the OnePlus 15 might actually be worse off than the OnePlus 13 series, particularly when it comes to the newly launched <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15r-review">OnePlus 15R</a>. Some things are better, like the waterproofing, processor, and battery capacity, but is it all worth $100 more than the 13R? We're about to find out.</p><h2 id="oneplus-15r-vs-oneplus-13r-design-and-display-2">OnePlus 15R vs. OnePlus 13R: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="DrbgwCR5LwkreLWBS9TfgT" name="OnePlus 15R" alt="OnePlus 15R review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DrbgwCR5LwkreLWBS9TfgT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>OnePlus had an iconic circular camera island design for the past two generations, but that's been traded in for a more generic look with the new 15 series. The OnePlus 15R looks a lot like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-13s-review">OnePlus 13s</a>, the compact flagship from mid-2025. The 15R has a pretty forgettable design, and its colors don't really help it stand out. The Electric violet shade is the only fun color, but that's limited to just one region for now.</p><p>Build quality is solid nonetheless, and the OnePlus 15R comes with an upgraded fingerprint sensor and up to an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">IP69 rating</a> for dust and water resistance. It's thicker and heavier than the OnePlus 13R, which is noticeable. The 15R also misses out on the classic Alert slider, which has been replaced by a customizable "Plus Key" button.</p><p>One of the 15R's big redeeming qualities is its display. OnePlus has used a 1.5K resolution LTPS AMOLED panel, and we've <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15r-display-review">found it to be extremely good</a>. The company is hyping the 165Hz refresh rate, but this is only really usable in a handful of games. Under normal usage, the display runs at 120Hz for the most part. OnePlus uses a custom Panda glass for scratch protection that isn't as impact-resistant as Corning's solution.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rpfFcHfSZwGgVhgaKoCiWo" name="OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13R review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rpfFcHfSZwGgVhgaKoCiWo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The OnPlus 13R is instantly recognizable as a OnePlus device. It's lighter and slimmer than the 15R, making it easier to hold and use for longer periods. It retains the Alert slider, which we've all come to know and love over the years, letting you quickly switch between silent, vibration, and ringer modes.</p><p>The phone uses the older-style optical fingerprint sensor, which is not bad, but it won't be as accurate or quick as the ultrasonic one used in the 15R. The last bit, where the 13R lags behind, is the waterproofing. With just an IP65 rating, the phone is only rated to withstand splashes of water, not heavy ingress or submersion.</p><p>The display of the OnePlus 13R holds up well against the 15R. It's roughly the same size and resolution, and even though the refresh rate is just 120Hz, it can get much brighter, reaching 4,500 nits at peak. OnePlus also uses something called Aqua Touch on the 13R's panel, which essentially lets you use the display normally even if water is on it.</p><p>Between the two phones, based on design alone, I'd pick the OnePlus 13R. It also comes in just two colors, but I think it looks better, and I love the fact that it's lighter.</p><h2 id="oneplus-15r-vs-oneplus-13r-hardware-specs-2">OnePlus 15R vs. OnePlus 13R: Hardware & specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="ZS8ks88Dxp57PZb9kCs4vS" name="OnePlus 15R" alt="OnePlus 15R review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZS8ks88Dxp57PZb9kCs4vS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The OnePlus 15R is one of the first phones to feature Qualcomm's newest value-flagship chip, called the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-compared-the-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5-to-the-snapdragon-8-elite-tensor-g5-and-dimensity-9500">Snapdragon 8 Gen 5</a>. If you're confused about the naming convention, you're not alone. It's a step down from the Elite-branded chips but is also slightly more potent than the 8 Gen 3 chip found in the 13R.</p><p>For starters, it's built on a smaller 3nm node (vs. 4nm), uses Oryon CPU cores similar to those in Qualcomm's laptop chips, and packs newer Wi-Fi and 5G modems. In short, the 15R will deliver higher benchmark scores than the 13R, but for most day-to-day tasks, there shouldn't be any tangible difference.</p><p>The new power-efficient chip and a much larger 7,400mAh battery allow the 15R to achieve much better battery life figures. You can easily use this phone for two days straight without any worry about charging. There's no wireless charging, just like the 13R, but you get 80W fast charging, and the charger comes in the box.</p><p>The OnePlus 15R starts at $700 for 12GB RAM and 256GB storage, and the $800 for 512GB of storage. OnePlus has kept the RAM the same across storage tiers, unlike before. The phone only comes in two colors — Charcoal Black and Mint Breeze.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p><strong>OnePlus 15R</strong></p></th><th  ><p><strong>OnePlus 13R</strong></p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>OxygenOS 16 (based on Android 16)</p></td><td  ><p>Android 15 (up to four OS upgrades)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Charcoal Black, Mint Breeze, Electric Violet (India only)</p></td><td  ><p>Astral Trail, Nebula Noir</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Screen Size</p></td><td  ><p>6.83 inches</p></td><td  ><p>6.78 inches</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Screen Resolution</p></td><td  ><p>2,800 x 1,272</p></td><td  ><p>2,780 x 1,264</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Screen Type</p></td><td  ><p>1.5K AMOLED</p></td><td  ><p>AMOLED</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Refresh Rate</p></td><td  ><p>165Hz LTPS</p></td><td  ><p>120Hz LTPO</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Snapdragon 8 Gen 5</p></td><td  ><p>Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB, 512GB (not expadandable; 512GB only for Charcoal Black)</p></td><td  ><p>256GB (not expandable)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Cameras</p></td><td  ><p>50MP main, 8MP ultra-wide, 32MP front</p></td><td  ><p>50MP main, <br>50MP telephoto,<br>8MP ultra-wide, 16MP front</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Speakers</p></td><td  ><p>Stereo Speakers, Dolby Atmos support</p></td><td  ><p>Stereo Speakers, Dolby Atmos support</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>7,400mAh</p></td><td  ><p>6,000mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Wireless Charging</p></td><td  ><p>No</p></td><td  ><p>No</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Bluetooth</p></td><td  ><p>6.0</p></td><td  ><p>5.4</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Water Resistance</p></td><td  ><p>IP68, IP69, IP69K</p></td><td  ><p>IP65</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Cellular</p></td><td  ><p>5G</p></td><td  ><p>5G</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Size</p></td><td  ><p>163.41 x 77.04 x 8.3 mm</p></td><td  ><p>161.7 x 75.8 x 8 mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>214-215 grams</p></td><td  ><p>206 grams</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The OnePlus 13R is still retailing for the same $600 that it launched at. This is for the 12GB RAM and 256GB storage variant. In some regions like India, you can even get a 16GB/ 512GB variant. Of course, the 13R can also be found at discounted prices during sales, something the 15R won't see for a while.</p><p>The 13R uses Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, which is still a very capable chip from 2024. There is some thermal throttling that kicks in after 30 minutes of sustained load, but this threshold is still better than what we saw on the OnePlus 13. Performance is fantastic, be it gaming or multitasking.</p><p>Battery life is equally good thanks to the 6,000mAh capacity. Just like the 15R, you can expect to go up to two full days before needing to charge it again. Charging time is a bit longer, though, as the 13R uses a single-cell battery vs. dual cells.</p><h2 id="oneplus-15r-vs-oneplus-13r-software-2">OnePlus 15R vs. OnePlus 13R: Software</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="5Yxvqxb3irwcB7NnPFEHaM" name="oneplus-15r-165hz-gaming-call-of-duty-mobile" alt="Playing Call of Duty Mobile at 165Hz on a OnePlus 15R" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5Yxvqxb3irwcB7NnPFEHaM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The OnePlus 15R ships with OxygenOS 16, which is based on Android 16.

I'm not sure what possessed OnePlus to remove it when the 13R was the first R-series phone to get it, and we all loved it for it.</p><p>There's a 50MP main and an 8MP ultrawide on the back, but the front camera is upgraded to a 32MP sensor. The main camera module itself is not bad, but the ultrawide is objectively worse than the 13R. Selfies from the 15R should look a bit better compared to the 13R, but be prepared for worse zoom shots.</p><p>The auxiliary cameras on the OnePlus 13R aren't particularly great either, but the phone still delivers good shots with the primary sensor. The telephoto camera with its 2x optical zoom delivers crisp, magnified photos, something that we thought was lacking with the 15R.</p><h2 id="oneplus-15r-vs-oneplus-13r-the-choice-is-obvious-2">OnePlus 15R vs. OnePlus 13R: The choice is obvious</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="uwZ2aATG2DUJ64LSXaEZyS" name="OnePlus 15R" alt="OnePlus 15R review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uwZ2aATG2DUJ64LSXaEZyS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Android Central's Harish Jonnalagadda couldn't have said it better in his review — don't buy the OnePlus 15R. The improvements given to it simply do not justify the lost features and higher price. Plus, the fact that it looks pretty uninteresting and boring compared to its predecessor is another reason to avoid it.</p><p>The OnePlus 13R is one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">best OnePlus phones</a>, and even though it might lack some raw benchmark performance, it's still a solid value flagship that's not even been around for a full year. I imagine demand for the 13R should spike, which could put it out of stock sooner than expected, so grab one while you can.</p><p>OnePlus seems to have missed the ball completely on its 15 series, and neither phone is especially impressive when compared to its predecessor. It seems the company is trying to pivot the number series towards the mobile gaming audience, which would explain the focus on bigger batteries and faster displays, and the less importance given to the cameras. I guess the sales of the 15 series will decide if the company will continue down this path or revert back to offering proper value flagships.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="5700c699-2d11-4f1d-b944-a70c9968b801">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ktg93UoYYjXreuE4PbAF3o.jpg' alt="An official product render of the OnePlus 15R"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">OnePlus 15R</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Skip this one</strong></em></p><p>The OnePlus 15R isn't a bad phone, per se, but you'll get more value from the OnePlus 13R which was only launched only in Jan of 2025.

The 1,800-nit peak brightness can drop to 1 nit as needed. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15r-review">Android Central's Harish Jonnalagadda</a> says the screen is easy on the eyes. But he notes that it only supports 144Hz or 165Hz refresh rates in six game titles. For everything else, it's a basic 120Hz.</p><p>However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15r-display-review">Nicholas Sutrich adds that after testing the phone</a>, he found it uses the most flicker-free OLED he has ever seen, a huge selling point for those with sensitivities. He loves the brightness and outdoor visibility, both of which he describes as excellent, and appreciates the eye care features. He even goes so far as to call its screen one of the best in OLED tech.</p><p>Available in Charcoal Black or Mint Breeze with Velvet Glass technology, the OnePlus 15R features rounded corners and a redesigned camera bump that OnePlus says helps reduce hand fatigue when you hold the phone for long periods.</p><p>The massive 7,400mAh battery is a huge selling point, ensuring the phone lasts a long time and can run in harsh environments. It's made with OnePlus' Silicon NanoStack technology, with 15% silicon content for better energy density. It also supports 55W SUPERVOOC fast charging with the included charger, but can go up to 80W with the OnePlus SUPERVOOC 100W Dual Ports GaN Power Adapter Lite.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xejUWxjskviwPyExv8p6NY" name="oneplus-15r-lockscreen-green-2_edit_86359457934190" alt="A OnePlus 15R with a Flux Themes forest wallpaper on the lockscreen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xejUWxjskviwPyExv8p6NY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It does not, however, support wireless charging, which is one of the downsides of the excellent flagship <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-review">OnePlus 15</a>. It can retain 80% of its capacity after four years, ensuring long-term battery health. Jonnalagadda says the phone easily lasts for up to two days without issue, and even a day and a half with heavy use.</p><p>Like the OnePlus 15, it's ultra durable, meeting not only an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance, but also IP66, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">IP69</a>, and IP69K. This ensures that the phone can withstand submersion, high-pressure water jets at close range, and higher temperatures. So, from the hot tub to the backyard water gun fight, it can handle it.</p><p>You get 256GB or 512GB storage, the latter only in the Charcoal Black finish, and you can pair it with the Sandstone or hole-pattern magnetic case. You'll get four years of software updates and six years of security updates.</p><p>Overall, Jonnalagadda finds the design to be a downgrade, except for an Electric Violet finish option available only in India. He finds that the Panda glass it uses isn’t as resilient as Corning Gorilla Glass either, despite the tremendous IP ratings.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rY5945qajwXSW5rKd3gTRE" name="Google Pixel 9a" alt="Google Pixel 9a back on a red background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rY5945qajwXSW5rKd3gTRE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Google Pixel 9a comes in Iris, Peony, Porcelain, or Obsidian and employs a composite matte back and satin metal finish. It has a smaller 6.3-inch OLED display with Corning Gorilla Glass Actua and a 2,424 x 1,080 resolution, with a 60-120Hz adaptive refresh rate. It's much brighter at up to 2,700 nits. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">Michael Hicks says in his review</a> that it's comfortable to see outdoors with decent color saturation. While watching videos side by side with the step-up Google Pixel 9, he didn't notice any difference in color accuracy or contrast.</p><p>With hard edges and an IP68 dust- and water-resistant rating, it's the first Pixel device without the traditional camera housing, which affords a larger battery and an ultra-slim design. Hicks opines that the camera housing is almost too subtle, but appreciates that it's so thin that it prevents wobbling and that the phone is incredibly lightweight. The design change was also worth it to cram in a bigger battery.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="jCm4AVyYi3pzUVTSHc6gDE" name="Google Pixel 9a" alt="Google Pixel 9a in-hand view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jCm4AVyYi3pzUVTSHc6gDE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Its battery is above average at 5,100mAh, which easily lasts over a day, says Hicks, even with heavy use, and can stretch to two days with casual use. But that still doesn't hold a candle to the OnePlus 15R. Still, you get a rated 30+ hours per charge, which can be extended to 100 hours, or just over 4 days, with Extreme Battery Saver mode. It supports fast charging, but only at 23W. While it has wireless charging, it's not useful for anything but top-ups and overnight at a snail's pace, 7.5W.</p><p>Get the Google Pixel 9a in 128GB or 256GB storage options, even less than the OnePlus 15R. Both devices are non-expandable, so you'll have to rely on the cloud beyond the internal storage capacities. The Google Pixel 9a does come with a three-month trial subscription to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One</a> that includes additional cloud storage, along with three months of YouTube Premium and six months of Fitbit Premium if you have a companion smartwatch like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4-review">Pixel Watch 4</a>. So, those are some worthwhile incentives.</p><p>Like all the latest Google Pixel phones, you get seven years of software and security updates.

It is the first phone to launch globally with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-compared-the-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5-to-the-snapdragon-8-elite-tensor-g5-and-dimensity-9500">Snapdragon 8 Gen 5</a> mobile chipset, which affords a faster CPU and GPU and better AI performance overall, but is a step-down from the Elite chip in the OnePlus 15. AI is handled by OnePlus AI and the Plus Mind system alongside integration with Google Gemini.</p><p>OxygenOS 16, based on Android 16, is powered by Intelligent AI, which includes the new Plus Mind, Plus Key, and Mind Space. With this feature, you can press the Plus Key or swipe up with three fingers from the bottom of the phone to take a screenshot and store it in the Mind Space. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/mind-space-app-in-oxygenos-16-bridges-oneplus-ai-with-gemini-for-inspiration">Mind Space area</a> is where you can bookmark key things, like ideas, web pages, e-mails, images, inspiration, key dates, or details. You can even save voice notes.</p><p>From there, you can build ideas, even tap into them with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/how-gemini-live-video-support-helped-me-grow-plants-in-the-desert">Gemini Live</a> with a simple prompt to do things like build a trip itinerary based on everything you saved, or a summary for a presentation. The phone comes with a three-month trial to Google AI Pro. Supporting all these AI goodies alongside the processor is 12GB LPDDR5X Ultra RAM. There's also UFS 4.1, which ensures fast speeds when transferring or copying data.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="kSD93LB5dpiQz76SXfTbyS" name="OnePlus 15R" alt="OnePlus 15R review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kSD93LB5dpiQz76SXfTbyS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In terms of usability, the phone has several features designed to ensure smooth navigation. Parallel Processing 2.0 facilitates smoother app switching, navigation, and multitasking. The Touch Response Chip supports a 3,200Hz touch sampling rate, so the phone is responsive to your commands, a key feature for multitaskers, content creators, and gamers. With dual app control, you can open and interact with two apps on the screen at once, a feature great for multitaskers.</p><p>As for gamers, this phone features a high-end cooling system designed to prevent overheating during the most intense activities, like gaming. The 360° Cryo Velocity Cooling System includes a Cryo Velocity Screen Cooler under the display for thermal protection, along with the Cryo Velocity 3D Vapor Chamber to cool down the high-end processor.</p><p>There's also a Cryo Velocity Back Cover for additional cooling. However, Jonnalagadda says all of this doesn't do much to curtail overheating in his experience. What's more, most games are still limited to 60fps, so while the phone performs well while gaming, it finds that it isn't hitting its full potential.</p><p>Sutrich disagrees, however, saying that in the few games he played, like <em>Call of Duty Mobile</em> and <em>Clash of Clans</em>, he was blown away by the smoothness and responsiveness, even with games that don't support the 165Hz display refresh mode. Given these differing opinions, it might be worth trying the phone for a few minutes in-store to gauge how you feel while gaming.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8CKnZh4FwerdcqXvZjxS5d" name="Google-Pixel-9a-Iris-5" alt="The Google Pixel 9a in Iris in the hand." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8CKnZh4FwerdcqXvZjxS5d.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Comparatively, the Google Pixel 9a offers a hefty AI experience as well, with deep integration with Google Gemini. Loaded with Android 15 OS at launch, it's powered by the Google Tensor G4 processor, ensuring a smooth, pleasant experience. There's also the Titan M2 security chip. The 8GB RAM is a step down, but this phone is still pretty responsive and powerful.</p><p>Naturally, it comes with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google Gemini</a> fully built in and all its features, including assistance with everything from writing to snapping pictures, inquiries, and more. There are useful add-ons like Pixel Call Assist, Clear Calling, Call Screen, and Hold for Me. Some new features in the latest Pixel Drop for the Pixel 9a include AI summaries for chats, photo remixing, expanded Scam Detection, and a unified search bar.</p><p>The phone also affords plenty of personalization through things like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/how-use-and-customize-pixel-theme-packs">theme packs</a>, <em>Wicked: For Good</em> ones being the latest offering in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-owners-get-a-whole-host-of-new-features-with-the-november-pixel-drop">November 2025 Pixel Drop</a>. For gamers and multitaskers, there's a larger vapor chamber to keep the phone cool that Hicks says pays off in benchmarks. Also worth mentioning are safety features like car crash detection, emergency SOS, crisis alerts, VPN by Google, an auto-lock option if the phone is lost or stolen, and built-in anti-malware and anti-phishing features.</p><h2 id="oneplus-15r-vs-google-pixel-9a-cameras-and-camera-performance-2">OnePlus 15R vs. Google Pixel 9a: Cameras and camera performance</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="uwZ2aATG2DUJ64LSXaEZyS" name="OnePlus 15R" alt="OnePlus 15R review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uwZ2aATG2DUJ64LSXaEZyS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When it comes to taking photos, the phone cameras have similar feature sets.

It's powered by the OnePlus DetailMax Engine and includes the same features as the OnePlus 15, including Ultra Clear Mode, Clear Burst, and Clear Night Engine. You can also shoot 4K videos at 120 fps.</p><p>Enjoy all the useful photo editing and fixing features you have come to know and love on OnePlus phones, including removing distracting objects, unblurring photos, and even removing reflections.</p><p>Jonnalagadda points out that the OnePlus 15R is missing a telephoto lens, a marked difference from the previous generation <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a> that has a 50MP telephoto lens, making that phone arguably the better option in this department. Overall, he says the phone's cameras don't perform as well as the OnePlus 13R, with the exception of the great selfie camera. He finds the primary camera decent enough, but he can't get over the omission of a telephoto lens.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="6dgg93SEBTUZKThvLeRQBk" name="Google-Pixel-9a-camera-macro-focus" alt="The Google Pixel 9a camera viewfinder, with a close-up of a gnome thanks to the Macro Focus mode." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6dgg93SEBTUZKThvLeRQBk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>By comparison, the Google Pixel 9a has a 48MP wide-angle primary camera, a 13MP front camera, and a 13MP ultrawide-angle camera. It's worth mentioning that it doesn't have a telephoto lens either, but it does have Super Res Zoom.</p><p>Google's photo editing features that leverage AI are where the real magic comes in. There are options like Add Me to add the photographer to a group photo so no one is left out of a shot, Best Take for combining the best expressions from a sequence of photos, and Magic Eraser, Unblur, and more.</p><p>One of the latest features is personalized edits in Google Photos, like removing sunglasses or hats and fixing smiles. But this is done through the Help me edit features in Google Photos, which you can access from other phones, too.</p><p>Hicks says the cameras capture vivid colors and decent detail in good lighting. But without optical zoom and with a smaller sensor that captures less light, it's not as good as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a>. That's to be expected since that device is much more expensive.</p><p>The Macro Focus mode, however, is stunning, activating by default as soon as you get up close to a subject. Image recognition also smartly focuses on the entire subject versus a tiny spot when in this mode. Overall, he says the phone's camera strength is with Macro Focus, and its weakness is with low-light photography and a lack of optical zoom.</p><h2 id="oneplus-15r-vs-google-pixel-9a-which-should-you-choose-2">OnePlus 15R vs. Google Pixel 9a: Which should you choose?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="HN3f8cmAQjM7kQTZYHicNf" name="Google-Pixel-9a-ai-wallpaper" alt="An AI-generated wallpaper on the Google Pixel 9a held in hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HN3f8cmAQjM7kQTZYHicNf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you're choosing between the OnePlus 15R and the Google Pixel 9a specifically, the answer is simple: go with the Google Pixel 9a. Jonnalagadda doesn't mince words when he calls the OnePlus 15R "bland and forgettable," adding that it "isn't worth your time or money." This isn't to say you should ignore OnePlus phones altogether.</p><p>If you're looking for a value option, the previous-generation OnePlus 13R is the better choice and offers tremendous bang for the buck. If you have a bit more dough to spare, upgrade to the OnePlus 15. But between these two devices, the better value is the Google Pixel 9a.</p><p>With that said, you may also want to wait for the rumored <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-10a">Google Pixel 10a</a>, though the Pixel 9a will still be a current phone for some time. It's a solid device that Hicks calls "the Energizer Pixel" and still ranks as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">the best budget Android phone</a>, with the OnePlus 13R a solid second choice. You'd be happy with either of these phones. When it comes to the OnePlus 15R, however, if you take the advice of Jonnalagadda, skip this one and go back a generation or spend a bit more for the OnePlus 15. It's a fantastic device worth the extra few hundred bucks.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="5700c699-2d11-4f1d-b944-a70c9968b801">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ktg93UoYYjXreuE4PbAF3o.jpg' alt="An official product render of the OnePlus 15R"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">OnePlus 15R</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Skip this one</strong></em></p><p>The OnePlus 15R isn't a bad phone, per se.

However, not everyone wants a flagship phone, and for those users, reliable options have long included Samsung's Fan Edition series, while Google's Pixel A-series and, more recently, OnePlus' R-series phones have offered strong value for money.</p><p>That said, the gap between flagship smartphones and these mid-range devices has been shrinking lately.

So, if you're looking for a premium mid-range smartphone, when comparing the OnePlus 15R vs. Galaxy S25 FE, which one is the better fit for you?

One notable detail across all color options is the silver aluminum side rails.</p><p>On the OnePlus 15R, you also get a simple design, though with a slightly larger camera module than the S25 FE despite housing only two sensors.

Samsung has given the S25 FE a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-launch">Galaxy S25 Edge</a>-like treatment by trimming down its thickness, which is quite noticeable.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="DrbgwCR5LwkreLWBS9TfgT" name="OnePlus 15R" alt="OnePlus 15R review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DrbgwCR5LwkreLWBS9TfgT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Galaxy S25 FE measures 161.3 x 76.6 x 7.4mm, while the OnePlus 15R measures 163.4 x 77 x 8.3mm. There is also a clear weight difference, with the OnePlus 15R weighing significantly more than the Galaxy S25 FE at 219g versus 190g.</p><p>When it comes to durability, however, the OnePlus 15R pulls ahead. OnePlus claims the phone carries four IP ratings, including IP66, IP68, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">IP69</a>, and IP69K.

The Galaxy S25 FE is no slouch either, with an IP68 rating that protects against water immersion for a limited time.</p><p>Up front, the OnePlus 15R offers a larger display than the Galaxy S25 FE. It features a 6.83-inch AMOLED panel with a refresh rate up to 165Hz and a peak brightness of 3,600 nits. That said, the glass used here is the slightly less robust Gorilla Glass 7i.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 FE comes with a more compact 6.7-inch Dynamic LTPO AMOLED 2X display that supports up to 120Hz refresh rate. Its peak brightness tops out at 1,900 nits.

While the Galaxy S25 uses the Snapdragon 8 Elite, at least in the U.S., the Galaxy S25 FE relies on Samsung's own Exynos 2400 processor. It is capable enough for everyday use, but it is no match for flagship Qualcomm processors.</p><p>The OnePlus 15R, on the other hand, runs on Qualcomm's latest flagship-tier <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-compared-the-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5-to-the-snapdragon-8-elite-tensor-g5-and-dimensity-9500">Snapdragon 8 Gen 5</a> chipset.

The OnePlus 15R packs a massive 7,400mAh battery with 80W fast charging, which should comfortably last a full day of use.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-fe-vs-galaxy-s24-fe">Galaxy S25 FE</a> comes with a respectable 4,900 mAh battery, which is solid by Samsung standards but small compared to the OnePlus 15R. It supports up to 45W fast charging and also includes Qi2 15W wireless charging, something you do not get on the OnePlus 15R.</p><p>Of course, battery life varies by usage, but if I had to pick one blindly, the OnePlus 15R would be my choice.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BHuZTijDCu3hRigV5AUKZF" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-FE-6" alt="The Samsung Galaxy S25 FE in hands-on photos." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BHuZTijDCu3hRigV5AUKZF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Turning to software, both smartphones run custom versions of Android. The OnePlus 15R and Galaxy S25 FE ship with Android 16 out of the box, with the former running OxygenOS 16 and the latter running Samsung's One UI 8.</p><p>Both offer plenty of features and AI tools designed to make daily use easier, though Samsung's software suite is arguably among the best available on Android. Features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-might-look-like-circle-to-search-on-android-with-this-leaked-feature">Circle to Search</a>, object eraser in the Gallery app, and AI-assisted writing are available on both devices.</p><p>Where the Galaxy S25 FE clearly pulls ahead is long-term software support. Samsung promises up to seven major OS updates for the Galaxy S25 FE, compared to OnePlus' four years of major OS updates for the 15R. There are also additional Galaxy-only benefits, such as wireless Samsung DeX, which lets you turn your phone into a portable computing setup when paired with a monitor and mouse.</p><h2 id="oneplus-15r-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-fe-cameras-2">OnePlus 15R vs Samsung Galaxy S25 FE: Cameras</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5rdejtR6KaGiswQ6FaeZZF" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-FE-3" alt="The Samsung Galaxy S25 FE in hands-on photos." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5rdejtR6KaGiswQ6FaeZZF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Turning our attention to the cameras, the Galaxy S25 FE clearly pulls ahead. It ships with a 50MP primary sensor with an f/1.8 aperture and features like dual-pixel PDAF and optical image stabilization (OIS). This is paired with a 12MP ultra-wide sensor offering a 123-degree field of view, along with an 8MP telephoto sensor that supports up to 3x optical zoom.</p><p>The OnePlus 15R drops the telephoto camera altogether and includes only a 50MP primary sensor with an f/1.8 aperture and an 8MP ultra-wide sensor with a 112-degree field of view.</p><p>Because there is no dedicated telephoto lens, optical zoom is limited to a 2x crop from the primary sensor. As a result, images at higher zoom levels tend to look softer and more grainy from the OnePlus 15R.</p><p>For video, both phones support recording up to 4K at 120 fps, but the Galaxy S25 FE also offers 8K video at up to 30 fps. We have not yet tested the cameras side by side, but based purely on on-paper specifications, the Galaxy S25 FE appears to be the stronger option.</p><h2 id="oneplus-15r-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-fe-which-should-you-buy-2">OnePlus 15R vs Samsung Galaxy S25 FE: Which should you buy?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QqjoMXLeFRd8FHrGZRCMaF" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-FE-7" alt="The Samsung Galaxy S25 FE in hands-on photos." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QqjoMXLeFRd8FHrGZRCMaF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When it comes to choosing between the OnePlus 15R and the Samsung Galaxy S25 FE, it is quite clear that these two smartphones are built for very different types of users.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 FE is a solid choice for anyone looking for a balanced smartphone with a capable processor, a versatile camera setup, long-term software support, an excellent display, and a well-rounded battery and charging experience.</p><p>The OnePlus 15R, on the other hand, is a performance-focused device that may fall behind on cameras but delivers near-flagship performance along with class-leading battery life and charging.

This year finally saw the launch of the app’s long-awaited <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify/how-to-enable-spotify-lossless-audio">Lossless audio feature</a>, which significantly improves the quality of your music when you’re <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify/how-to-enable-spotify-lossless-audio" target="_blank">listening through wired headphones</a> or via Wi-Fi with Spotify Connect. The best part is that it comes at no extra cost to Premium subscribers, despite rumors that it would be its own tier or cost extra.</p><p>Of course, Spotify also continues to update and add features, such as its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify/spotify-ai-dj-takes-requests-in-a-new-way-on-android-with-personal-prompts">AI DJ</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-auto/spotify-jam-arrives-on-android-auto-via-an-update">Jam</a>, and a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify/spotifys-prompted-playlists-lets-you-take-more-control-of-its-algorithm">Prompted Playlist</a> that lets users generate a playlist by describing the kind of music they want. Users can also bring DJ vibes to their playlists with Automix, which creates natural transitions between songs to keep the party going without pauses. Finally, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify/spotify-just-gave-free-users-a-major-upgrade-rolling-out-now">the most significant update for free users</a> came this year when Spotify finally gave them the ability to play and search for individual songs, bringing it a step closer to the premium tier and making it easier to enjoy and share tunes.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-video-streaming-service-netflix"><span>Best video streaming service: Netflix</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="emDQFv5mrjHW3yYWggx2QY" name="Netflix-splash-screen-tablet.jpg" alt="Netflix splash screen on a tablet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/emDQFv5mrjHW3yYWggx2QY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>2025 was a weird year for streaming services.

None of this drama benefited the consumer, of course, but that didn’t stop Netflix from having one of its strongest years yet.</p><p>Even amid <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/netflix-q4-2024-record-revenue-price-hike-report">price hikes</a> and password crackdowns, Netflix continues to dominate the video streaming space, striking that delicate balance between crowd-pleasers and Oscar-worthy feature films. We’re sure to see more battles between the big companies in 2026, but once the dust settles, don’t be surprised if Netflix is the last service standing.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-android-app-gemini"><span>Best Android app: Gemini</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2u42Umpxe3p5YtqGi2Y93V" name="Gemini-Live-Plants-3" alt="Using Gemini Live to grow plants and diagnose problems." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2u42Umpxe3p5YtqGi2Y93V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Artificial intelligence might be a very divisive and polarizing topic, but one thing’s for sure: it’s here to stay.

Think again. Not only did Nintendo release a new Switch game in the form of Pokémon Legends: Z-A, but before that, it surprised many of us by releasing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play-store/google-play-celebrates-its-best-of-2025-winners-for-apps-and-games">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> for both Android and iOS at the tail end of last year, and the game has received a steady stream of updates throughout 2025 to keep players vying for the latest cards and packs!</p><p>The premise is simple and familiar: Open packs of cards, collect your Pokémon, build decks, and battle! Not only that, but you can even trade cards from your collection with friends, while also competing in ranked matches to put your skills to the test. Best of all, it’s absolutely free to do all of this, without you needing to spend a dime.</p> ]]></dc:content>

But reports from Korea say the company still hasn’t decided on the price.</p><p>A report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thebell.co.kr/free/content/ArticleView.asp?key=202512231531467760101250" target="_blank">The Bell</a> says Samsung is having trouble setting prices for its new flagship phones — the Galaxy S26, S26 Plus, and S26 Ultra — because the numbers aren’t working out (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-struggling-set-galaxy-s26-price/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>).</p><p>The main issue is that making these phones has become much more expensive. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-could-increase-price-galaxy-s26-series">Several key parts are getting pricier at the same time</a>, including camera modules, OLED screens, and especially mobile DRAM (memory).</p><h2 id="hardware-costs-are-soaring-2">Hardware costs are soaring</h2><p>IDC <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.idc.com/resource-center/blog/global-memory-shortage-crisis-market-analysis-and-the-potential-impact-on-the-smartphone-and-pc-markets-in-2026/" target="_blank">reports</a> that growing demand for AI data centers has made memory chips harder to get, which is raising prices for everyone. With higher costs, smaller profit margins, and global economic challenges, Samsung has to reconsider its pricing to avoid losing customers.</p><p>Samsung President Roh Tae-Moon is said to be asking suppliers to lower their prices, but there’s only so much they can do. The company is already selling the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/poll-would-you-buy-samsung-galaxy-z-trifold">Galaxy Z TriFold</a> at a loss to show off its technology and gain market share. However, the Galaxy S series is Samsung’s main source of profit, so it can’t afford to lose money on millions of these phones just to keep prices low.</p><p>To deal with these costs, Samsung is using different processors in different models. The standard Galaxy S26 and S26 Plus will likely use Samsung’s own Exynos 2600 chip in some regions. This helps the company avoid paying extra for Qualcomm’s Snapdragon chips.</p><p>However, the Ultra model and, probably, the standard models in important markets like the U.S. will still use Qualcomm chips, and they don't come cheap. Since Samsung can’t stop using these pricier chips, it faces a tough decision: either accept lower profits or raise prices and risk selling fewer phones.</p><p>The official reveal is expected in February 2026. Until then, if you’re waiting for the S26, it’s a good idea to start saving some extra money now. You might need it.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This update overhauls the interface and brings back the popular Photo Sphere experience (sort of), which was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/photo-sphere-returns-to-pixel-phones-but-not-the-pixel-8-series">removed from new devices starting with the Pixel 8</a> in 2023.</p><p>The update was released quietly with Pixel Camera version 10.2, which began rolling out in early December and is now on the Play Store (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/12/24/pixel-8-camera-new-panorama-mode/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). For Pixel 8 owners, this update offers a more intuitive, guided shooting experience with smoother stitches and better results, especially when used with Night Sight.</p><p>This updated panorama mode uses the Pixel's full HDR+ photo system to take individual high-quality frames and stitch them together. This method collects more image data, resulting in higher-quality images and improved dynamic range.</p><p>The interface is inspired by Photo Sphere and uses floating dots to guide you through the capture process. As you move your phone and line up each dot, a small preview appears above the viewfinder to show your progress.</p><p>The system also has a level indicator to help keep your shots straight, which is important for avoiding misalignments that can spoil a panorama.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:392px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:221.94%;"><img id="VnBmzstrSoC5422jgfFNmi" name="Pixel-Camera-Panorama-mode" alt="Panorama mode in the Pixel 7's camera" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VnBmzstrSoC5422jgfFNmi.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="392" height="870" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:392px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:221.94%;"><img id="RQYVL9ENRp3pnQoWZ2DNmi" name="Pixel-Camera-Panorama-mode" alt="Panorama mode in the Pixel 7's camera" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RQYVL9ENRp3pnQoWZ2DNmi.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="392" height="870" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:402px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:216.42%;"><img id="XEnFjesmd6fuFumrDBByji" name="Pixel-Camera-Panorama-mode" alt="Panorama mode in the Pixel 7's camera" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XEnFjesmd6fuFumrDBByji.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="402" height="870" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><h2 id="shoot-any-direction-2">Shoot any direction</h2><p>A standout feature of this update is its flexible capture direction.

The company has also managed to keep up on the software and AI fronts, which are becoming increasingly important as companies race to offer the best integration and most robust feature set.</p><p>As we look to 2026, how can OnePlus build on the momentum of two impressive flagship launches in one year? Here's what I expect and hope to see from OnePlus in the coming year.</p><h2 id="don-t-fall-behind-2">Don't fall behind</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="Ub3Z5PNh3rVRbqffmuHpKi" name="Best of 2025" alt="OnePlus phone launches 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ub3Z5PNh3rVRbqffmuHpKi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-13s-review">OnePlus 13</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-review">OnePlus 15</a> are among the most impressive we've seen from Android OEMs, with large batteries and fast charging speeds, and we'll likely see the latter model take the helm as OnePlus's focus throughout 2026. However, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-16">OnePlus 16</a> will likely launch toward the end of the year, and there are a few upgrades we hope to see that could make or break the phone for some consumers.</p><p>With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/which-google-pixel-10-model-should-you-buy">Pixel 10 series</a> sporting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-qi2-magnetic-charging">built-in Qi2 magnets</a>, we've come to appreciate the convenience of magnetic charging, including the various accessories you can pair with your phone. While we always recommend a smartphone case, it's also nice not to have to rely on one to use the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phone-users">MagSafe accessories</a>.</p><p>But perhaps the biggest change we'd love to see (aside from the return of the alert slider) is a better camera system. While the OnePlus 15 is impressive and technically better than the OnePlus 13, its sensors are inconsistent and fall behind the competition, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x300-pro-review">Vivo X300</a>, making it tough for the company to compete in markets like Asia, where we often see some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-camera">best smartphone cameras</a>.</p><h2 id="oneplus-should-bring-the-nord-series-back-to-the-u-s-2">OnePlus should bring the Nord series back to the U.S.</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="EaxAUdEdRkv4LwUAVVPJi7" name="oneplus-nord-4-1.jpg" alt="OnePlus Nord 4 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EaxAUdEdRkv4LwUAVVPJi7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Outside the U.S., OnePlus offers a wide selection of models, including its flagships and more affordable Nord series. However, in the U.S., the company has only focused on its highest-end model and slightly cheaper R-series, opting for a dual phone launch strategy.</p><p>However, the price point makes OnePlus a bit hard to reach for many consumers. This is where the Nord series comes in; its absence has been felt, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">budget Android phones</a> seem to be dominated solely by Motorola and Samsung.</p><p>OnePlus has proven that it can make a compelling budget phone, but the absence of the Nord series in the U.S. in recent years has been a curious omission to me. After all, a good-looking phone like last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-nord-4-review">OnePlus Nord 4</a>, with decent specs, a larger battery, and faster than a flagship like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> but at half the price, sounds like a phone many consumers would like to buy.</p><p>That sentiment also extends to OnePlus watches like the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oneplus.com/global/oneplus-watch-lite">OnePlus Watch Lite</a>. If OnePlus can bring a watch like this to the States, running Wear OS, I imagine it would be an instant hit at a time when smartwatch prices keep going up.</p><h2 id="oneplus-is-still-lacking-in-market-share-and-consumer-mindshare-2">OnePlus is still lacking in market share and consumer mindshare</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Sy52a53jgazSkxHv9A3msA" name="t-mobile-sign.jpg" alt="T-Mobile sign outside of store" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Sy52a53jgazSkxHv9A3msA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: T-Mobile)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Part of the problem with OnePlus only selling flagship phones is that they're beyond the reach of many consumers. But an even bigger problem OnePlus needs to address in 2026 is more or less the same one I was hoping it would overcome in 2025: its lack of carrier presence.</p><p>As capable of a company as OnePlus is, it still strikes me as odd that it no longer works with carriers in the U.S. to sell its phones. The U.S. is an important market, ruled mostly by carriers, and without presence in brick-and-mortar stores or even on their online storefronts, OnePlus continues to risk fading into irrelevance.</p><p>I would love to see OnePlus return to the U.S. in a big way that doesn't require well-informed consumers to visit a OnePlus website or Amazon. Having its phones available with carriers, rather than just supporting them, will help attract more eyes, which could ultimately lead to more sales.</p><p>It also makes it more appealing to consumers who may be deterred by the high price of a flagship phone, which OnePlus seems insistent on focusing its efforts on in the U.S. Buying through a carrier allows consumers to break up that high cost, which makes it easier to purchase expensive phones since you're not fronting the entire $899 at once.</p><p>That said, this would mean working with more than just one company. Carrier exclusives are mostly a thing of the past and severely limit the reach of an otherwise great phone. No one is switching carriers just to get their hands on a phone, so OnePlus needs to get all major U.S. carriers on board to get its phones in more consumer hands in 2026 and beyond.</p><h2 id="give-us-the-oneplus-open-2-2">Give us the OnePlus Open 2</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="XvocrkJ9NQrCe4fwFr3Pq4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XvocrkJ9NQrCe4fwFr3Pq4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As IDC points out, foldable phones are having their moment, especially as companies make them thinner and add more folds. However, the U.S. market is still quite small, with only three major players: Samsung and Google with book-style foldables, and Motorola with flip phones (alongside Samsung).</p><p>We've been hoping for a OnePlus Open 2 for some time, especially after the highly praised <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a>. It would be the perfect time to return to the foldable space in 2026, and not just with a OnePlus Open 2, but also with a flip phone.</p><p>Oppo has proven that it can offer a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">thin and compelling foldable</a>, and I also loved <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n3-flip-review">its last flip phone</a>.

Motorola launched one of the most impressive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phones</a> we've ever seen, and even launched its own AI suite to compete with the likes of Google, Samsung, and others.</p><p>So, with 2026 right around the corner, there are still plenty of ways I would love to see Motorola improve, especially as Apple and Samsung continue to dominate while the Pixel grows in popularity.</p><p>So with that, here's what I expect and hope to see from Motorola in 2026.</p><h2 id="motorola-may-finally-expand-its-foldable-range-2">Motorola may finally expand its foldable range</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4064px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="koLWjXKCDwQYaL7Ksi9VWd" name="Motorola-Razr-2025-series" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 with the Razr Plus 2025 and Razr 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/koLWjXKCDwQYaL7Ksi9VWd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4064" height="2286" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Given the success of the Razr series and Motorola's growing market share, I fully expect the company to continue focusing on improving its lineup. In 2025, we saw the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/which-motorola-razr-2025-model-should-you-buy">expand the Razr lineup with three models</a>: the base, Plus, and Ultra models. It's a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/razr-2025-series-emulates-samsungs-three-product-strategy">similar strategy to Samsung's S series phones</a>, though Motorola's is slightly different: each model comes with significantly different specs to target different price points.</p><p>With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2026">2026 Razr series</a>, I imagine Motorola will continue this three-phone strategy, although if it does, it should focus on price points and a better way to differentiate the Plus model. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-plus-2025-review">Razr Plus 2025</a> was essentially a relaunch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/one-year-with-the-motorola-razr-plus-2024">Razr Plus 2024</a> with minor adjustments and the same chipset, so it would be nice to see Motorola offer a true upgrade in 2026, perhaps with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-compared-the-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5-to-the-snapdragon-8-elite-tensor-g5-and-dimensity-9500">Snapdragon 8 Gen 5</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Razr Ultra 2026 should launch at a lower price while still offering premium specs, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</a>. Memory prices may make it difficult to lower prices, but Motorola has always done a good job of undercutting the competition. Plus, no matter how good its phones are, I believe Motorola isn't quite at the level it needs to be to demand consumers pay more for its phones than a comparable Galaxy phone.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HKfLwP689ohPYQrdz7QotY" name="motorola-ces-2026-fold-teaser-01" alt="Motorola sent us a teaser package that screams something exciting is brewing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HKfLwP689ohPYQrdz7QotY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On that note, Motorola recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorolas-ces-teaser-package-hints-at-a-moto-fold">teased a book-style foldable phone</a>, which could mean the company is finally ready to take the leap and challenge Samsung in other ways. While we haven't seen any leaks or rumors of a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a>, now is probably the perfect time to jump in, as this form factor has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-foldable-phone-failure-is-over-why-2026-is-set-to-change-everything">finally overtaken flip phones</a> in terms of market share, and there is likely a higher ROI with these devices.</p><p>As for what to expect, I imagine Motorola will use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/the-motorola-razr-2025-lineups-textures-are-a-sensory-delight">alternative materials</a> like vegan leather or even wood to help its foldable stand out against competitors like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-review">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a>.

Plus, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/razr-ultra-ai-key-misses-the-mark-google-and-samsung-should-do-it-better">AI Key feels like a wasted opportunity</a> that Motorola should improve on and include with more phones in 2026.</p><p>While it's unlikely Motorola will abandon Moto AI, the company would do well to take a Samsung-like approach and focus some of its efforts on Gemini integration over its own chatbot. In fact, Motorola can take some of its good ideas and rework them for Gemini.</p><p>For instance, Motorola could give users the option to default to Gemini when using its AI Key, so they can easily call the AI from any screen without remapping the power button. Furthermore, Motorola could let users set Gemini as the AI of choice when using Look & Talk, giving it a unique edge over the Pixel.</p><p>This way, Motorola can still focus on improving other AI features across its UI while leveraging the AI with the most consumer mindshare. Samsung already uses Gemini to help sell its phones, and it would be in Motorola's best interest to do the same.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Instead, they need to offer more clarity and a better understanding of how an average person seeking to buy a new anything will perceive and use these products.</p><p>Here's what I'd love to see change in 2026 — and what's worth keeping.</p><h2 id="give-it-to-me-straight-in-plain-english-2">Give it to me straight — in plain English</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3120px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:54.10%;"><img id="kGztnVvmszZ677UWvKpnm6" name="made-by-google-2025-live-call-translate" alt="Jimmy Fallon demonstrating a call being live translated between English and Spanish" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kGztnVvmszZ677UWvKpnm6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3120" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Too often, companies end up explaining features the way they'd talk to engineers and not, well, us. We hear about "tokens per second," model sizes, or how "Siri now has a deeper understanding of your personal context."</p><p>There's a ton of technical jargon, and not much about how those things show up in the real world. Launch events need to answer questions when explaining a new feature — It comes down to the basics: "Why would I actually need it, when would I use it, and what problem would it solve?"</p><p>If I don't understand the practicality of a new feature and how it would help me in the real world, then what's the point of having some elaborate speech about it?</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8vYerT9fwUABbyeubwDRcX" name="Gemini-Pro-tokens.jpg" alt="Google Gemini Pro's new token count" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8vYerT9fwUABbyeubwDRcX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Take Google's Gemini, for instance: instead of telling me it's faster, smarter, and more "multimodal," tell me whether Gemini can look at a photo I took and explain why it looks bad and how to fix it before I share it. Even Samsung and Apple end up using loads of jargon in their Keynotes.</p><p>Apple loves to show off those emotionally hitting polished stories — the Apple Watch saving a life, the iPhone shooting a fancy music video (with tons of extra gear, post-production edits, of course). Samsung often bombards viewers with so many features so quickly, with little guidance on which actually matter.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HKphYoxGeRE" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>But they skip the messy part: regular people trying to use that same tech and ending up with a terrible photo, bad lighting, or just a picture that looks nothing like the ad. In 2026, I want to see companies balance those magical tales with what these features actually look like for a totally average user. Because great stories definitely make people care, but great explanations push people to buy the product.</p><h2 id="keep-consumer-launches-and-developer-events-separate-2">Keep consumer launches and developer events separate</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="gaw5jJXMpSg8HE5A4v7vqi" name="google-io-ai-google-gemini-capabilities-visualized" alt="All of the Gemini capabilities announced at Google I/O 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v2/t:272,l:0,cw:2048,ch:1152,q:80/gaw5jJXMpSg8HE5A4v7vqi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1536" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-biggest-announcements">Google's I/O </a>and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/why-apple-ar-vr-isnt-ready">Apple's WWDC</a> keep developer updates separate from their launch events, but they sometimes blur the line between the two. For example, this year's I/O featured major product announcements, including the launch of Android 16, a demonstration of Gemini's multimodal capabilities, and a preview of a prototype of Google's XR glasses.</p><p>This mix at an event aimed just for developers is definitely cool. Google's probably trying to get more than just coders interested in I/O, but it's also leaving people confused about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-make-the-most-sense-out-of-google-io">whether they should be glued to I/O</a> or just watch the "Made by Google" for consumer-focused announcements. If you ask me, I'd say keep the two separate, don't overcomplicate it. That way, the audience knows what to expect at each event and won't miss anything of interest.</p><h2 id="keep-the-live-demos-even-if-they-fail-2">Keep the live demos — even if they fail</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KxKLpJ72BRc" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Both Google and Meta actually tried live demos in 2025, and sometimes, despite practicing it a zillion times before D-day, they don't go as planned. WiFi dropped, or connectivity lagged, leading to awkward pauses during a live show.</p><p>But that necessarily isn't failure. While people pick on these moments to criticize the company, make a ton of memes, they can also work to the company's favor. It showed us the reality that mistakes happen — especially with common issues like connectivity problems, and this to me comes across as more authentic and raw, rather than scripted videos.</p><p>It also gives companies a real-world moment to look at what works and what still needs work before a product reaches consumers.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZLkh1PDsOCM" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>So, for 2026, companies should totally keep the live demos. But they could try to swap out the celebrities for everyday people to make things more relevant for someone watching on their couch at home. You know, parents, students—those who don't care about the techy buzzwords but who will actually be using these cool new devices and features.</p><p>And just keep things simple, to the point, showing us how features will help normal people, rather than over-the-top shows with so much going on that people forget about it as soon as the show's over.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It truly made the biggest comeback last year, but now it’s time to show the world how it really is the best Android manufacturer.</p><h2 id="focus-on-hardware-and-focus-the-hardware-2">Focus on hardware, and focus the hardware</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8256px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vfdeGuDnjLPcDdkqgma7YK" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-titaniumsilverblue-s25plus-navy-s25-icyblue" alt="The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, Galaxy S25 Plus, and Galaxy S25, next to each other." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vfdeGuDnjLPcDdkqgma7YK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8256" height="4644" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While the company had some of the best launches in 2025, I still think it struggled with being organized.</p><p>Launching the S25 Edge was purely to compete with Apple, but no one wants a thin phone that compromises performance. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-developing-galaxy-s26-after-all">Reports surfaced that due to poor sales</a>, the company began reducing production and started heavily discounting the phone.</p><p>And now<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-galaxy-s26-edge-dead-before-launch"> </a>reports indicate that the company has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-galaxy-s26-edge-dead-before-launch">scrapped plans for the S26 Edge</a>, and a senior Samsung executive reportedly told a South Korean publication that the company wasn’t “sure if the slim line will ever return, but as of now, it seems unlikely. It’s practically gone.”</p><p>I think in 2026, Samsung needs to focus on keeping a tight lineup of phones it knows will deliver the same success it saw in 2025. Launching its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26-your-ultimate-guide">flagship S26 lineup</a>, followed by the company’s next generation of foldables (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-8">Galaxy Z Flip 8</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-8">Z Fold 8</a>), and its more affordable A-series, should be the standard.</p><p>But even with this standard lineup of phones, we’re seeing reports that Samsung might only stick with the Galaxy S26 base, Plus, and Ultra models, dropping the edge variant and removing the “Pro” label for the base to keep the lineup traditional.</p><p>This move seems to make sense because if it were to launch the base model with a “Pro” suffix, it would have to bring Pro-level features to the phone.

We need a Pixel Flip!!!!</p><p>While I understand companies have launched a fold because the ROI is far greater for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> than what can be made from the sales of a flip, there’s some merit in reaching a large audience and a flip phone can do that. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">Flip phones</a> are cute, compact, easy to use, and user-friendly.

Earlier this summer, parents sued Open AI, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/openai-sued-for-allegedly-contributing-to-teen-suicide">alleging the company’s ChatGPT contributed to their teen’s suicide</a>.</p><p>Stories like this makes my heart ache.

We saw the rise of social media in 2007 and the fall of social media in 2016. I know we are going to hear more disaster stories come out of AI’s follies, but here’s my please to you Google, let’s try to help humankind succeed instead of tearing it apart.</p> ]]></dc:content>

But what you don’t realize is that these are the products that add flavor to our personality.</p><p>While I go back and forth between using a case and not, this year, I learned about a bunch of phone case brands that really are trying to redefine what a traditional phone case looks like.

The brand offers some of the most affordable cases for the best smartphones, and it's very consistent in what it puts out. If you have no idea what phone case to buy, you can't go wrong with anything from Spigen.</p><p>The brand’s lineup is also pretty versatile, with clear cases, magnetic options, rugged numbers, and a growing number of smartwatch accessories and add-ons such as phone holders and wallets. Spigen absorbed its sister brand Caseology in January 2025, further solidifying the brand’s image as a case maker with a little something for everyone.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="paqpnzHePGeMGKax2ZrNEn" name="OnePlus-15-Thinborne-case-inside" alt="The Thinborne case for the OnePlus 15" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/paqpnzHePGeMGKax2ZrNEn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Runner-up:</strong> Thinborne</p><p>As for the runner up, Thinborne came in second place this year. Although this Texas-grown case manufacturer prices its creations pretty steeply, the quality is undoubtedly premium. If you need an impossibly thin case that can take a beating and still manages to include a magnetic ring inside, Thinborne has what you're looking for. Almost every phone case from the brand is priced over $60, but I promise you, this small business does not play around. It is absolutely worth the splurge.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="i6RAnGe2ZohPsZPMVBjMxE" name="BURGA-pixel-10-accessories-lifestyle-9" alt="BURGA accessories for Google Pixel 10" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/i6RAnGe2ZohPsZPMVBjMxE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Honorable mention:</strong> BURGA</p><p>It's unusual for me to mention a third option when talking about the best case makers of the year, but I feel like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/is-burga-the-new-casetify">not mentioning BURGA</a> would be a crime. This Lithuanian brand has put itself on the radar and has offerings comparable to well-respected players in the industry, such as CASETiFY. The designs that BURGA offers are so unique and fun, and every product has a personality.

Some of the headphones mentioned above may sound better, but none implement ANC quite as effectively as Sony and Bose.</p><p>Between the two, Sony edges out Bose very slightly due to its slightly better handling of high-frequency noise cancellation, and some listeners prefer its app’s much deeper customization options to Bose’s more minimalist offering. Sound is all about preference, though: Sony is more neutral, while Bose is warmer in the bass and sub-bass frequencies. Both are excellent choices and have been market leaders in wireless ANC headphones for years, so it really boils down to preference. There’s no bad choice here!</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-wireless-earbuds-airpods-pro-3"><span>Best wireless earbuds: AirPods Pro 3</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8WDxM8sZjKayJLvuEtz3Lo" name="Apple-AirPods-Pro-3-review-3" alt="The AirPods Pro 3 with their charging case at a park." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8WDxM8sZjKayJLvuEtz3Lo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It was an excellent year for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">wireless earbuds</a>, with new models from Apple, Bose, Beats, Samsung, and Google leading the charge. Out of all of the options, Android Central’s top pick is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/airpods-pro-3-review">AirPods Pro 3</a>. They’re affordable (we’ve already seen AirPods Pro 2 discounted to less than $200) while adding improved ANC and a new design.</p><p>Even if you live outside the Apple ecosystem, it’s hard to ignore the excellence of the AirPods Pro 3. The ear tips use a hybrid foam-and-silicone design for better fit and sound isolation, while the earbuds themselves feature new vents for airflow and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/airpods-pro-3-feature-want-google-samsung-to-copy">built-in heart rate monitor</a>.</p><p>Apple’s bold claim for the AirPods Pro 3 is that they pack “the world’s best ANC of any in-ear wireless headphones,” and you know what? It’s probably true. If they fit right and you find them comfortable, the AirPods Pro 3 offer the strongest active noise cancellation of any earbuds I’ve tested.</p><p>However, the fit still isn’t perfect for everyone, despite Apple switching things up here.

Anker's chargers and power banks are heat-efficient, intelligent, powerful, and compact. All you have to do is look at their portfolio, pick something based on your needs, and you can trust whatever you pick to serve you well for a good few years.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3709px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="SUaSdew48BxqcdGb52aVGL" name="INIU Pocket Rocket P50 Power Bank" alt="INIU Pocket Rocket P50 Power Bank" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SUaSdew48BxqcdGb52aVGL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3709" height="2086" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Honorable mention:</strong> INIU</p><p>If you are looking for an alternative, INIU is a fantastic underdog in the game.

I take it literally everywhere I go. Having access to 45W charging, a tiny USB-C charging cable, and 10,000mAh to top off my Pixel 10 Pro twice in such a cute little form factor is a <em>dream</em>.

A new year means new stuff, new features for the stuff we already have, and new companies doing new things. 2026 will give us all of this, but maybe a bit differently than we're accustomed to or expect.</p><p>The tech market depends on more than just good ideas and fast chips — the economy is a driving factor, and that will dictate what we see in the coming year. Combined with supply constraints, I expect all manufacturers to sell fewer products in 2026 than in 2025. Here's why.</p><h2 id="ai-will-never-die-2">AI will never die</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2900px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="g4Q8xJWPsVq4ErZUgk9b5P" name="Snapdragon-8-Elite-Gen-5-keynote-AI-everywhere" alt="Cristiano Amon on stage with "AI everywhere" behind him" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/g4Q8xJWPsVq4ErZUgk9b5P.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2900" height="1631" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One thing that isn't going to change is the breakneck pace of companies racing to outdo each other and "corner" the AI market. It's extremely expensive to keep rolling out the infrastructure, but it's equally lucrative. For every million spent, more than a million comes back.</p><p>Some of it will be beneficial; expect breakthroughs in medicine and healthcare, or even ways to farm the food we eat more efficiently. Some will be terrifying: laser guidance weaponry with AI targeting and all the science fiction you can think of.</p><p>Some may actually be helpful for us.

I can see a company with access to cheap labor finding a way to build the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones-under-400">$400 flagship-level phone</a> again when the Apples and Samsungs of the world want well over a thousand.

Packing it full of features, both the existing ones we love to use and all the new ones they love to tell us about, is one way to do it.</p><p>Unfortunately, another approach is to exclude those features from products with lower profit margins. We already see this on some level; the new features of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a> would be fine running on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-9-one-year-later">Pixel 9</a>, but Google wants you to spend $999, so it holds them back.

It's their pride and joy, showcasing what the company is capable of in one sleek, beautiful package. I'm not a fan of everything Samsung does, but as a phone nerd, I love the company's Galaxy S Ultra because it does it all.

The issue ties back to the cost.

Maybe you don't buy a new gadget in 2026 because they can't stay in stock, or you can't/won't spend more on one. That's not a big issue — get ready to do it in 2027!</p> ]]></dc:content>

The Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus, one of our favorite Chromebooks period, is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-15-6-with-google-ai-amoled-display-intel-core-3-8gb-memory-256gb-storage-neptune-blue/J3ZYG24W5G"><strong>still chilling with a $150 discount following Best Buy's big Christmas sale</strong></a>, which means you can get the versatile laptop for as little as $599.99 today. </p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review">Galaxy Chromebook Plus</a> boasts an ultra-thin and lightweight design with a stunning display and 8GB of RAM, and buying the laptop through Best Buy will land you a full year of the Google One AI Premium plan at no additional cost.

Grab the laptop before Best Buy's Christmas sale comes to a close and you'll score a straight $150 off your purchase. The retailer will also throw in a full 12 months of the Google One AI premium plan. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-15-6-with-google-ai-amoled-display-intel-core-3-8gb-memory-256gb-storage-neptune-blue/J3ZYG24W5G" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="35b61e5f-9bf4-40cb-b0ba-280c4f3a8382" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$749.99" data-dimension48="$749.99" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p>Straight out of the box, the first thing you'll notice about the Galaxy Chromebook Plus is its sleek and lightweight build. The laptop clocks in at just under three pounds with 11.8mm of thickness, but you still get a gorgeous 15.6-inch AMOLED display and a ton of ports along the side, including HDMI, dual USB-C, and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-micro-sd-card-android">microSD card</a> slot. </p><p>The Galaxy Chromebook Plus is just as impressive under the hood, with 8GB of RAM, an efficient Intel Core 3 100U CPU, and up to 13 hours of battery life on a single charge. The laptop also comes with a few useful features that you might not expect, such as a backlit keyboard and Samsung's handy Quick Insert key. As I mentioned above, buying the device from Best Buy also lands you 12 months of the Google One AI Premium plan, which means you get to enjoy all of the latest Google AI software features alongside 2TB of free cloud storage. </p><p>The only real problem with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-laptops">Samsung laptop</a> is that you're limited to 256GB of storage, plus you're missing out on a few modern features that you may want, such as a touchscreen display and a fingerprint scanner. Whether that's a dealbreaker or not is up to you, but for most folks, this is a Chromebook deal that's worthy of some serious consideration. </p> ]]></dc:content>

According to reports, there will be two variants, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/oneplus-turbo">Android Headlines</a> has now published images of the lower-powered model.</p><p>The device shown is said to carry the codename "Prado" and follows a familiar design language seen on recent OnePlus phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-vs-oneplus-12">OnePlus 15</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/no-limits-the-oneplus-15r-empowers-android-users-with-flagship-performance-huge-battery">OnePlus 15R</a>. It features a rectangular camera module in the top-left corner housing dual cameras. The phone appears to have a glossy back with a blue-greenish finish, though it's unclear whether the material is plastic or glass.</p><h2 id="this-new-oneplus-phone-is-built-around-a-massive-battery-2">This new OnePlus phone is built around a massive battery</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AMDv7uUETBPC57jbG8gkdL" name="oneplus-turbo-1" alt="Leaked images of OnePlus Turbo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AMDv7uUETBPC57jbG8gkdL.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="e2riSrKtePmqBNXDG5pNdL" name="oneplus-turbo-2" alt="Leaked images of OnePlus Turbo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e2riSrKtePmqBNXDG5pNdL.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Unsurprisingly, the phone looks noticeably thick, which makes sense given the massive 9,000mAh battery inside — larger than what you'll find in some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/holiday-walmart-android-deals-last-chance-2025">Android tablets</a>. Despite its size, the design remains fairly minimal, especially when compared to more aggressive-looking gaming phones from brands like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/redmagic/redmagic-just-dropped-a-gaming-phone-with-a-literal-water-cooler-inside">RedMagic</a>.</p><p>As for specifications, this variant is said to pack the full 9,000mAh battery along with support for 80W fast charging. On the front, you're looking at a 6.8-inch 1.5K display with a 144Hz refresh rate. Powering the device is the Snapdragon 7s Gen 4 chipset, paired with 8GB of RAM, while the higher-end variant could come with the more powerful Snapdragon 8s Gen 4, as previously rumored.</p><p>Android Headlines also suggests that OnePlus plans to launch the phone outside China, potentially under the Nord branding, though it may skip a U.S. release altogether. Considering no Nord-branded phones have launched in the U.S. in recent years, that seems plausible.</p><p>As for timing, OnePlus is reportedly targeting a Q1 2026 launch, which means we could see the device debut around MWC 2026 in March. We should learn more about the device as we get closer to the launch.</p> ]]></dc:content>

You can always make a new account and set up forwarding, so that emails sent to your old account land in your new inbox, but there is currently no easy way to change your Gmail username itself. That finally looks set to change.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://t.me/PixelHubUpdates/4453">Google Pixel Hub on Telegram</a>, a recently updated Google Account <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/19870?dark=0&sjid=13129471057818824497-NA&hl=hi#zippy">support page</a> states that: "If you'd like, you can change your Google Account email address that ends in gmail.com to a new email address that ends in gmail.com."</p><p>The feature appears to be in early rollout, and oddly enough, the support page currently only shows up in Hindi, which suggests Google may have jumped the gun on publishing the information before the feature is officially live.</p><p>Once the update rolls out fully, Gmail users will reportedly be able to switch to a new @gmail.com username while keeping everything intact. That includes access to all account data, emails, messages, photos, and connected Google services.</p><p>Better yet, Google will let users continue using both the old and new Gmail addresses for signing in, sending emails, and receiving messages. In simple terms, your old Gmail will not be deleted or suspended. It will become an alias.</p><h2 id="what-happens-to-your-old-gmail-address-and-data-2">What happens to your old Gmail address and data</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5472px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GUs6ZKiyd2bJdRk2rFiemA" name="google-pixel-tablet-review-gmail.jpg" alt="Gmail app on Pixel Tablet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GUs6ZKiyd2bJdRk2rFiemA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5472" height="3078" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>According to the page, when a user chooses a new Gmail address, all data, including emails sent to the old address, will remain accessible. Users will also be able to receive mail on both email addresses, and no one else will be able to claim your old username.</p><p>There are some limitations though. Users will reportedly be able to choose a new Gmail username only once every 12 months. You will also only be allowed to change it three times after the original address, meaning a total of four possible Gmail usernames can be linked to a single Google Account.</p><p>Once available, the process to change your Gmail username will be fairly straightforward. You will need to head to the Personal info section of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://myaccount.google.com/google-account-email">My Google Account</a>, where you will find the option labeled Change Google Account Email Address. From there, you should be able to enter the new @gmail.com username you want to use.</p><p>The feature has not begun rolling out publicly yet, but the support page being updated this early almost always means a launch is imminent. We'll be keeping a close eye on it and will update once the feature officially becomes available.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The company's foldable smartphone that turns into a 10-inch tablet is turning heads. However, like all foldable phones, durability has always been a major concern.</p><p>With a device that folds not once but twice, the concern only grows louder. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/@JerryRigEverything">YouTuber JerryRigEverything</a> has now put the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-release-date">Galaxy Z TriFold</a> through his infamous durability test, and unfortunately for Samsung, the results were far from good.</p><p>In the video, Zack begins by demonstrating the phone's built-in sensors that detect incorrect folding. Just like we experienced in our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-hands-on">hands-on time with the device</a>, the Galaxy Z TriFold vibrates and displays a warning message if you attempt to fold it the wrong way.</p><p>The test then kicks off with the scratch test. The outer display scratches at level 6 on the Mohs scale, the same result as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>, with deeper grooves appearing at level 7. The inner flexible panel, however, is a completely different story. Because it uses a plastic-based folding screen, it scratches at level 2 and Zack notes the inner foldable screen can be easily and permanently damaged by fingernails, keys, or coins.</p><h2 id="galaxy-z-trifold-struggles-when-pushed-to-its-limits-2">Galaxy Z TriFold struggles when pushed to its limits</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0p_LmbcqEV4" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Unfolded, the Galaxy Z TriFold is just 3.9mm thick at its thinnest point. But that incredibly thin frame leaves almost no room for structural reinforcement, and this becomes very clear during the bend test.</p><p>When pressure is applied in the opposite direction, the Galaxy Z TriFold snaps almost immediately. The frame buckles, the hinges shift out of alignment, and the device is permanently destroyed on camera. This officially makes it the first Samsung foldable to fail JerryRigEverything's structural bend test.</p><p>Zack then proceeds with a teardown of the device. Inside the phone are three individual batteries spread across its three folding segments, combining to a total capacity of 5,600 mAh. The teardown also reveals no thermal paste or specialized cooling hardware, suggesting Samsung is relying entirely on the thin aluminum frame for heat dissipation.</p><p>While the results are disappointing, they're not entirely unexpected for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-vs-huawei-mate-xts">trifolding phone</a>. With so many components packed into an incredibly slim chassis, there's little room left to reinforce structural rigidity.</p><p>That said, Samsung does claim that the hinge mechanism is tested to withstand up to 200,000 folds, which roughly totals to about five years if unfolded 100 times daily, so as long as you're careful with how you use and fold the device, you should be perfectly fine.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Sure, we've seen plenty of cool face computers from Meta, RayNeo, and even Snapchat make impressive strides in smart glasses design, but I think it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-unveils-the-future-of-xr-new-features-for-galaxy-xr-and-upcoming-smartglasses-teased">the partnership between Xreal and Google</a> that's going to really showcase the next evolution in XR we've been craving.</p><p>In short, I think Xreal's Project Aura will be the holy grail people have been asking for, bridging the gap between immersive (but bulky) VR headsets and lightweight (but limiting) smart glasses. Android Central editor Michael Hicks <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-tried-google-samsung-ai-glasses-prototypes-before-android-show-xr-edition-heres-what-i-learned">got to try them in early December</a>, and his impressions offered me the hope I've been longing to see.</p><h2 id="aura-farming-2">Aura farming</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2233px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="mpzwD6hGFTyofSbqWTpXdi" name="project-aura-tease" alt="Project Aura glasses teased" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mpzwD6hGFTyofSbqWTpXdi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2233" height="1256" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Xreal Project Aura is going to totally revolutionize XR headsets as we know them when it launches in 2026. We don't have a price or a specific release date yet, but I'm pretty confident they'll launch at a lower price than Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-galaxy-xr" target="_blank">Galaxy XR</a>, and I fully expect to see them on shelves before summertime.</p><p>Project Aura is special because it's truly the perfect combination of XR tech into one device. If you've used a pair of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-one-review">Xreal One</a> glasses before, you'll understand how well they work and how comfortable they are to wear for long periods. Now, imagine those glasses with a substantially wider field of view and Android XR built in, and you'll understand why this is such a big deal.</p><p>There's been a lot of upselling of smart glasses by many outlets over the years, claiming that the latest pair "replaces the Apple Vision Pro" or some such similar nonsense. That's simply not been the case until now because smart glasses, no matter how good they have been, do not normally come with a proper operating system. Even ones that do are usually rudimentary and clunky.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="hY49GwQinBftKNAfqgetnn" name="samsung-galaxy-xr-floating-windows-chrome-official" alt="Three floating windows in an Android XR mixed reality environment with Chrome in the middle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hY49GwQinBftKNAfqgetnn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="562" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>But Aura is powered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a>, the same operating system that powers the $1800 Galaxy XR. No compromises, no silly limitations. This is the smart glasses dream that's been promised for so long, and it's coming in a form factor that won't feel weird or embarrassing to wear in public.</p><p>And I can already see the massive shift Aura is causing in the industry. Meta has already hired two of Apple's lead designers and restructured its Reality Labs division to focus on making the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-reality-labs-budget-2026-quest-4">Quest 4 as light and agile as possible</a>. Meta isn't even trying to compete with Android XR's vision right now <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-reportedly-scraps-horizon-os-partners-to-focus-on-the-quest">because it wants to focus</a> on making the best first-party hardware possible, and to me, that means making a Quest 4 that's more like a pair of smart glasses than what we currently think of as a VR headset.</p><p>We won't be seeing a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-4">Quest 4</a> in 2026, but the competition Meta will face from Google and its Android XR partners will ripple through the industry, as we saw when the Quest 2 launched in late 2020.</p><h2 id="letting-off-some-steam-2">Letting off some Steam</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YYhHjrsCYPFecRPcehw5R4" name="steam-frame-pcgamer-gameplay" alt="PC Gamer's own Tim Clark takes the Steam Frame for a spin in standalone mode." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YYhHjrsCYPFecRPcehw5R4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: PCGamer)</span></figcaption></figure><p>So where does that leave current VR headsets? Trucking right along, really. VR headsets will remain the best way to play VR games until the Quest 4 rolls around and potentially changes that paradigm, but until then, two options will be the best choice for VR gamers.</p><p>The Quest 3 and 3S have solidified themselves as the best way to play VR games today, and the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/steam-frame-steam-deck-meta-quest-3">Steam Frame</a> headset from Valve is about to evolve the industry in yet another direction. Steam Frame, like the Meta Quest, is a fully functioning VR console that's meant to be played anywhere. It's a Steam Deck for your face, and it'll likely mark the first time we can officially play Half-Life: Alyx without a PC.</p><p>That's all made possible by Valve's brilliant engineering, which translates software and hardware architectures to make it possible to play Windows VR games on a Snapdragon-powered headset. It's the evolution of the technology that enabled the Steam Deck's Linux-based OS to play Windows games, and I fully expect it to blow people's minds when it lands in early 2026.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ib4A3btSQEZQCwhzVdyVWc" name="steam-frame-pcgamer-removable-compute-unit" alt="The removable compute unit of the Steam Frame" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ib4A3btSQEZQCwhzVdyVWc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: PCGamer)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That, of course, leaves Meta in another very weird position. While the Quest is the de facto standalone VR headset and will remain with the largest library of bespoke and exclusive VR games for years to come, Valve's new entry will be the first viable alternative since the original Oculus Quest launched in 2019.</p><p>Sure, HTC and Pico have offered some level of competition, but those companies faced significant hurdles in delivering a Quest-grade VR console that Valve won't. The biggest stumbling block for future Steam Frame owners is that Valve isn't making any new VR games. They're fully focused on making it easy for developers to make games for the Frame, and that seems to be taking up all of the company's attention for the time being.</p><p>It's going to be an extremely exciting year, with two massive shifts happening at once, and it's going to set the stage for years to come!</p> ]]></dc:content>

The top of the top was Xreal One Pro, launching a brand new optics stack that made them not only slimmer but also widened the FoV to new records. That builds upon the excellence that Xreal One delivered with its dedicated X1 chip that provides spatial tracking for any device it's plugged into, a first for any pair of XR glasses and a key differentiator between Xreal's products and any other on the market.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QEU5Xs8NSYTNdwSfZsnMsB" name="Samsung-Galaxy-XR-gesture-controls" alt="A photo of the author doing a two-handed pinch-to-zoom gesture while wearing the Samsung Galaxy XR headset." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QEU5Xs8NSYTNdwSfZsnMsB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Runner-up:</strong> Samsung Galaxy XR</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-galaxy-xr-hands-on-impressions">Galaxy XR </a>is Samsung's first VR headset in years, and it's the first product to launch with Android XR, a brand new version of Android built for the next era of spatial computing devices. While the price will certainly keep some people away, there's no denying how good these displays look and how polished the Android XR experience looks, especially compared to Meta's software. It's got a few bugs that need squashing (and will be as the platform matures), but the fact that you can install any Android app or game on it without any nonsense or modding is a massive win for Samsung and Google.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-new-single-player-vr-game-marvel-s-deadpool-vr"><span>Best new single-player VR game: Marvel's Deadpool VR</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Dw9ZwhaRiWST43qGDuUxRG" name="Marvels-Deadpool-VR-key-art" alt="Deadpool's upper torso with the crown of his head open and little cartoon figures of Deadpool and foes fighting around his shoulders, with the logo "Marvel's Deadpool VR" next to him." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Dw9ZwhaRiWST43qGDuUxRG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Twisted Pixel / Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Every year, Meta's official Oculus Studios developers drop a major release, and this year's blockbuster release is none other than <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/vr-games/marvels-deadpool-vr-hands-on">Marvel's Deadpool VR</a>. The game comes from Twisted Pixel Games and debuts an original Deadpool story with a star-studded cast that includes Neil Patrick Harris, John Leguizamo, Brina Palencia, and more.</p><p>But don't just rely on the big names to sell you on it, because the game puts you in every situation Deadpool might find himself in, with arms flying, swords clashing, bullets spraying, and more. We can't decide if the levels themselves or the bosses are a bigger spectacle, but either way, you'll have an amazing time embodying Deadpool like never before. Plus, you'll never forget the first time you look down and find your arms missing. It's a real mind job!

The jump to VR-only means this still looks and feels like a Thief game, but the immersive nature of physically moving around transforms the gameplay in a meaningful way.</p><p>You play as a new protagonist, but the special part is that the mechanical eye you find at the beginning of the game allows Garrett, his original voice actor, to guide you through the story. You'll sneak around in proper Thief fashion, climbing walls, scaling buildings, hiding in the shadows, taking out guards, and even sabotaging environments, all while stealing as much loot as you can find in each level. It's a stealth gamer's dream and a real treat for Meta Quest gamers!</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-new-multi-player-vr-game-demeo-x-dungeons-dragons-battlemarked"><span>Best new multi-player VR game: Demeo x Dungeons & Dragons: Battlemarked</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:426px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.34%;"><img id="8sn4MbQT5hXLXD46TstD5n" name="demeo-x-d-and-d-mixed-reality-gameplay" alt="Fighting battles in mixed reality in Demeo X Dungeons & Dragons: Battlemarked for the Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8sn4MbQT5hXLXD46TstD5n.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="426" height="240" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When the original Demeo launched on the Oculus Quest in May 2021, I immediately wanted a D&D-licensed and expanded version of the game. That's exactly what Demeo x D&D: Battlemarked is. The game uses the familiar turn-based strategy RPG roots of both <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/demeo-hands-on">Demeo and Dungeons & Dragons</a>, combining two powerful IPs into one impressively complete package that's easy as pie to play with friends.</p><p>To make that even better, it now only supports cross-platform play between Meta Quest, Steam, and PlayStation, but VR players can seamlessly play with non-VR players without hassle. Now that's a D&D night done right, and it makes this tabletop strategy game our multiplayer game of the year!</p><p><strong>Runner-up: </strong>Forefront</p><p>Forefront can quickly be summed up as "Battlefield VR." With support for 32 players, it's one of the most complete VR multiplayer experiences available, and we're not surprised since it comes from the developers of Breachers, a previous VR multiplayer GOTY. As you might expect from a Battlefield-like game, you won't just be running around shooting other players with guns.</p><p>You'll be piloting jet skis, boats, jeeps, ATVs, helicopters, tanks, and more. And since it's in VR, communication with your team isn't just limited to voice. You can use full body language to plan attacks and feel more like you're on the battlefield than ever before.</p> ]]></dc:content>

In 2025, Mobvoi hasn't announced anything official, but it seems to have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ticwatch/mobvoi-removes-ticwatches-from-sale-potentially-leaving-wear-os-behind">stopped selling TicWatches</a> and pivoted to AI devices, while Tag Heuer quietly left the platform with its new Calibre E5. And OnePlus has fallen months behind its pledge to update its 2024 watches to Wear OS 5.</p><p>By my count, Wear OS has four active brands remaining: Google, Samsung, OnePlus/OPPO, and Xiaomi. I'd guess that Xiaomi or OnePlus will be the next to quietly distance itself from Wear OS, releasing more watches with proprietary software, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oneplus.com/global/oneplus-watch-lite">OnePlus Watch Lite</a> running an RTOS.</p><p>Whether by design or neglect, Google's non-Samsung partners can't keep up on Wear OS version updates, falling a year behind on average, and that makes their watches seem deficient compared to Pixel and Galaxy Watches. I'm still expecting a OnePlus Watch 4 until I'm told otherwise, but we're trending toward Google and Samsung hoarding Gemini on smartwatches for themselves.</p><h2 id="gemini-upgrades-will-be-the-wear-os-7-highlight-2">Gemini upgrades will be the Wear OS 7 highlight</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3514px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="8Choy7Jzqxrcy9apc2nrra" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-4-Gemini-Raise-to-Talk" alt="Gemini Raise to Talk on the Pixel Watch 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8Choy7Jzqxrcy9apc2nrra.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3514" height="1977" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a> was a much more dramatic, system-level update than <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-4">Wear OS 4</a>, with Material 3 Expressive as the highlight. I'd expect Wear OS 7 to optimize this new UI rather than change it again, with improved battery efficiency and further upgrades to Watch Face Format like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/wear-os/wear-os-6-will-bring-facer-back-onto-android-watches">3D Faces</a>.</p><p>Instead, I think Wear OS 7 will focus on AI upgrades. Wear OS 6's on-watch smart replies — recently enhanced on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/december-pixel-watch-4-update-adds-one-handed-gestures-and-upgrades-gemini-shortcut">Wear OS 6.1</a> — are the template. The idea is to shift more work away from your phone, so the AI assistant can answer questions more quickly without relying on the cloud.</p><p>I wonder if we'll get an official Gemini Live tool on Wear OS, for situations where it's not convenient to have your phone on hand. I could also see Google creating a Gemini equivalent to Apple's Workout Buddy, synced to your Fitbit training plan; it would give you real-time, personalized feedback and advice during an activity.</p><h2 id="next-generation-hardware-2">Next-generation hardware</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="753wRPDvAPADLF554pLHz6" name="snapdragon-wear-01.jpg" alt="A Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear chip inside of a smartwatch with a bokeh background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/753wRPDvAPADLF554pLHz6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of my big hopes for 2025 was a powerful <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/snapdragon-w5-gen-2-revealed-with-satellite-sos-but-no-major-power-boost">Snapdragon W5 Gen 2</a> SoC with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/what-is-risc-v">RISC-V architecture</a>, based on an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/qualcomms-next-wear-os-chipset-could-arrive-in-2025">interview with a Qualcomm VP</a> where he mentioned their goal of making "AI-driven" hardware with a "week's worth of battery life" and the ability to support years of updates.</p><p>Instead, the Gen-2 chip we got was a more incremental upgrade, focused on improved efficiency and satellite connectivity. It's perfectly functional, but not especially fast, even for everyday app and menu loading. Samsung's 3nm Exynos W1000 is more advanced for everyday performance, but I wouldn't count on it for next-gen AI capabilities, either.</p><p>The sooner we get a true next-generation smartwatch chip with the neural processing for powerful on-watch AI, the happier I'll be. Maybe Google could even make a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/upcoming-pixel-watches-could-play-it-safe-and-i-dont-like-it">Tensor chip</a> with stronger neural performance, as one leak suggested.

It didn't share other details, except for its internal name "Galaxy Watch 9 Ultra." Whatever it's called, Samsung needs to make the Ultra 2 <em>much</em> more exciting to justify the $650 price tag, now that cheaper Galaxy Watches have stolen its look.</p><p>For one, I'd demand a battery boost: The 590mAh capacity hasn't changed since the Watch 5 Pro, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-review">OnePlus Watch 3</a> lasts nearly twice as long. For another, LTE alone isn't that exciting when the Apple Watch Ultra 3 has 5G and satellite connectivity. If its MicroLED tech isn't ready for a smartwatch, Samsung still needs to give the Ultra 2 display <em>something</em> to stand out, like a higher PPI ratio.</p><p>Ultra watches are meant for the outdoors, but the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> never really delivered the training software necessary to attract athletes; anyone willing to spend $650 would spend even more on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Garmin Fenix 8</a>. Samsung started off with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-running-coach-galaxy-watch-8-is-cool-idea-held-back-by-hardware-and-execution">Running Coach</a> this year, but it needs to do more to keep pace with Apple and Google/ Fitbit, instead of relying on third-party fitness tools like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-announces-ifit-partnership-with-galaxy-watch-integration-and-six-month-demo">iFit</a>.</p><h2 id="upgrade-the-pixel-watch-5-to-match-the-new-fitbit-coach-2">Upgrade the Pixel Watch 5 to match the new Fitbit Coach</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ReQt7HNf2JKsWow7hoJ4fN" name="Fitbit-Premium-Health-Coach-Today-tab" alt="A photo of the Google Pixel Watch 4 sitting next to a Pixel 9a open to the Fitbit app, showing the Fitbit Premium Health Coach preview with the Today tab open; it shows new widgets and insights." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ReQt7HNf2JKsWow7hoJ4fN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We already know the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/fitbit-personal-health-coach-preview-hands-on">Fitbit Personal Health Coach</a> will launch in 2026 with AI-generated coaching and health insights. But the Wear OS Fitbit app is still quite basic, unable to import most workouts (besides running) from Gemini's training plans. You have to log things like gym reps manually.</p><p>If lightweight <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watches</a> can sync workout plans from the Connect app and automatically track exercise reps, I'd assume Google can do the same with more powerful Snapdragon hardware! It's just a matter of implementing Fitbit Coach's plans and insights directly in Wear OS 7.</p><p>I've also waited for years for Google to offer a Google Maps course creation tool, where you build a route, export it as a GPX file to your Pixel Watch, and then follow it during a run, hike, or bike activity. The Galaxy Watch Ultra can import GPX files from other apps; Google could one-up Samsung by actually letting you create them.</p><h2 id="a-oneplus-watch-4-with-its-own-software-surprises-2">A OnePlus Watch 4 with its own software surprises</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="TCgSwHtMYzc5evRGzgoX7" name="oneplus-watch-3-fitness-rings" alt="A OnePlus Watch 3 with fitness rings on the screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TCgSwHtMYzc5evRGzgoX7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For OnePlus, 2025 was all about hardware upgrades. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-vs-watch-2">Compared to the Watch 2</a>, the Watch 3 added a titanium bezel, a working crown, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/most-android-flagships-are-getting-an-exciting-battery-upgrade-in-2025">denser silicone-carbon battery</a>, a larger and brighter display, an upgraded coprocessor with better background task performance, and two new health sensors. It essentially caught up with other premium smartwatches.</p><p>Ignoring my Wear OS pessimism and assuming a OnePlus Watch 4 is coming in a couple of months, I don't need more hardware upgrades, really. I just want to see if OnePlus's spin on Wear OS 6 has a standout feature, compared to Google's Material 3 Expressive and watch face theming, or Samsung's phone-like multi-info Tiles.</p> ]]></dc:content>

I was so impressed to see how many companies came out with watches that had new features, better performance, and an overall vision of having a better outlook on what we use the smartwatch for.</p><p>Jumping right in, Google is taking the win with the best Android smartwatch. The company’s Pixel Watch 4 outshone what it means to be a great smartwatch.</p><p>For a second year in a row, the Oura Ring 4 takes the win for best smart ring, and how can you deny that?? It truly is the best smart ring out there, and with added features, your quality of life can be improved so much more.</p><p>Read on ahead to learn what our colleagues have to say about the best Android smartwatch of the year, but of course also about smart glasses, and the best smart ring!</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-smartwatch-google-pixel-watch-4"><span>Best smartwatch: Google Pixel Watch 4</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1651px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="K7DK3Weevo23e9nAfkQdWa" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-4-Moonstone-stretch-band-official-lifestyle-1" alt="The Pixel Watch 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/K7DK3Weevo23e9nAfkQdWa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1651" height="929" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Pixel Watch 4 dominated the staff vote, with only a few Galaxy Watch 8 or Garmin picks. People are impressed with how many upgrades Google packed into this thing: the classy domed display, the significant battery boost paired with top-tier charging speeds, the accurate and efficient dual-band GPS, the satellite SOS, and the Material 3 Expressive UI redesign that feels much more Pixel-like.</p><p>Having reviewed and loved the Pixel Watch 4 myself, I could go on! But the main point is that, four generations in, Google is still focused on innovation and upgrades, while more established brands like Apple and Samsung have fallen into comfortable rhythms and rarely make such <em>dramatic</em> changes year over year. Plus, the Pixel Watch 4 experience should keep improving as Google upgrades the Gemini assistant experience and Fitbit AI coaching.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-smart-ring-oura-ring-4"><span>Best smart ring: Oura Ring 4</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4021px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="kVqcyBEzxFJTCpBhDGLPDX" name="Oura-Ring-4-Ceramic-07" alt="Oura Ring 4 Ceramic in hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kVqcyBEzxFJTCpBhDGLPDX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4021" height="2261" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Oura continues to dominate the smart ring category, and while the Oura Ring 4 launched in the latter half of 2024, the company has not slowed down, launching massive updates to the hardware and software. The new Oura Ring Ceramic is a beautiful piece of hardware for those of you who want a more classy-looking wearable, and the newly revamped Oura app adds touches of Apple’s Liquid Glass UI design while invoking a calmer overall design to really hone in on the wellness aspect of the product.</p><p>Oura also leaned into AI this year with the launch of the Advisor, an AI-powered chatbot that helps you understand your metrics and can chat with you about your stats. You can even track meals just by taking photos of them, letting the Oura app determine what you ate and how it may contribute to your overall health.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-smart-glasses-ray-ban-meta-gen-2"><span>Best smart glasses: Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="xNEGWsXdX57MRnXNYWetqX" name="Ray-Ban-Meta-Gen-2-close-up-front" alt="A photo of the Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) smart glasses sitting on a rock, close up of the front lenses and camera cutouts." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xNEGWsXdX57MRnXNYWetqX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>After a very successful two-year run, Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses got their first sequel, and Meta seemingly did everything right. Fresh styles are paired with excellent camera upgrades that both boost resolution to 3K and deliver substantially better video stabilization. Not only that, but the glasses feature double the battery life of the original release, plus new features like conversation focus, better microphones, and even better speakers with Dolby Atmos Surround support for an amazing audio experience. Oh, and don't forget the fact that Meta updates these basically every month with a new feature, and you get a pair of AI glasses that can't be beat.</p> ]]></dc:content>

If you have been thinking about upgrading your Google storage or trying out the company's AI features, this could be a good time to do it.</p><p>Google shared details of the offer in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/GeminiApp/status/2003573036818342260">post on X</a>, highlighting the discount on its top-tier Google AI Pro plan. While the post focuses on the premium tier, the company is also offering the same 50% discount on its more basic <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One</a> plans, including the entry-level 100GB option.</p><p>Under this promotion, the basic 100GB Google One plan is discounted to $10 for the entire year, down from its usual $20 price. The 2TB storage-only plan is also available at half price, dropping to $50 annually instead of the regular $100.</p><p>These plans are ideal if you primarily want extra cloud storage for services like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-drive-update-makes-navigating-pdfs-and-files-effortless">Google Drive</a>, Gmail, and Google Photos, but they do not include access to Google's full suite of AI features.</p><h2 id="google-one-is-cheaper-right-now-but-only-for-some-2">Google One is cheaper right now, but only for some</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Cmp5dXiSM6rmM8MFqjHNGX" name="Google-One-AI-plans" alt="A Pixel 9a sitting next to an Android figurine showing the Google One AI Pro and AI Ultra plans." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Cmp5dXiSM6rmM8MFqjHNGX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you are looking for storage plus AI tools, Google is also discounting its Google AI Pro plan by 50%. The annual price of this tier is now $100, down from $200. Along with 2TB of shared storage across Google services, the AI Pro plan unlocks a more complete set of AI features.</p><p>Subscribers to Google AI Pro get higher usage limits for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini 3 Pro</a>, access to the latest Veo models, and additional AI tools such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-antigravitys-rate-limits-are-changing-amid-incredible-demand">Antigravity</a> and Gemini CLI. The plan also includes access to Google's new Google Home Premium Standard plan at no extra cost.</p><p>Until now, free access to Google One benefits was mostly limited to Pixel phone owners and students. If you don't fall into either category and have been curious about Google One or Google's AI offerings, this promotion makes it significantly easier to try them out without paying full price.</p><p>It is worth noting that this deal is only available to new users. However, there is a workaround if you really want to take advantage of the discount.</p><p>You can sign up using a new Google account and then add your existing email addresses to the Google One family plan. Since family sharing is supported on these plans, you can still access the storage and AI features at half the usual cost.</p><p>You can claim the new Google One promotions <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://one.google.com/ai-nye">using this link</a>. It is worth noting that these offers are typically time-sensitive and will likely be available only until around New Year's Eve.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This update focuses primarily on stability rather than adding new functionality.</p><p>As per the official changelog, Android 16 QPR3 Beta 1.1 fixes an issue that caused some apps to crash immediately on startup (Issue <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/470144317">#470144317</a>, Issue <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/470214834">#470214834</a>). Google lists this as a change addressing problems where certain apps would fail to launch correctly.</p><p>The new build bumps the version number to CP11.251114.007, up from CP11.251114.006, and comes in at roughly 58 MB in size. It is available for a wide range of Pixel devices, starting from the Pixel 6 series and extending all the way up to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-series-your-ultimate-guide">latest Pixel 10 lineup</a>. If your device is already enrolled in the Android Beta Program, the update should arrive as an OTA download.</p><h2 id="android-16-qpr3-beta-1-1-fixes-an-annoying-app-crash-bug-2">Android 16 QPR3 Beta 1.1 fixes an annoying app crash bug</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qH5fdXGbaGx5Gc7zkBs29X" name="Android 16" alt="Android 16 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qH5fdXGbaGx5Gc7zkBs29X.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-qpr3-beta-1-quietly-upgrades-pixel-phones-where-it-counts">first Android 16 QPR3 beta</a> introduced a handful of notable changes. One of the biggest additions was the option to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-allow-pixel-remove-at-a-glance-widget-home-screen">disable the At a Glance widget</a> from the home screen, something Pixel users have been asking for years. Google also added the ability to swap the back and recent buttons when using three-button navigation.</p><p>Another standout change introduced with QPR3 Beta 1 was improved flashlight controls. Instead of a simple on-or-off toggle, the system now lets you adjust the brightness level of the flashlight, similar to iPhones.</p><p>If you want to try out the latest Android 16 beta, make sure your Pixel is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-install-android-beta">enrolled in the Android Beta Program</a>. OTA updates have already started rolling out, but if it has not appeared on your device yet, you can sideload the update or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/16/qpr3/download-ota">flash the factory image manually</a>. Alternatively, if you prefer waiting it out, the stable release of Android 16 QPR3 is expected to arrive sometime in Q1 2026.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Recently, Pixel users on the Android 16 QPR3 beta reported a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-cameras-are-shivering-after-the-latest-android-16-qpr3-beta">jittery camera issue</a>, while many Pixel 9 and Pixel 10 users have also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/that-infuriating-pixel-10-pixel-9-speakerphone-issue-wont-see-a-fix-anytime-soon-if-ever">complained about speakerphone problems</a>.</p><p>Now, another issue affecting some Google Pixel owners has surfaced, and this time it is stopping certain photos from being saved on the device.</p><p>Many users on Reddit have started reporting that pictures they took using their phones went "missing" and are not appearing in the Photos app (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-missing-photos-3627620/">Android Authority</a>). A user named <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1on6z0t/missing_photos_in_pixel/">Blazgamer initially reported</a> that their photos disappeared after receiving a notification saying that a few photos were being processed in the background.</p><p>Similarly, another user, portmafia9719, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1pts8yn/is_there_even_a_way_to_recover_my_photos_they_are/">reported</a> a related issue where their device got stuck in a backup and processing loop, after which some photos were gone and could not be found. The user reported that these missing files didn't show up in the gallery, trash, or anywhere else on the device, and instead seem to have gotten "lost" during processing.</p><h2 id="this-pixel-bug-can-cause-photos-to-vanish-entirely-2">This Pixel bug can cause photos to vanish entirely</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qsgmVmw78rNhCi8dvuastD" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-camera-viewfinder-01" alt="Using a Google Pixel 10 Pro XL to take a photo of a stone fish fountain" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qsgmVmw78rNhCi8dvuastD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Some users theorize that the issue occurs when you take a large number of photos in a very short period of time. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1pts8yn/comment/nvjzxyv/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">One explanation</a> suggests that when the camera app gets stuck and does not complete post-processing, it eventually clears everything from memory and fails to write the files to storage.</p><p>However, there is currently no way to verify this. The bug appears to be affecting not just one, but multiple Pixel models, ranging from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-vs-pixel-8">Pixel 8a</a> to the latest Pixel 10 Pro.</p><p>It isn't yet clear how widespread the issue is, but there are quite a few <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1p00tyz/if_processing_doesnt_disappear_after_taking_a/">reports on Reddit</a>, suggesting that at least a small portion of users may be affected. I personally have not faced this issue on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-vs-pixel-9-pro">Pixel 10 Pro</a> so far, but several users claim they have lost photos due to this bug.</p><p>We have reached out to Google for a comment on the issue. If more users continue to report this problem, the company may take action and release a fix. But for now, there is no fix for this issue out there. We will update this story if (and when) we hear back from Google.</p> ]]></dc:content>

With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-remix-images-google-messages">the new Remix feature in Google Messages</a>, users can find Nano Banana image editing and generation features right in their conversations. Although the feature is opt-in, Remix in Google Messages is publicly displayed throughout the app, complete with a banana emoji signifying Nano Banana.</p><p>After the Remix in Google Messages feature launched in November, it was not received well by Android fans, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1ouiguh/remix_makes_sending_photos_to_friends_even_more/" target="_blank">many criticizing Remix on Reddit</a>. By December 2025, Google responded to the criticism in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/messages/thread/392321302/update-on-messages-remix-feature-we-re-working-on-it" target="_blank">support post</a>.</p><p>"Thank you for sharing your feedback about the Remix feature in Messages. We hear you," wrote a Google community manager in the post. <br>Our team is actively working on improvements and refining the feature to make it smoother, more user-friendly, and enjoyable for everyone. Stay tuned for updates!"</p><p>Now, Google is toning down the look of Remix in version 20251212_00_RC01 of the Google Messages app beta, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/12/20/google-messages-nano-banana-remix/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>. After opening an image in full-screen view, the pill-shaped Remix button with a banana emoji is now completely removed. Instead, there's a general circle button for Remix that lives next to the reaction and comment buttons in Messages. This circular button has a sparkle emoji, instead of a banana emoji, to denote the AI-powered features.</p><a href="https://9to5google.com/2025/12/20/google-messages-nano-banana-remix/" target="_blank"><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1518px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:59.68%;"><img id="kwqe2MVPpdUna6pkmHVSuj" name="Google-Messages-Remix-Update-9to5Google" alt="The Remix button in the Google Messages app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kwqe2MVPpdUna6pkmHVSuj.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1518" height="906" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The old button for Remix in Google Messages (left) beside the new button (right), as reported by 9to5Google.  </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></a><p>Holding down an image in a Google Messages conversation still reveals a pill-shaped Remix icon, but it's smaller. Additionally, the banana emoji is replaced with an image icon featuring an AI sparkle. The Remix in Messages feature still works as expected, but the visual cues are less busy with the redesigned buttons.</p><p>It remains to be seen whether Google Messages users will appreciate the redesigned Remix interface. Critics of the feature complained that there is no way to disable Remix in Messages completely, and this visual change doesn't address that part of the issue. For now, Google Messages users will be saying goodbye to the Nano Banana emoji.</p> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Billboard is a staple of the music industry, and the publication has been tracking the top-selling albums each week since 1940. Of course, the way we consume music has undergone multiple significant changes since then. Most recently, music streaming has completely taken over the industry, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.riaa.com/growth-in-paid-subscription-streaming-drives-mid-year-2025-us-recorded-music-revenues-to-new-high-reports-riaa/" target="_blank">Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)</a> reporting streaming accounts for 84% of recorded music revenue in the U.S.</p><p>Since 2005, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube">YouTube</a> has been one of the biggest music streamers, especially for  music videos. The platform began contributing to Billboard's Hot 100 singles chart in 2013, and started influencing the Billboard Hot 200 albums chart in 2019. In other words, YouTube has impacted at least one Billboard chart for more than a decade, but that's all changing next month.</p><p>Starting on Jan. 16, 2026, YouTube will stop reporting streaming data to Billboard. YouTube streams will no longer influence Billboard's top singles or albums charts, which instantly changes how the most popular songs on YouTube perform on the leaderboards. Whether you're a casual YouTube streamer or a die-hard music love, this change is going to affect you one way or another.</p><h2 id="why-youtube-won-t-report-to-billboard-next-year-2">Why YouTube won't report to Billboard next year</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VgX6kso9EqHUMJuNkZZXm8" name="youtube-android-central" alt="Android Central's YouTube homepage" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VgX6kso9EqHUMJuNkZZXm8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sanuj Bhatia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In 2025, tracking the performance of albums and songs is a complicated effort. Music streams, album purchases, and everything in between need to be accounted for. Charts like Billboard use "album units" to gauge a song or album's relative success. One complete album sale equals an album unit, but multiple individual song purchases, paid song streams, or free and ad-supported song streams can add up to equal an album unit.</p><p>YouTube takes exception with that last part of Billboard's album unit calculation — free or ad-supported streams and paid streams aren't counted equally. If you stream a song on Spotify with a subscription, it'll be worth more than a free YouTube stream. Specifically, here's how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.billboard.com/pro/billboard-charts-add-more-weight-on-demand-streaming-2026/" target="_blank">Billboard</a> currently calculates an album unit for its charts:</p><div><blockquote><p>Currently, each album consumption unit equals one album sale, 10 individual tracks sold from an album, or 3,750 ad-supported or 1,250 paid/subscription on-demand official audio and video streams generated by songs from an album.</p><p>Billboard</p></blockquote></div><p>YouTube has had "extensive discussions" with Billboard about its calculations, according to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-billboard-chart-update/" target="_blank">blog post</a>. Billboard <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.billboard.com/pro/billboard-charts-add-more-weight-on-demand-streaming-2026/" target="_blank">announced</a> plans to add more weight to both paid and free streams earlier this month, which will take effect starting with Billboard charts dated Jan. 17, 2026. Thereafter, an album unit will equal 2,500 ad-supported streams or 1,000 paid or subscription on-demand streams.</p><p>"The change means that it will take 33.3% fewer ad-supported on-demand streams of songs from an album, and 20% fewer paid/subscription on-demand streams of songs from an album, to equal an album unit," according to Billboard.</p><p>So, while Billboard is narrowing the gap between paid and ad-supported streams starting next month, it hasn't met YouTube's demand. The Google-owned streaming platform wants full value parity between ad-supported and paid streams. Billboard isn't budging, at least for now, and thus YouTube is pulling its data from Billboard charts one day before the new streaming values take effect.</p><div><blockquote><p>Billboard uses an outdated formula that weights subscription-supported streams higher than ad-supported... We’re simply asking that every stream is counted fairly and equally, whether it is subscription-based or ad-supported—because every fan matters and every play should count.</p><p>YouTube</p></blockquote></div><p>In YouTube's blog post, authored by global head of music Lyor Cohen, the company also pointed out that YouTube's music streaming data includes a mix of paid and ad-supported streams. Some stream with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-premium">the ad-free YouTube Premium subscription plan</a>, while other stream with the ad-supported free version of YouTube.</p><p>A spokesperson for Billboard said in a statement that "there are so many ways a fan can support an artist they love, and each has a specific place in the music ecosystem."</p><p>"Billboard strives to measure that activity appropriately; balanced by various factors including consumer access, revenue analysis, data validation and industry guidance," the spokesperson for Billboard continued. "It is our hope that YouTube reconsiders and joins Billboard in recognizing the reach and popularity of artists on all music platforms and in celebrating their achievements through the power of fans and how they interact with the music that they love."</p><p>Right now, it appears that both YouTube and Billboard recognize their mutualistic relationship in the music streaming industry, and left the door open for YouTube data returning to the charts. However, neither Billboard nor YouTube sounds ready to concede on the hard stances they've taken on album unit consumption weighting.</p><h2 id="what-it-means-for-youtube-users-and-the-music-industry-2">What it means for YouTube users and the music industry</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Fm9BFBYs92bPuYnziBKnnk" name="Google-Pixel-8-Pro-youtube-app.jpg" alt="The YouTube app listing on the Google Play Store, running on a Google Pixel 8 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Fm9BFBYs92bPuYnziBKnnk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For users, there will be an impact to the way you consume music on YouTube, with the severity depending on how much you care about supporting your favorite artists. If you want your top songs or albums to help an artist climb the Billboard Hot 100 or Hot 200 charts, you probably shouldn't stream on YouTube after Jan. 16, 2025.</p><p>Additionally, if you follow Billboard charts, expect overall streaming numbers to diminish immediately following the change, as music videos get billions of streams on YouTube. With those streams soon to be no longer factored into Billboard charts, the number of album units calculated overall will almost certainly be lower than usual. Songs, albums, and artists that earn more streams on YouTube than other platforms may see a considerable charting hit compared to others.</p><p>There's also a wider industry concern that music releases on YouTube could be deprioritized by artists and publishers if they are not making an impact on the Billboard charts, which are crucial for gauging an album or song's success. This sentiment is shared by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/17/youtube-to-pull-music-data-from-billboards-charts-because-it-doesnt-like-its-ranking-formula/" target="_blank">TechCrunch</a>, and if this turns out to be the case, it could directly affect people who stream music via YouTube.</p><p>My take on YouTube's decision to pull out of Billboard charts is that with this move, everyone loses. Billboard's data becomes less accurate as it misses out data from a key platform that represents billions of streams. YouTube gives die-hard music fans less of a reason to stream on its platform, and potentially strains its relationship with artists and publishers. And users could see fewer songs uploaded to YouTube if publishers don't find the platform as attractive.</p><p>YouTube's hard stance on counting ad-supported and paid streams equally is the wrong one. It leaves no room for compromise and would require Billboard to rework its entire notion of an album unit's worth. Instead, the two companies should work together to find a middle ground, because everyone wins when YouTube contributes to Billboard charts.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The strings were spotted within the Media Router framework and include multiple references to Cast, suggesting Google is actively developing casting support for in-car Android experiences.</p><p>That said, the report notes that the strings are fairly generic, so it's possible Google is not directly adding <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/android-tv/apple-tv-android-app-adds-google-cast-support">Cast support to Android</a> Auto just yet. However, it would be odd for these references to appear in Android Auto if they were not meant to be used.</p><p>It's also worth noting that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-automotive-hands-on">Android Automotive</a> already supports Google Cast, which makes it logical for Google to extend similar functionality to Android Auto.</p><p>For those unfamiliar, Android Auto relies on your smartphone to project Android onto your car display, while Android Automotive runs natively on the vehicle and doesn't necessarily require a phone.</p><h2 id="google-is-testing-something-new-inside-android-auto-2">Google is testing something new inside Android Auto</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:62.50%;"><img id="aj5LdUw3mphxTPVYAKrCgf" name="android-auto-new-progress-bar" alt="New Material 3 Expressive progress bar in Android Auto" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aj5LdUw3mphxTPVYAKrCgf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1600" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google has previously teased video support for Android Auto, and this could be one of the features being worked on ahead of an official rollout.</p><p>Beyond Cast support, Android Auto 15.9 also appears to be adopting more of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-unveils-the-most-massive-android-redesign-ever">Material 3 Expressive</a> design language.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-auto-wavy-progress-bar-apk-teardown-3627067/">Android Authority</a>, the media player in the latest Android Auto build has begun transitioning to the updated design, including a new progress bar and refreshed button styles. The feature is not enabled by default, but the publication was able to manually activate it.</p><p>None of these features appear ready for public release yet, as Google is still actively working on them.

Foldables, smart glasses, and AI-driven wearables are set to redefine how we interact with technology, while memory shortages and slowing PC demand will create significant challenges for both brands and consumers. Here’s what to expect—and how to navigate it.</p><h2 id="foldables-finally-break-out-2">Foldables finally break out </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="gGiHtxSwFKFQMnbitUu9z" name="Pixel 10 Pro Fold" alt="Pixel 10 Pro Fold testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v2/t:0,l:0,cw:5184,ch:2916,q:80/gGiHtxSwFKFQMnbitUu9z.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>After years of incremental progress, foldables are poised for a breakout year. Apple’s entry into the category will be the defining moment, driving awareness and premium demand. IDC forecasts nearly 30% year-over-year growth for foldables in 2026, with Apple capturing roughly 22% of unit share and over a third of market value thanks to a price point near $2,400. This move will force Android vendors to double down on durability, crease reduction, and software optimization.</p><p>Samsung is already setting the tone with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-hands-on">Galaxy Z TriFold</a>, featuring a 10-inch inner display. The TriFold promises to blur the line between smartphone and tablet, creating new possibilities for multitasking and productivity.</p><h2 id="smart-glasses-enter-the-mainstream-2">Smart glasses enter the mainstream </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="a38SZoLvnDfpFWCi4BVsRk" name="meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-official-lifestyle-display-navigation" alt="An official image of Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses' display showing turn-by-turn navigation" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a38SZoLvnDfpFWCi4BVsRk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Smart glasses are finally moving beyond niche status. Meta has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/which-meta-smart-glasses-should-you-buy">expanded its Ray-Bans lineup</a> to include a display, while Google and Samsung prepare to launch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/my-demo-with-googles-ar-glasses-went-better-than-the-one-on-stage">Android XR </a>glasses in partnership with fashion brands like Warby Parker and Gentle Monster. Two types of glasses are expected: audio-first models for ambient AI experiences and display-in-lens designs for richer interactions.</p><p>Early demos have been promising, but both Google and Meta face critical challenges: ensuring their AI-powered assistance is reliable, fast, and privacy-conscious. If they succeed, smart glasses could become the next big wearable trend.</p><h2 id="wearables-get-helpful-not-noisy-2">Wearables get “helpful, not noisy” </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="owttN5qAUWQSMxnLyoQYWG" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-watch-ultra-2-hands-on-8" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 and Watch 8 Classic hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/owttN5qAUWQSMxnLyoQYWG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Wearables are evolving from notification hubs to health companions. Screen-free devices like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-review">Oura</a> and Whoop have captured consumer attention by focusing on deep biometrics such as sleep, recovery, and readiness. Expect more rings and bands that prioritize wellness insights over constant alerts, along with medical-adjacent features like ECG and blood pressure monitoring. Traditional smartwatches will lean harder into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">on-device AI</a> and safety features to justify their premium positioning.</p><h2 id="pc-growth-slows-2">PC growth slows </h2><p>Following a strong refresh cycle in 2025, PC growth is expected to cool in 2026. DIY builders face an especially challenging year as DRAM shortages drive up component costs. Windows on ARM products could also see a mild boost as second-generation products hit shelves, leading to further discounts on the prior generation. Plus, Nvidia is rumoured to launch a chip in late 2026, which should help the entire category.</p><h2 id="who-wins-in-2026-2">Who wins in 2026? </h2><p>Apple is well-positioned to dominate headlines and margins. Its foldable iPhone will validate the category and put pressure on Android vendors, while its tight control over hardware and supply chains will help it weather DRAM-related shocks better than most PC makers. A mainstream-priced Mac is expected to launch early in 2026, which will also put a lot of pressure on the Windows PC makers.</p><p>However, Samsung isn't far behind. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-trifold">Galaxy Z TriFold</a> will reinforce its leadership in foldables, and its smartphone strength and scale will continue, allowing the company to steal share from smaller Android smartphone players. The strength in smartphones often translates into wearable success since Samsung is great at bundling products, and with the upcoming XR glasses, Samsung is poised to play a major role in the smart glasses market.</p><p>When it comes to chipsets that will back these smartphones, Qualcomm remains the silent powerhouse. Its chips power nearly every premium Android flagship and dominate XR hardware. The upcoming Snapdragon X2 Elite will bring major CPU and GPU gains to PCs, along with an 80-TOPS NPU for AI workloads. Expect thin, sleek designs and perhaps even gaming-focused laptops built around this platform.</p><p>That said, Android XR looks promising, but Google still needs to prove it can deliver polished software and seamless Gemini integration at scale. Similarly, rumors of Android PCs persist, but Google’s track record in this space is weak. Even with Qualcomm’s hardware muscle, it’s unclear why consumers would choose Android over Windows or Mac.</p><h2 id="not-everyone-wins-2">Not everyone wins</h2><p>Consumers will feel the pinch as prices rise across categories. Memory shortages will lead to fewer upgrades at the same price points, smaller discounts on older models, and aggressive de-specing across devices. If you know you’ll need a phone or PC in 2026, buying early could save you money.</p><p>Smaller vendors face an even harsher reality. In tight supply cycles, memory suppliers prioritize top brands, leaving smaller and local players with little leverage. Some may exit the market entirely as BOM costs make devices unviable.</p><h2 id="how-to-navigate-2026-2">How to navigate 2026 </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vkQHj79sJVhEomysckUmgc" name="Huawei Mate X7" alt="Huawei Mate X7 hands-on testing in Dubai on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vkQHj79sJVhEomysckUmgc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you’re eyeing a foldable, consider waiting until Apple’s launch later in the year, as pricing and trade-in dynamics will shift. For memory-sensitive devices like smartphones and PCs, buy early to avoid <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/if-samsungs-dram-shortage-continues-your-next-galaxy-phone-will-take-a-hit">DRAM-driven price hikes</a>. If you travel frequently or multitask heavily, 2026 is the year to try smart glasses. And for wellness, pairing a screen-free wearable with a smartwatch offers the best balance of insights and convenience.</p><p>That is to say, 2026 will be a year of convergence under constraint. AI will become ambient across phones, glasses, wearables, and PCs, but supply shocks and rising costs will test both brands and buyers. Foldables and smart glasses will dominate headlines, PC growth will slow, and smaller vendors will fight for survival. For consumers, timing purchases strategically will matter more than ever.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Early 5-year forecasts were aggressive, with double-digit growth and fast bites into market share. However, the predictions tempered as shipments softened from the initial peaks, and the foldable market’s unit share never exceeded 1.6% of total smartphones.</p><p>As the year ends, foldables are expected to grow by just 10% YoY in 2025, as per IDC’s latest forecast, a growth lower than the record figures observed in the initial years of the technology. Still, the form factor refuses to stay down, and the tide is turning in favor of foldables.</p><p>Although the first foldable phones launched with book-style designs, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip models</a> quickly became the dominant form factor — driven by their lower price points and, perhaps, the nostalgia of flip feature phones. It wasn’t until 2025 that fold models captured the lead with 53% of market share in the category.</p><p>Android brands, led by Samsung, Honor, Oppo, and Google, leveraged their latest foldable models, determined to challenge the $1,000+ premium segment long dominated by Apple, which lacked a foldable offering.</p><h2 id="how-new-engineering-just-eliminated-the-foldables-biggest-flaw-2">How new engineering just eliminated the foldables’ biggest flaw</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5060px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="7ctSG2tqh3hWMzAVmcHWg" name="Pixel 10 Pro Fold" alt="Pixel 10 Pro Fold testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7ctSG2tqh3hWMzAVmcHWg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5060" height="2850" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>At the same time, incremental breakthroughs in design and durability began redefining the innovation game, giving foldables a stronger edge. For example, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-vs-honor-magic-v5" target="_blank">the Honor Magic V5 </a>is the thinnest foldable on the market, with a folded thickness of 8.8mm and an unfolded thickness of 4.1mm.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-camera-comparison">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> measures 8.9mm when folded and 4.2mm when unfolded.

Even if compared to a non-foldable in Galaxy line-up, it beats Samsung’s thinnest S25 Edge in its unfolded form.</p><p>In terms of durability, the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-early-battery-impressions"> Galaxy Z Fold 7 promises to withstand up to 500,000 folds</a> thanks to enhanced materials and a hinge design, while the Galaxy Z Fold 6 could only handle 200,000 folds. This means a 10-year durability for an average user for the latest version.</p><p>These comparisons show that the consumers’ biggest concern — bulkiness — is no longer a limiting factor.

It is the first trifold phone powered by Android and backed by Samsung, the leading name in the foldable category. With its global reach and strong brand power, Samsung is positioned to bring trifold technology to mainstream users faster than Huawei.</p><p>Lacking Android and Google services, Huawei faces entry barriers in markets outside China and, hence, targets China primarily with its Mate XT and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-vs-huawei-mate-xts">Mate XTs</a> trifolds. Despite this setback, together, both models captured a 3.6% unit share of the foldable market in the first three quarters of 2025, while selling over 740,000 units and generating a massive $2B in revenue since their launch. These shares and figures are incredible, given that both models are priced and sold at a hefty $2,500.</p><h2 id="the-2026-turning-point-what-happens-when-apple-finally-enters-the-arena-2">The 2026 turning point: What happens when Apple finally enters the arena?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HmPVR9kvVmKqtX9Lj4zTqf" name="iphone-air-fold-mock-render" alt="Mockup of iPhone Fold based on iPhone Air" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HmPVR9kvVmKqtX9Lj4zTqf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As trifold foldables captivate consumers, the real turning point looms in 2026: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/the-iphone-air-doesnt-matter-its-just-a-test">Apple finally steps into the foldable arena</a>, forecasted to gain a 22% unit share and 34% value share of the foldables market in its first year, according to IDC.</p><p>Apple’s ability to sell on a scale to a loyal customer base will certainly translate into healthier growth for the entire foldable space.

Along with that, it changed how it handles Android updates, with a major build going out in the summer and a minor release in the winter.</p><p>Combine that with a major UI overhaul, even tighter AI integration into its products, and Google had a busy year.</p><p>Overall, there's much greater enthusiasm around what Google has to share with the broader Android ecosystem in 2026. With Android XR headsets debuting, the integration of ChromeOS with Android, and all the new features Google is baking into Android, it's going to be an exciting year.</p><p>I made a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/an-android-os-preview-five-key-trends-we-expect-in-2025">set of predictions around Android OS</a> last year, and it's time to see how they held up.</p><h2 id="regular-updates-c-2">Regular updates: C</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8nqK6fPrM96zAcwqTTxE8X" name="Android 16" alt="Android 16 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8nqK6fPrM96zAcwqTTxE8X.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Look, Google does a great job rolling out regular software updates to Pixels, and it's great to see so many feature-filled updates hitting even older devices. I don't have any issues with that, and obviously, Android platform releases also go out to Google's devices the moment they're available.</p><p>My issue is with the broader Android ecosystem. Most brands still do a pathetic job with software updates (looking at you, Xiaomi and Motorola), and Google needs to step in and set the terms a little better in these situations. As it stands, there's just no reason for most phone manufacturers to bother with updates, and I want to see that change.</p><p>I'll admit this is getting better with flagships; most brands now deliver updates within a few months of the stable build, and most high-end phones will get at least four platform updates (unless you're using an ASUS phone). But with phone hardware getting much better over the last 18 months, these devices are designed to last the better part of a decade, and the software is more often than not the limiting factor.</p><h2 id="ui-tweaks-a-2">UI tweaks: A</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5009px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="NAbPcBeMTYdT2xqHJr9kFA" name="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL photos on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NAbPcBeMTYdT2xqHJr9kFA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5009" height="2821" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I like what Google is doing with the Pixel's UI. While <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-unveils-the-most-massive-android-redesign-ever">Material 3 Expressive</a> may not be to everyone's liking, I enjoy the interface's design, and I can't get enough of how playful and vibrant it is. As someone who tests a <em>lot</em> of Android phones, there's no consistency or originality when it comes to most interfaces, with most Chinese brands now emulating the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-material-3-expressive-vs-ios-26-liquid-glass">Liquid Glass design of iOS 26</a>.</p><p>In that context, it's great to see Google have a solid vision for the software and deliver it coherently. I would like the interface to make its way to other Android brands, but I know that's just wishful thinking; after talking to most phone brands, it's clear that they have their own ideology when it comes to the UI.</p><h2 id="ai-everywhere-b-2">AI everywhere: B</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wWeFPGNm5zJHAVajEvLwjG" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-magic-cue-google-messages" alt="A Magic Cue calendar chip in Google Messages on a Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wWeFPGNm5zJHAVajEvLwjG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Most phone brands have AI-assisted features just because it is the buzzword de jour.

Real-time call translate works really well, and it does an eerily good job at mimicking your voice.</p><p>The features I use the most are around image editing; the Pixel holds up pretty well in this area, and utilities like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-add-me-google-pixel-9">Add Me</a> are genuinely great. If there's one criticism, it's that Google doesn't organize these features; you'll stumble upon most of these as you use the phone. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Samsung organizes all its AI features</a> in the phone settings, so you can easily see what's available — Google needs to do something similar.</p><h2 id="android-and-chromeos-integration-c-2">Android and ChromeOS integration: C</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="5egdsQZmNDt5eQJRw2uEGa" name="lenovo-chromebook-duet-3-update-page-chromeos-120-beta.jpg" alt="ChromeOS 120 on Lenovo Chromebook Duet 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5egdsQZmNDt5eQJRw2uEGa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google is taking its sweet time merging ChromeOS into Android, and although the brand talked about the upcoming integration, we haven't really heard much about it.

Google did this to an extent with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> and Android 16 by integrating foldable-focused features, and having an actual desktop OS built in is going to be exciting.

The company previously said it would unveil "new AI-driven customer experiences," and as the event approaches, it is becoming clear what one of those innovations will be: Gemini integration in a refrigerator.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-to-unveil-ai-vision-built-with-google-gemini-at-ces-2026">new blog post</a>, Samsung announced it will showcase its latest kitchen appliance lineup at CES 2026. Among them is the new Bespoke AI Refrigerator Family Hub, which will feature upgraded AI Vision capabilities and Gemini for the first time.</p><h2 id="gemini-is-now-coming-to-your-fridge-for-better-or-worse-2">Gemini is now coming to your fridge, for better or worse</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f0_IQ5vQJJk" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Samsung says its previous smart refrigerators could recognize up to 37 types of fresh food and 50 types of pre-registered processed food on device. With Gemini built into the fridge, the company claims it will be able to recognize an even wider range of food items.</p><p>Samsung adds that the new Bespoke AI Refrigerator Family Hub will also recognize processed foods without separate registration, detect user-labeled items, and add foods stored in personal containers directly to the food list.</p><p>Alongside the AI refrigerator, Samsung is also planning to showcase a new Bespoke AI Wine Cellar with integrated Gemini. According to the company, when users store or remove wine bottles, a camera positioned at the top of the unit will recognize labels and track and update the SmartThings AI Wine Manager in real-time.</p><p>The system will also be able to differentiate between specific shelves and compartments where each bottle is placed, making it easier to check locations without searching manually.

There is a constant onslaught of new releases, software updates, and industry changes that are shifting and evolving. While the market for Chromebooks and tablets isn't as volatile as smartphones or wearables, 2025 surprised me in a few ways.</p><p>I guess that's to say that I'm thankful that I'm able to look back and review <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/looking-at-the-chromebook-and-tablet-markets-in-2025">what my thoughts were</a> at this time last year. Both Chromebooks and tablets were in a completely different place than they are today, and as 2025 comes to a close, it's time to reflect on how things played out over the past 12 months.</p><h2 id="a-rollercoaster-of-a-year-for-chromebooks-and-chromeos-2">A rollercoaster of a year for Chromebooks and ChromeOS</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5077px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RhNKmxQWajtiPx3YBM8dxc" name="android-rewind-home-page-on-chromebook" alt="Android Rewind on Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RhNKmxQWajtiPx3YBM8dxc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5077" height="2856" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For much of the year, things were fairly quiet with Chromebooks. Really, the first half of the year was more "ho-hum" than I expected, with new Chromebook releases being quite iterative. It wasn't entirely unexpected, as Samsung and Lenovo ended 2024 with a bang thanks to the former's return to the platform after a hiatus, and the latter bringing us another great hybrid option.</p><p>Fundamentally, there weren't many drastic changes made to ChromeOS, as Google shifted its focus to better implementing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> into the system. Little did I know that bigger plans were on the horizon for both the hardware and the software.</p><h2 id="flagship-arm-chips-bring-x86-power-without-sacrificing-battery-life-2">Flagship ARM chips bring x86 power without sacrificing battery life</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="j2J7TyN7RUhn9VL5fHMT9o" name="lenovo-chromebook-plus-14-hands-on-mediatek-kompanio-ultra-sticker" alt="MediaTek Kompanio Ultra logo on Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/j2J7TyN7RUhn9VL5fHMT9o.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The major shift didn't really begin until the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/lenovo-chromebook-plus-14-hands-on">Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14</a> was revealed in June, offering the "dream" Chromebook with excellent performance and incredible battery life. Lenovo certainly delivered, thanks to the MediaTek Kompanio Ultra 910, an ARM chip that goes toe-to-toe with some of the best traditional x86 chips found in Chromebooks.</p><p>Not only does this make for a very snappy Chromebook, but the Kompanio Ultra allowed Google to implement even more on-device Gemini functionality. Up to this point, a few AI tasks could be handled locally, but many still relied on cloud processing, potentially slowing your workflow. That's now changed, as you're now able to perform tasks like editing images with Gemini on your Chromebook.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="DmDoGvHo4WipPbR3c7TJin" name="lenovo-chromebook-plus-14-hands-on-18" alt="Smart Grouping showcase during Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 event" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DmDoGvHo4WipPbR3c7TJin.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It wouldn't be until September that we would see the Kompanio Ultra arrive in another option, as Acer picked up the mantle with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/acer-makes-a-splash-at-ifa-2025-with-the-chromebook-plus-spin-514-and-new-chromeboxes">Chromebook Plus Spin 514</a>. It offers the same level of performance as Lenovo's Chromebook, but has the benefit of sporting a convertible design, whereas the Lenovo sticks to a traditional laptop design.</p><p>Just as impressive, if not more so, is the battery life for these new Chromebooks. Both the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 and Acer Chromebook Plus Spin 514 are rated to last for up to 17 hours on a single charge. This is a far cry from the 8-10 hours we're used to seeing on many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">best Chromebooks</a> that rely on x86 processors.</p><h2 id="it-s-not-all-sunshine-and-rainbows-in-the-chromebook-world-2">It's not all sunshine and rainbows in the Chromebook world</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vJioWTjQPFy3DjMMzGk8tZ" name="samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review-27.jpg" alt="microSD card sticking out of the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vJioWTjQPFy3DjMMzGk8tZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While it was awesome to see the Kompanio Ultra set a new standard for what Chromebooks should be capable of, only two OEMs are bringing these to the masses. Samsung seems to be just letting the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review" target="_blank">Galaxy Chromebook Plus</a> ride the wave for a while, while ASUS and HP have pushed more iterative releases.</p><p>Honestly, that's not really a big deal, as it's still nice to have a bit of competition in the space, regardless of the price range. However, I was frustrated by OEMs' unwillingness to release Chromebooks with higher storage configurations. Some have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-micro-sd-card-android">microSD card slots</a>, which is great (in theory), but not always reliable.</p><p>I hoped we'd see at least one Chromebook with 1TB of storage, but we didn't even get one with 512GB. Well, at least not one released for consumers and not limited to businesses.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="qfhgRE4cbo6gDd98HUwdMd" name="google-gemini-claude-chatgpt-samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-google-pixel-9-pro-fold" alt="Gemini 2.5 Pro on the Galaxy Chromebook Plus, ChatGPT on the Galaxy Z Fold 6, Claude on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qfhgRE4cbo6gDd98HUwdMd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This could become a problem rather quickly. One concern is that as Chromebooks become more powerful, it opens the door to more on-device Gemini and AI functionality.</p><p>However, to perform tasks on-device, the necessary AI models must be accessible locally, so they must be downloaded. So it's not entirely inconceivable that your brand-new 128GB Chromebook really only has around 100GB of usable space, which simply isn't enough for a daily computing device.</p><p>The other problem is that a memory shortage is already driving up the prices of RAM and storage. Just as a brief example, take the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09X7MPX8L">SanDisk Extreme 1TB microSD card</a>. For much of the past year, it's hovered around the $100 mark, reaching a low of about $76 back in October.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:855px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="4VBPeDJoMUkfPeTQu8bukX" name="sandisk-extreme-2tb-microsd-pricing-camelcamelcamel" alt="Amazon pricing of the SanDisk Extreme 2TB microSD card over the past six months" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4VBPeDJoMUkfPeTQu8bukX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="855" height="481" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: CamelCamelCamel)</span></figcaption></figure><p>However, over the past two months, the price creep has led the microSD card to be priced at $140.

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Libraries are still an excellent resource for physical media, whether it be books, audio CDs, DVDs, or other content types. One thing libraries still haven't figured out how to consistently make available to communities at large is digital content. There are plenty of digital libraries available online, but concerns about piracy and proper compensation for media rights holders make the experience complicated. It's a problem Anna's Archive, self-described as "the largest truly open library in human history," is trying to solve.</p><p>In an absolutely stunning twist, Anna's Archive announced it backed up almost all of the music available on Spotify. The Dec. 20 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://annas-archive.org/blog/backing-up-spotify.html" target="_blank">blog post</a> reveals Anna's Archive "discovered a way to scrape Spotify at scale," and the team "saw a role for us here to build a music archive primarily aimed at preservation." The data backup contains 86 million music files, which Anna's Archive says represents 99.6% of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify">Spotify</a> listens.</p><p>Anna's Archive began in 2022 as a torrent aggregator and search engine for primarily text-based files stored across LibGen, Sci-Hub, Z-Lib, and other torrents. It emerged in response to U.S. government efforts to shut down Z-Library. The group, made up on anonymous contributors, now wants to create something similar for music.</p><p>Understandably, Spotify isn't happy with the reports of Anna's Archive scraping its music files, with the company calling out the use of "illicit tactics" to bypass <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-drm-android-apps">DRM</a> and copyright protections. A ton of questions remain, like whether Spotify or regulators will attempt to take legal actions against Anna's Archive, or if a "free" database of Spotify songs will be made available for the average listener.</p><p>The massive music backup, unlike anything we've ever seen before, is going to force companies, regulators, and users to answer the following question: what separates preservation from piracy?</p><h2 id="what-anna-s-archive-managed-to-back-up-2">What Anna's Archive managed to back up</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4072px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.34%;"><img id="t9wAivbKyuqhceHsoKZMfB" name="Spotify" alt="Spotify icon on Find X9 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/t9wAivbKyuqhceHsoKZMfB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4072" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Anna's Archive said it chose to back up Spotify tracks based on the company's own popularity metric. There are a ton of songs on Spotify that get virtually zero listens. For perspective, the archive estimates the top three songs on Spotify were streamed more than the bottom 20 to 100 million songs combined. In all, the backup includes metadata from 256 million tracks and audio files for 86 million songs.</p><p>Spotify defines its popularity metric as "a value between 0 and 100, with 100 being the most popular." It's calculated by an algorithm that's "based, in the most part, on the total number of plays the track has had and how recent those plays are."</p><p>Using this categorization, Anna's Archive backed up the 86 million most-popular songs, which accounts for 37% of Spotify's entire catalog. However, it also makes up 99.6% of listens. In other words, while the archive backed up less than half of Spotify songs, it covers almost all of the tracks people actually listen to.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="SxVePJthiStuJ4aLAuMiuT" name="Annas-Archive-Spotify-Archive" alt="The popularity distribution for music files archived by Anna's Archive from Spotify." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SxVePJthiStuJ4aLAuMiuT.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3200" height="2400" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Anna's Archive)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While Anna's Archive backed up Spotify metadata for 99.9% of tracks, making it the largest music metadata archive in the world, it stopped at only 37% of Spotify music files due to storage constraints. The 86 million archived songs represent 300TB of storage, and the rest would've required 700TB of additional storage "for minor benefit," according to the blog post.</p><p>The music files are formatted in OGG Vorbis at 160kbps for songs with a popularity metric greater than zero. Songs with a popularity of zero were re-encoded in OGG Vorbis at 75kbps. Anna's Archive added metadata to the audio files, including "including title, url, ISRC, UPC, album art, and replaygain information." Audio files typically contain no metadata of their own, so this is significant.</p><h2 id="spotify-says-this-is-just-scraping-using-illicit-tactics-2">Spotify says this is just scraping using 'illicit tactics'</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5095px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="G5PpFQXAKCzqifgyUbWDpB" name="Spotify" alt="Spotify Premium Platinum plan details in India" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/G5PpFQXAKCzqifgyUbWDpB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5095" height="2870" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We have to point out that Anna's Archive backup is illegal for a variety of reasons. The scraping of Spotify's databases violate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/read-the-fine-print">the company's terms of service</a>, and the removal of digital rights management (DRM) features and sharing of copyrighted material both violate copyright law. By definition, the Anna's Archive music backup is piracy.</p><p>Spotify seems to agree, as it made statements to both <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/spotify-annas-archive-3627023/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/worlds-largest-shadow-library-brags-it-scraped-300tb-of-spotify-music-metadata/" target="_blank">Ars Technica</a> commenting on the Anna's Archive release.</p><p>"An investigation into unauthorized access identified that a third party scraped public metadata and used illicit tactics to circumvent DRM to access some of the platform’s audio files," Spotify told Android Authority. "We are actively investigating the incident."</p><p>Notably, Spotify doesn't confirm the scope of the Anna's Archive backup, only saying that "some" of the site's audio files were accessed. In a separate statement, Spotify said it is taking action to prevent something like this from happening again.</p><p>"We've implemented new safeguards for these types of anti-copyright attacks and are actively monitoring for suspicious behavior," a Spotify spokesperson told Ars Technica. "Since day one, we have stood with the artist community against piracy, and we are actively working with our industry partners to protect creators and defend their rights."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XDtnK264C4iAnNGKy7pd2S" name="spotify-pixel-4xl-lifestyle.jpeg" alt="Spotify on the Pixel 4 XL." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XDtnK264C4iAnNGKy7pd2S.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While Anna's Archive cites altruistic motivations as their reasons for trying to "preserve" Spotify's music catalog, there are major concerns for artists, record labels, and streaming services. The backup could create ways for listeners to stream music without paying for it, hurting the music industry. As it is currently released, it would be difficult for the average listener to find or stream individual songs within the 300TB backup, but that could change.</p><p>"For now this is a torrents-only archive aimed at preservation, but if there is enough interest, we could add downloading of individual files to Anna’s Archive," the archive's blog post notes. "Please let us know if you’d like this."</p><p>It's currently unclear what, if any, legal action could be taken against Anna's Archive as a result of this move. Theoretically, the archive's decentralized network structure prevents it from being shuttered completely. However, when it comes to music, there's a lot of money on the line — giving rights holders and regulators incentive to protect copyrighted material.</p><p>In September 2025, the Internet Archive settled a lawsuit claiming it served as an "illegal record store" for 4,000 songs (via Reuters). As a reminder, Anna's Archive just backed up 86 million.</p><h2 id="is-this-preservation-or-piracy-2">Is this preservation or piracy? </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1999px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="N8YDEEixyqyFevodQ3Ni8L" name="Spotify-hero-android.jpg" alt="Spotify logo on an Android phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N8YDEEixyqyFevodQ3Ni8L.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1999" height="1124" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As a music enjoyer and someone who closely follows the industry, I see both sides here. There is a valid argument to be made for the need to preserve digital media.</p><p>On a high level, songs can quickly become "lost media" without preservation — lost media is usually defined as "any type of media thought to no longer exist in any format, or for which no copies can be located, partial or otherwise." The idea of music becoming lost media is terrifying, and if archival can prevent that from happening, a preservation angle starts to make sense.</p><p>Just this month, Taylor Swift replaced the original versions of two songs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/taylor-swift-reputation-lyric-changes-explained-1235483070/" target="_blank">with new recordings with altered lyrics</a>. Without physical media or digital archives, those original recordings could disappear forever.</p><p>Another reason I buy the altruistic goal of the Anna's Archive backup is the quality of the songs scraped. At 160kbps, the highest-quality songs are very low-quality, making them less appealing to listeners. These music files are lower-quality than 256kbps AAC and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/tech-talk-what-is-lossless-audio">far worse than any lossless format</a>. The archive could've backed up fewer songs at higher quality, but it didn't, which tells me this really was about preservation.</p><p>Here's the problem: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/you-shouldnt-steal-ebooks-unless-you-have-good-lawyers">from a legal perspective, it doesn't matter</a>. This is piracy according to U.S. copyright law. I can't tell you whether Anna's Archive is correct on a moral or ethical basis, but I can tell you its actions are illegal. And if the songs stripped from Spotify are made easily available for consumers as an alternative to paying for music, it could do irreparable harm to the music industry.</p><p>Android Central does not condone the sharing or distribution of copyrighted material.
