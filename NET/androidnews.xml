According to the lawsuit (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251124006331/en/Lieff-Cabraser-and-Kaplan-Gore-Announce-Filing-of-Federal-Class-Action-Lawsuit-Against-Google-Over-the-Defective-Google-Nest-Hub-Google-Nest-Hub-Max-Google-Nest-Mini-and-Google-Nest-Audio-Devices">Business Wire</a>), both sides state that the Google Nest Hub, Google Nest Hub Max, Google Nest Mini, and Google Nest Audio have become faulty and have otherwise "malfunctioned" over the years.</p><p>The lawsuit lists a few issues, such as the aforementioned devices no longer "respond to even basic verbal questions." Not only has the Q&A portion of these Nest devices failed over time, but the plaintiffs state "widespread complaints" have been reported from consumers regarding failure to "interpret or act on voice commands, returning irrelevant information, losing internet connectivity despite a stable WiFi connection, and failing to recognize registered user voices."</p><p>The plaintiffs are calling this a "consumer case," one that aims to receive some sort of compensation for those who purchase these devices that have deteriorated drastically.</p><p>The report explains that user reports indicate that those who've purchased these devices have been forced to stop using them, since their main/primary function no longer works. The lawsuit argues that Google's unwillingness to fix these devices has caused consumers to spend "hundreds and sometimes thousands of dollars."</p><p>The Business Wire post cites Darren Kaplan from Kaplan Gore, who states, "However, rather than getting 'smarter' and better over time, these Google ‘smart’ home devices get worse at their core function of analyzing and processing voice commands."</p><h2 id="we-can-follow-this-trail-2">We can follow this trail...</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:799px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="6PPzUy8PbD5uuYLFtzz2nL" name="Google-Nest-Hub-Max-lifestyle-3.jpg" alt="Google Nest Hub Max" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6PPzUy8PbD5uuYLFtzz2nL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="799" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The lawsuit also states that Google has been aware of these problems, considering users took to X (formerly Twitter) to voice their complaints. The company responded in kind; however, nothing worthwhile has come of that.</p><p>This federal lawsuit is quite timely, considering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/google-resolves-issue-causing-nest-speakers-displays-to-fail-answering-basic-requests">Google's been struggling</a> with its Nest devices since January. Reports from the start of 2025 highlighted problems with voice commands, like "What's the weather," as mentioned in the lawsuit. Speakers and displays were involved in this (just like the lawsuit mentions), but Google stated a fix was rolling out, as user reports flooded all channels.</p><p>However, that wasn't the end of it. Jumping to July, and we <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/google-finally-heard-your-nest-and-assistant-frustrations-promises-a-fix">still heard reports</a> of users grappling with unaware and unattentive Nest devices. Users were so incredibly frustrated and raised their voices loud enough that Google's head of Home and Nest went on social media to personally speak with them. At the time, Google "promised" a fix, but there was the impression that a solution wasn't going to arrive until the fall.</p><p>Given the fact that this class action lawsuit has been served, it doesn't look like things have gone according to the original plan.</p> ]]></dc:content>

I've been using them as my primary earbuds for more than a year, and at this price, they're easily one of the best buys you can make this holiday season.</p><p>Right now, Amazon is offering the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FGKMZBZC/"><strong>Pixel Buds Pro 2 for just $134</strong></a>, which is about 40% off their original $229 price.

Having used them for over a year, they're the only pair I carry thanks to their lightweight and compact build that doesn't protrude much from the ears.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="f6356178-8f29-4e5f-a503-6e60fd6cf221" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="At $95 off, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 is a no-brainer for anyone looking for a new pair of earbuds.

In addition to this, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 also offer excellent ANC and a comfortable fit for long listening sessions.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you use an iPhone as your primary device or require constant multipoint Bluetooth switching between non-Google devices.</p><p>The twist-to-fit design ensures the Pixel Buds Pro 2 stay in place even during intense workouts or runs. The ANC on the Pixel Buds Pro 2 is also one of the best I've used. It's not quite <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/airpods-pro-3-review">AirPods Pro 3-level</a>, which practically silences everything around you, but it's definitely better than most options you can get in this price range.</p><p>Plus, if you use Gemini frequently, these earbuds support Gemini Live out of the box, meaning you can have a live conversation with Gemini directly through your earbuds. One of my absolute favorite features is Conversation Detection, which automatically reduces the volume whenever you're speaking so you don't have to remove an earbud to talk to someone.</p><p>If you own a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/best-google-pixel-phones">Pixel phone</a>, you'll enjoy the tight integration since these earbuds appear directly in Bluetooth settings, where you can adjust touch controls, ANC modes, and firmware updates. They work just as well with other Android phones from OnePlus, Samsung, or Motorola, too. You'll simply need to download the Pixel Buds app from the Play Store during setup.</p><p>If I had to nitpick, it'd be that these earbuds don't play perfectly with an iPhone. While most Google services work on iOS, Google hasn't made a Pixel Buds Pro 2 app for iPhone. You can still pair and use them, but there's no dedicated app to control features.</p><p>That said, at this price, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-review">Pixel Buds Pro 2</a> feel like an absolute steal.

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Samsung has a stranglehold in North America, and that's largely down to the manufacturer cozying up with phone carriers a decade and a half ago. The result is that the brand utterly dominates sales, to the extent that it is seen as the default Android choice when mulling a new purchase.</p><p>This has led to Samsung coasting in recent years, rolling out what is basically the same phone year over year. Thankfully, other manufacturers do things differently, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/one-year-with-the-oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a> in particular has been a real standout this year. The phone has a stunning design, monstrous internals, battery life that will make every Samsung user envious, cameras that hold their own against the Galaxy S25 Ultra, and a better AMOLED panel.</p><p>In short, the OnePlus 13 is a much better phone than anything Samsung has to offer at the moment, and the best part is that because it's been out for the better part of a year, it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Smartphone-Snapdragon-SUPERVOOC-Hasselblad/dp/B0DP8KZLQ3?th=1">discounted to $699 right now</a>. Without overstating things, this is the best phone you can get for this amount, and nothing else outshines it — even the newer OnePlus 15. Why should you trust me? I test nearly a hundred devices over the course of any given year, and I used all mainstream phones released in 2025.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="dcb744de-3e5e-4396-a44e-7db2a32cb0e1" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="At $699, there really isn't any other device that gives you the same caliber of hardware.

The OnePlus 13 has excellent fluidity, amazing internals, standout battery life, and great cameras.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You don't want a good phone, and want to continue using whatever Samsung comes out with every year.</p><p>Even after nearly a year of availability, the OnePlus 13 is a terrific phone. The hardware has no signs of slowing down whatsoever, and it continues to be incredibly fluid in regular use — both at mundane tasks as well as gaming.</p><p>The design has aged well too; the unique leather texture is great to hold and use, and I like that it isn't as grainy as usual leather, instead featuring a softer finish. The in-hand feel is excellent, and even though it has a 6,000mAh battery, it isn't that heavy.</p><p>On that note, battery life is excellent, and I still get a day's worth of use. The AMOLED panel is among the brightest, and you get a level of fluidity that you just don't see on most devices today. It doesn't miss out on any of the extras either, and you get a charger in the box.</p><p>Best of all, the cameras are fantastic; the Hasselblad tuning makes a real difference, leading to photos with great dynamic range and color vibrancy. If anything, I like the OnePlus 13 to the OnePlus 15, and it's much better than the Galaxy S25 Ultra and every other Samsung phone. So if you've been a long-time Samsung user and want something better, you should <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Smartphone-Snapdragon-SUPERVOOC-Hasselblad/dp/B0DP8KZLQ3">get the OnePlus 13 while it's still at $699</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The 5,000mAh model in particular conveys this well; at just 7.6mm, it is thinner than your phone, and it attaches magnetically without any issues. In fact, I only use the 10,000mAh model as I need a bigger battery — otherwise, I would have used the 5,000mAh power bank all the time.</p><p>Also, the 10,000mAh model gets Qi 2 integration, so if you have a phone like the iPhone 17 or the Pixel 10, this is the ideal power bank to use with those devices. Both power banks get a USB-C charging port to connect to a phone the old-fashioned way, and they deliver fast charging too — the 5,000mAh model does 20W over USB-C, and the 10,000mAh model hits 27W.</p><p>You get 15W charging when used in the default magnetic configuration, and I found that to be adequate in daily use. It's just convenient to just have the power bank connected to the phone and charge it, and the metal design is built to last — I've used both power banks extensively in the last six months, and there have been no problems whatsoever. So if you need a new power bank, I'd recommend getting the Qi 2 10,000mAh Picogo — it's a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Baseus-Portable-Certified-Wireless-10000mAh/dp/B0DY7J8HPQ">fantastic deal at $36</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

I used Hue, Xiaomi, Yeelight, Nanoleaf, and just about every other smart lighting brand (most of which you've never heard of) in the last decade, and when Govee came along, it was a revelation.</p><p>I have over 30 Govee products in the house, and they're all terrific. To say that I like the brand's products would be an understatement, and in over three years of use, I haven't had any issues with the brand, which is something I can't say for any other smart home brand.</p><p>To get to the point, Govee excels at outdoor lights, and the Permanent Outdoor Lights 2 are among its best. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Permanent-Waterproof-Halloween-Assistant/dp/B0D14WP9TB">100-feet model is now down to $199</a>, down from its usual retail price of $329, making it a standout deal if you're looking to set up holiday lights.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="b25170a9-b343-41dd-9c4a-0473b1c9cd96" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="There's no doubt that Govee does the best outdoor lights, to the point where other brands (hello, Hue) are now emulating what it's doing just to get in on the action.

Honestly, Govee is the best at this, and its outdoor lights have a level of customization that you just don't get with any other brand.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You want even more LEDs (I don't blame you). If that's the case, you should consider the brand-new Prism Outdoor Lights, which are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FGCZCQMR">also discounted heavily right now</a>.</p><p>I used the Permanent Outdoor Lights 2 when they launched, and they're terrific to use. They don't take much effort to install, and you get high-quality LEDs with good brightness and color vibrancy, and the Govee mobile app is a slam dunk — it just has so much customization that you won't end up using all the features.</p><p>There isn't much else to talk about. The lights are housed in an IP67 water-resistant shell, and they held up without any issues in India's monsoon, so you should have no problems whatsoever in this area. Also, it's evident that these lights are a big hit; Govee sells a metric ton of these, and while the brand wouldn't give me sales numbers, it indicated that it created a new division solely focused on outdoor lights, so it's clearly dominating in this category.</p><p>I'll admit that the latest Prism Outdoor Lights are even better as they have a trio of LEDs within each light, but they're costly — even with the discount, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FGCZCQMR">they're at $399</a>, or double the price of the Outdoor Light 2. If you don't need the absolute latest, the Outdoor Lights 2 will serve you very well, and at $199, there really is no reason not to buy these lights ahead of the holidays.</p> ]]></dc:content>

No. But it's always nice to have a headset that tunes out the jet engine whine, the rattle of the drinks cart, and all the annoying sounds you have to put up with while traveling. The QuietComfort Ultra has a lightweight design, and it doesn't exert any pressure whatsoever, making it highly comfortable to wear.</p><p>The sound quality is terrific, but that's always been the case with Bose products. The QC Ultra has a neutral sound that allows instruments and vocals to shine, and you still get engaging bass that's full of vibrancy. The noise isolation is among the best of any headset, and I honestly just use the headset without even playing any music at times while on a flight.</p><p>There isn't much different with the QC Ultra Gen 2, and that's how you know its predecessor is truly noteworthy. Bose didn't change the design or sound tuning, instead adding USB-C audio — a nice-to-have feature — and increasing the battery life to 30 hours. Now, the QC Ultra is decent enough in its own right, lasting 24 hours on a full charge, but having that little bit extra makes a difference on intercontinental flights — as I found out on a recent visit to Mexico from India.</p><p>Now, having used both headsets extensively this year, I'd suggest just getting the QuietComfort Ultra; it's a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Wireless-Cancelling-Headphones/dp/B0CCZ1L489">much better deal at $298</a>, and you're not really missing out on much. If you need the absolute latest from Bose, the QC Ultra 2 is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Cancelling/dp/B0FDKR293G">obvious choice at $399</a>. With that done, I'm going to return to my in-flight movie.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It is just as easy to take on the road as other portable Bluetooth speakers, and it doesn't weight that much. The distinctive styling gives it an advantage, and yes, I know that the design by itself doesn't mean much, but I like the way the Emberton III looks quite a bit, and it's one of the reasons why I use it.</p><p>Then there's the sound; I use the Kilburn II and Stanmore in my house, and while I didn't think the Emberton III would get anywhere as loud, I was astonished by its sound quality. It has an engaging bass and clear mids, and it gets loud enough even in a mid-sized room that I don't bother taking any bigger speakers these days. Oh, and battery life is pretty great too, and I only charge the unit once a week.</p><p>It also gets physical controls via a jog-wheel, and that's another thing I like a lot. There's IP67 dust and water resistance as well, and on the whole, the Emberton III has proven to be nothing short of incredible in the three months I used it. So if you need a new Bluetooth speaker, I'd <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Marshall-Emberton-Portable-Bluetooth-Speaker/dp/B0DDCJMDJC">suggest just getting this one while it's at $149</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

UGREEN is doing much better in this area now, but UGOS still has some way to go.</p><p>Obviously, the hardware is the biggest selling point of the DXP4800 Plus. UGREEN somehow managed to deliver the best hardware in this category, and having this level of power in a 4-bay NAS is just great. The 12th Gen Intel platform does a terrific job, and you get hardware transcoding, a must-have if you use Plex and need it on older devices.</p><p>The 8GB of RAM and built-in SSD that houses the OS is good to see, and you get four HDD bays, two M.2 slots, and a metal chassis that's built to last. Another differentiator is 10 Gigabit Ethernet connectivity, ensuring the NAS easily holds its own for several years to come. What I also like is that there's 2.5GbE connectivity alongside it.</p><p>I also like the sheer customizability. If you don't like the software, you can just install TrueNAS Scale on the NAS, and that's just highly convenient. This is a big deal, and it makes using the DXP4800 Plus that much more enticing, as you can easily switch out the software — this isn't the case with most NAS brands. If you need a new 4-bay NAS, there isn't anything better in this category, and you should <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-DXP4800-Plus-Attached-Diskless/dp/B0D22JRHZB">get the DXP4800 Plus while it's still down to $559</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Powerbeats started it off in the early 2010s and have evolved into the Powerbeats Pro 2, which launched earlier this year. Then, in 2021, Beats expanded its workout earbud lineup to include the smaller, more versatile Beats Fit Pro. That model was just upgraded and rebranded to Powerbeats Fit.</p><p>The new features and name changes confirm what we already knew — Powerbeats Pro 2 and Powerbeats Fit are the two premier workout earbuds from Beats and represent some of the best options on the market for athletes. But which Powerbeats earbuds are best? Let's find out.</p><h2 id="beats-powerbeats-pro-2-vs-powerbeats-fit-design-and-fit-2">Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 vs. Powerbeats Fit: Design and fit</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="VJ9tx6oHLQdt3qZNeXEg6e" name="beats-powerbeats-fit-eartips.JPG" alt="Beats Powerbeats Fit" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VJ9tx6oHLQdt3qZNeXEg6e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>More so than sound quality or specs, the design and comfort of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/beats-powerbeats-fit-review">Powerbeats Fit</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/beats-powerbeats-pro-2-review">Powerbeats Pro 2</a> will set them apart for buyers. While the Powerbeats Pro 2 have a large ear hook that wraps around your ear lobe for maximum stability and security, the Powerbeats Fit have a stabilization trick of their own. The smaller Powerbeats Fit earbuds feature wing tips that create a secure fit against the concha of your outer ear. I still prefer the full ear hooks, but it's impossible to ignore how much lighter and more comfortable the Powerbeats Fit are due to the alternative design.</p><p>Compared to the Beats Fit Pro, the Powerbeats Fit have wing tips that are 20% more flexible. This means they should be more comfortable and easier to adjust to your individual ear shape. Beats also made a similar change with the Powerbeats Pro 2, making the entire ear hook more flexible. Our reviewer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/beats-powerbeats-fit-review">Tshaka Armstrong</a> found the Powerbeats Fit to be "incredibly comfortable, yet so locked in my ears," which is high praise for a set of workout earbuds.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eqDLaej3kzKTt9GnXtuPmC" name="Powerbeats-Pro-2-vs-Powerbeats-5" alt="The orange Powerbeats Pro 2 next to the Navy original Powerbeats Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eqDLaej3kzKTt9GnXtuPmC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The wing tips on the Powerbeats Fit offer a tighter fit in your ear than the Powerbeats Pro 2. The latter's ear hooks prevent the earbuds from physically falling out of your ears, but the ear tips can still slide out on occasion, requiring adjustments.</p><p>The Powerbeats Pro 2 have a larger footprint overall, including the large ear hooks. These earbuds also feature on-device controls, a volume rocker, and a playback button on both the left and right earbuds. While the Powerbeats Fit have a basic play/pause button on each earbud, they don't feature a volume rocker. I love using the volume controls on the Powerbeats Pro 2 to quickly raise or lower the volume of my music during a run without needing a smartwatch or phone.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="ZjjeCfAMGxQ8JcHr8uQmte" name="beats-powerbeats-fit-beats-vs-airpods-comparison.JPG" alt="Beats Powerbeats Fit" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZjjeCfAMGxQ8JcHr8uQmte.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">From left to right: Powerbeats Pro 2, Beats Fit Pro, Powerbeats Fit, AirPods </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>To fit the larger earbuds, the Powerbeats Pro 2 charging case is larger than the one for the Powerbeats Fit. It's pocketable, but barely. Meanwhile, the Powerbeats Fit case is compact and much more manageable. However, you give up wireless charging compatibility as the Powerbeats Fit case only supports USB-C.</p><p>To help you find a good fit, both Powerbeats models support the Ear Tip Fit Test, found in the iOS Settings app or the Beats app for Android. The Powerbeats Pro 2 ships with five ear tips in the box, ranging from extra small to extra large. Powerbeats Fit offers four, excluding the extra-large size option.</p><p>There is IPX4 certification for each Powerbeats version, which covers basic sweat-proofing and protection against light rain, but not much else. There's no dustproofing here, and only very limited water-resistance.</p><h2 id="beats-powerbeats-pro-2-vs-powerbeats-fit-sound-and-specs-2">Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 vs. Powerbeats Fit: Sound and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="3SLiHeJeUvBCPgSkLZm6Pd" name="beats-powerbeats-fit-earbud-macro-b-side.JPG" alt="Beats Powerbeats Fit" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3SLiHeJeUvBCPgSkLZm6Pd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While the Powerbeats Pro 2 have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/airpods-pro-3-review">AirPods Pro 3</a>-caliber internal components, the Powerbeats Fit use older hardware. Powerbeats Pro 2 feature the latest Apple H2 processor, which handles both digital signal processing and active noise cancellation. Powerbeats Fit still run on the Apple H1, an older but still competent audio chip.</p><p>Each set of earbuds features six onboard microphones for crisp calls and to support ANC features. The gyroscope, accelerometer, and optical sensors are also consistent between models. These sensors enable in-ear detection and automatic play/pause when the earbuds are placed in or removed from your ear.

Powerbeats Fit tend to have a V-shaped reproduction curve, where low- and high-end sounds can drown out the kids. Meanwhile, the Powerbeats Pro 2 have a flatter curve, with strong bass but more balanced overall.</p><p>I don't mind a pair of workout headphones with a bass-heavy sound signature — it can help in noisy environments, like a gym or track. Unfortunately, though, the lack of an EQ means you're locked into Beats' sound profile, and that could be a dealbreaker if you don't like it.</p><p>Both earbuds also support ANC and transparency mode. It's about on par with AirPods Pro and AirPods Pro 2 (meaning it's excellent), but it isn't as good as AirPods Pro 3. I tend to use transparency mode for workout headphones like the Powerbeats Pro 2 and Fit to stay aware of my surroundings while running on a path or road. The ANC support ensures that both models can double as everyday earbuds if you'd like.</p><h2 id="beats-powerbeats-pro-2-vs-powerbeats-fit-which-should-you-buy-2">Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 vs. Powerbeats Fit: Which should you buy?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5wfNzspPwM3T9cQCiKMWBD" name="Powerbeats-Pro-2-vs-Powerbeats-7" alt="The orange Powerbeats Pro 2 next to the Navy original Powerbeats Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5wfNzspPwM3T9cQCiKMWBD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For workouts, the absolute best earbuds for me are the Powerbeats Pro 2. The flexible ear hook effectively makes them drop-proof, the on-earbud controls are easy to use while running, and the newer Apple H2 chip enables new connectivity features. If you value similar things, you'll love the Powerbeats Pro 2. Throw in the built-in heart rate monitor as an added bonus, and it's pretty easy to justify the Powerbeats Pro 2's $50 price premium over the Powerbeats Fit.</p><p>That's not necessarily a knock against the Powerbeats Fit, because those earbuds are better as a daily driver. Due to their smaller size, lightweight design, and improved comfort, Powerbeats Fit can handle life outside of the gym better than Powerbeats Pro 2. They share many similarities with the first-generation AirPods Pro, except for wireless charging. The wing tip design should help them stay securely in your ear during long workouts.</p><p>If the Powerbeats Fit were a bit cheaper, they'd be an easier budget alternative to the Powerbeats Pro 2.

A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FRG18TLS"><strong>9% Black Friday discount</strong></a> may not sound like a lot, but when Garmin watches are typically quite pricey, any discount can help.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-venu-4-review">Garmin Venu 4</a> normally retails for $549, which is a $100 premium over its predecessor. Fortunately, this 9% discount brings that down to $499, which feels a bit more reasonable for a generational upgrade like this. This goes for both the 41mm and 45mm sizes, which are available in various color combinations. The leather band option is a bit pricier, but it still gets a price cut from $599 to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FRG1TXC6">as low as $537</a>.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><em><strong>Amazon's Black Friday week is LIVE: see the full list of deals</strong></em></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="03aa70d3-209b-4770-96db-37a37ff383c6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Price check: $499 at Best Buy" data-dimension48="Price check: $499 at Best Buy" data-dimension25="$499.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FRG18TLS" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="3egxn4mWgBFBcAPJYaZ6uC" name="garmin-venu-4-black-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3egxn4mWgBFBcAPJYaZ6uC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>The Garmin Venu 4 just got its first official sale, and while this $50 discount may not feel like much, it'll help ease the strain on your wallet for this great fitness watch.

It has tons of sports modes, meaning no matter what you're into, it's ready. Plus, despite a few blips here and there, the Elevate v5 sensor is quite accurate, which we've also noticed when testing other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/black-friday-garmin-deals-2025">Garmin watches</a> with the sensor.</p><p>If you lift weights like me, you'll enjoy the pretty accurate rep counter and automatic sets, which also time your rests in between. You can also input your weight into the watch after each set, meaning you can ditch the pen and paper.</p><p>If you're coming from an older <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a>, you may appreciate the newer UI. It's cleaner, faster, and makes more sense, so that anyone could pick it up and go.</p><p>You'll also appreciate features like Training Readiness, Health Status, and the sleep coach. All of these features, combined with Body Battery, are here to ensure that you're ready for whatever the day has in store.</p><p>You can set up a fitness plan in the Garmin app and follow it on the watch for easy guidance through your workout. And if you don't have a plan set up, the morning report will still surface daily workout recommendations to keep you moving. Post-workout details are also great, and the watch will even provide a visual representation of the muscles you worked out.</p><p>Oh, and while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-venu-4-fitness-heart-rate-steps">Venu 4</a> may have less battery life than its predecessor, it makes up for it by including a new flashlight, which gets pretty bright and can come in handy during night runs!</p><h2 id="black-friday-2025-quick-links-7">Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Vats quotes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/ya_sking12767/status/1993685977072635927">another tipster</a>, who alleges that Samsung has "set their plan" to kickstart a One UI 8.5 beta program on December 8, though that date could change. Vats hops in, claiming that others have said similar things, and that this could be the case for "Phase 1."</p><p>Phase 1 is likely just what may be One UI 8.5 Beta 1, with the tipster claiming that Beta 2 could begin two weeks later, on December 22. Moreover, it seems that each "phase" or beta could bring in a different set of users.</p><p>The first is supposedly for the U.S., Korea, the U.K., and Germany, while the latter is aimed at bringing in India and Poland.</p><p>This beta is supposedly expected to roll into the new year, with a One UI 8.5 Beta 3 preparing for a potential January 5 due date. These betas are roughly two weeks after each other, as Samsung seemingly looks to get this software tested and ready for its eventual release. Previous rumors have expected this beta to hit the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-launch">Galaxy S25 series</a> first, but users on X are wondering about a chance for the Galaxy S24, though nothing's been stated yet.</p><h2 id="it-s-beginning-to-look-a-lot-like-beta-time-2">It's beginning to look a lot like beta time</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Exclusive 👀I’m hearing the same from my sources — One UI 8.5 Beta 2 is expected around 22nd Dec, and Beta 3 around 5th Jan.This means:• Phase 1 users could get it on 8th Dec• Phase 2 users may get the One UI 8.5 beta on 22nd DecPhase 1: US, UK, Korea, GermanyPhase 2:… https://t.co/cu88FoieSH<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1993697461412798801">November 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>We've been playing with One UI 8.5 rumors since September, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/ui-8-5-beta-program-for-samsung-galaxy-late-this-fall-rumored">previous rumors claimed</a> we were headed toward a beta this fall. That alleged timeframe was supposedly for later in November, and while we're pretty much there now, the narrative has changed. Still, reports from October suggested that the first beta would roll out for U.S., Korean, and European users, similar to the current trend from X.</p><p>Several weeks after, shortly before Halloween, rumors said that Samsung was looking <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/one-ui-8-5-beta-reportedly-delayed">to hold off on a November beta</a>, as it grappled with Galaxy S26 series changes.</p><p>The delay part here is reportedly due to Samsung dropping the Galaxy S26 Plus for a Galaxy S26 Edge. However, it seems that this may no longer happen, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-developing-galaxy-s26-after-all">as the S25 Edge suffered low sales</a>. Either way, One UI 8.5 has been positioned as quite a substantial update, which could debut alongside the Galaxy S26 next year during its alleged San Francisco <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-may-have-locked-in-the-galaxy-s26-launch-date">Unpacked event</a> in February. AI notifications, new Quick Settings, lock screen customization, and more are all expected to arrive in this new software update.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Plex is enforcing a new restriction that effectively blocks remote video playback on Roku TV models.</p><p>Beginning this week, Plex will require users to pay for a subscription, either a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/this-is-your-last-chance-to-buy-a-lifetime-plex-pass-before-prices-double">Plex Pass</a> or a new, lower-cost Remote Watch Pass, to stream personal media remotely to Roku devices, the company announced in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://forums.plex.tv/t/changes-coming-to-remote-streaming-on-roku/933671" target="_blank">forum post</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.howtogeek.com/plex-is-now-enforcing-remote-play-restrictions-on-tvs/" target="_blank">How-To Geek</a>). So, if you usually watch movies or shows from your home server while away, you’ll now need a paid pass.</p><p>Plex has a reason for this change. Earlier this year, the company updated how remote playback works for personal media libraries, so remote streaming is no longer free. Now, it is included as part of a subscription, either with Plex Pass or the new Remote Watch Pass.</p><p>Previously, Plex users could connect to their home media servers from anywhere and stream content for free, which was a major draw for fans of self-hosting.</p><h2 id="you-now-need-one-of-two-paid-passes-2">You now need one of two paid passes</h2><p>Here’s how the new setup works now. If you or the media server administrator holds a Plex Pass, remote streaming remains seamless. All existing features, such as remote access and streaming, plus extra perks like skip-intro and transcoding, carry on as before.</p><p>For those who don’t need the full range of Plex Pass features, the Remote Watch Pass provides a more accessible option for unlocking remote streaming of personal media. Previously, it was possible to share a media server with friends or family and allow free streaming on their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-roku">Roku devices</a>; moving forward, a subscription will be required to continue remote access.</p><p>That shift doesn’t just hit Roku. Plex says this paywall will roll out to other TV platforms — like Fire TV, Apple TV, and Android TV — and potentially to third-party clients that use Plex’s API sometime in 2026.</p><p>If you’re interested in maintaining flexibility, you have two choices: purchase a pass (Plex Pass or Remote Watch Pass) or explore alternative options.</p> ]]></dc:content>

As if that wasn't enough, Samsung's Black Friday deal is sweetening the deal by giving you access to some additional bundle discounts (such as 52% off the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro), six months of Google AI Pro, a six-month subscription to SiriusXM streaming, and more.

It's launched Black Friday deals for its old Wayfarer models, with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/ray-ban-meta-wayfarer-large-gen-1-glasses-with-meta-ai-audio-photo-video-compatibility-green-lenses-shiny-black/BCKVZQ48SG"><strong>G15 Green and Clear Wayfarers at $238 ($60 off)</strong></a> and its more popular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/ray-ban-meta-wayfarer-large-gen-1-glasses-with-meta-ai-audio-photo-video-compatibility-polarized-gradient-graphite-lenses-matte-black/BCKVZQ48S4"><strong>Matte Black Wayfarers with Polarized Graphite lenses at $263 ($66 off)</strong></a>. Meta glasses have <em>never</em> gotten a major sale in the 2+ years since launch, making this a rare opportunity.</p><p>In some ways, this deal is a trap. Meta <strong>just</strong> launched its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-gen-2-review">Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) glasses</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oakley-meta-vanguard-smart-glasses-review">Oakley Meta Vanguard glasses</a>, both of which I gave glowing reviews. I particularly loved how Meta improved battery life this generation, while the first-gen models have shorter battery life by comparison.</p><p>Here's the problem: the new Ray-Bans start at $379, or $409 with polarized lenses, while Vanguard launched at $499, and I don't expect either device to get a major discount until 2027, based on past history. If you're shopping for your first smart glasses, it makes <em>much</em> more sense to buy the first-gen glasses for less and see if you like them or not; they'll last you until Meta's third-generation glasses in a couple of years.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="0fd42638-d25e-423f-859f-df92488d1f05" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="or: Wayfarer (Gen 1) Polarized Graphite: $329" data-dimension48="or: Wayfarer (Gen 1) Polarized Graphite: $329" data-dimension25="$239.20" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/ray-ban-meta-wayfarer-glasses-with-meta-ai-audio-photo-video-compatibility-green-lenses-shiny-black/BCKVZQ48PC" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1562px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="FWzQpn9qgLFJPxHMVokrFB" name="Ray-Ban-Meta-smart-glasses-wayfarer-render.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FWzQpn9qgLFJPxHMVokrFB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1562" height="1562" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>or: Wayfarer (Gen 1) Polarized Graphite: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/ray-ban-meta-wayfarer-glasses-with-meta-ai-audio-photo-video-compatibility-polarized-gradient-graphite-lenses-matte-black/BCKVZQZ5S6" data-dimension112="0fd42638-d25e-423f-859f-df92488d1f05" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="or: Wayfarer (Gen 1) Polarized Graphite: $329" data-dimension48="or: Wayfarer (Gen 1) Polarized Graphite: $329" data-dimension25="$239.20"><del>$329</del> <strong>$263.20 at Best Buy</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review"><strong>Android Central verdict: </strong>★★★★</a></p><p>The original Ray-Ban Meta glasses blew up in a way no one expected, selling millions of units on the strength of its high-res photography, open-ear audio, and Meta AI insights.

I specify "available" because, as you might expect from a normal physical library, there are only so many copies of each book available.</p><p>That's because a digital library system works just like a physical one: your local library system only owns so many copies (licenses) of each digital book. Once all those copies have been borrowed, you'll have to register for a waitlist until someone returns a copy.</p><p>Everyone's home screen will look a little different depending on how your local library organizes things. My North Carolina digital library lets me quickly sort books by newest, most popular, or "available now" by tapping the icons at the top of the Libby home screen. Scrolling down also gives me a curated list of options that sometimes makes it easier to find what I need.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6xMMwfpZTfMxQTLib9VWXY" name="Bigme-B6-libby-app-ai-recommendations" alt="Using the AI suggestion tool in the Libby App on a Bigme B6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6xMMwfpZTfMxQTLib9VWXY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Clicking the magnifying glass icon lets you search for any title or author, and you can specify if you want books, audiobooks, or magazines.

According to a recent report by the Financial Times (as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/11/25/spotify-planning-us-price-hike-in-early-2026-report-claims/">9to5 Google</a>), there has been some chatter that the streaming platform may increase prices for U.S. customers early next year.</p><p>Spotify increased its prices for subscribers in the U.S. back in 2024, when the cost of the every tier went up significantly, the Family plan experienced the largest jump, rising by $3 to reach $19.99 per month, while the Duo plan increased by $2 to and Individual plan went up to $11.99. Amidst these widespread increases, the Student plan was the only option to remain unchanged, holding steady at $5.99.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="CfNXmNKkCC8CdfEWrjzDfB" name="Spotify" alt="Spotify Premium Platinum plan details in India" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CfNXmNKkCC8CdfEWrjzDfB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>But if these rumors are indeed true, then it would mean U.S. users are facing their third price increase in less than three years (July 2023, July 2024, and potentially Q1 2026).</p><p>And while we don't know for sure how much each specific plan will see an increase, if Spotify follows its similar pattern from the previous years, then the multi-user plans may see a higher price point when compared to individual plans. Considering that these plans involve multiple people, cancelling the subscription is more of a hassle as it affects the entire household.</p><h2 id="why-this-sudden-hike-2">Why this sudden hike?</h2><p>Reports <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/spotify-may-increase-subscription-prices-in-the-us-next-year/articleshow/125559259.cms">suggest</a> that Spotify is being pressurized by major music labels (Universal, Sony, Warner) to raise prices. These labels feel that music subscriptions are capped at a lower cost compared to video services like Netflix or Disney Plus, which have raised prices multiple times recently.</p><p>This potential price increase could also be linked to the renewal of Spotify's licensing deals with these labels. New agreements are expected to include clauses that would result in higher royalty payments, costs that Spotify may pass on to its subscribers.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3958px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="egZqqnKeSfVHiy34hWAP8U" name="Spotify-Smart-Shuffle" alt="Spotify Shuffle options" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/egZqqnKeSfVHiy34hWAP8U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3958" height="2226" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Furthermore, this could benefit Spotify's financial standing as well.

The HBO Max and STARZ add-ons usually cost $9.99 and $10.99 per month, respectively, so this $2.99 per month deal is no joke. That being said, this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/black-friday">Black Friday</a> streaming deal is set to expire on December 1st, so you only have a few more days.

Because of that, I swapped my Pixel Watch 3 with an Amazfit T-Rex 3 earlier this year and haven't looked back since. Now you can get the same great experience <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazfit-Outdoor-Navigation-Satellite-Freediving/dp/B0DCZ9PRCP/"><strong>for $53 less</strong></a> with this excellent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/black-friday">Black Friday</a> deal. But if you want the best deal possible this week, Amazon's excellent Renewed program will get you a refurbished T-Rex 3 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazfit-Refurbished-Military-Water-Resistant-Smartwatch/dp/B0DJ7S43SK/"><strong>for just $159</strong></a> out the door. The catch is that the latter deal only applies to Prime members.</p><p>The Amazfit T-Rex 3 is an incredibly impressive smartwatch with a gorgeous AMOLED screen, one month battery life (seriously!), and support for tracking 170 different sports and types of workouts. It's also got offline dual-band GPS for epic accuracy, a free diving mode, and more.</p><p>Last weekend, I took it on a third Spartan race for this year, and it performed as exemplary as I expected. That dual-band GPS is perfect for tracking your runs accurately, even in dense cities, and I'd be willing to bet it's more accurate than any older smartwatch you're wearing right now. And even with all this regular tracking, I still only charge it about once a month.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="9030aa34-7262-44aa-97bd-8affdd5fe4e6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="⌚ Amazfit T-Rex 3: $279.99" data-dimension48="⌚ Amazfit T-Rex 3: $279.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazfit-Outdoor-Navigation-Satellite-Freediving/dp/B0DCZ9PRCP/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1316px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:105.55%;"><img id="CateFeyUxRYuoGPqCc4cNG" name="Amazfit T-Rex 3 product image" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CateFeyUxRYuoGPqCc4cNG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1316" height="1389" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>⌚ Amazfit T-Rex 3: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazfit-Outdoor-Navigation-Satellite-Freediving/dp/B0DCZ9PRCP/" data-dimension112="9030aa34-7262-44aa-97bd-8affdd5fe4e6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="⌚ Amazfit T-Rex 3: $279.99" data-dimension48="⌚ Amazfit T-Rex 3: $279.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$279.99 </del><strong>$226 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>👉 <strong>Buy Renewed and save even more!: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazfit-Refurbished-Military-Water-Resistant-Smartwatch/dp/B0DJ7S43SK/"><strong>$159.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit/best-amazfit-smartwatches">Amazfit</a> has made a name for itself over the years by providing substantial value with its fitness-focused smartwatches, and the T-Rex 3 is a stellar flagship watch from the company.

It automatically counts my reps while running strength training or other lifting exercises built into the watch, and it's super simple to switch sets and weight with quick 5lb increments.</p><p>Just like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watches</a>, Amazfit's Zepp app tracks the muscles you use for each type of workout and often does a great job of automatically identifying certain types of workouts. If I'm doing barbell backsquats, for instance, I just start the "strength training" exercise on the watch, and it typically understands that I'm doing barbell backsquats based on my movements. It's really cool, and you can always easily change the workout from the app at any time after the fact.</p><p>The Amazfit T-Rex 3 goes beyond just workout tracking and everyday notification management, too. The Zepp app, used to connect the watch to your phone, has a great UI that's insightful and user-friendly. Part of that is made possible by Amazfit's clever use of AI to surface information you're looking for, and the other half is just good design.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:67.72%;"><img id="NMypiorMyVi5Dk458HLYJW" name="amazfit-zepp-app-ai-powered-food-logging" alt="Logging food in the Zepp app easily with AI voice prompts and photos" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NMypiorMyVi5Dk458HLYJW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1387" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of my favorite parts of the app is the AI-powered meal tracking capabilities, which let you type or voice a natural language prompt to input meals. That means no more scanning barcodes or scrolling through lists of junk.</p><p>Just tell it, "I had 2 scrambled eggs, a piece of buttered toast, and a glass of orange juice for breakfast," and it uses AI to understand and input that into your daily log quickly.

Thanks to various leaks and rumors, we have a rough idea of what to expect. What has me most excited, though, is not the new processor or the cameras, but the new design. If all goes well, we should finally get a Galaxy Ultra phone that has proper ergonomics for daily use. Samsung has a strong contender from China in the form of the Xiaomi 17 Pro Max.</p><p>This is technically the first phone to ship with the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chip, but it is not available globally yet. The most interesting thing about it is the giant display on the back of the phone, which opens up new and interesting ways of interacting with your apps and content. We expect the 17 Pro Max to be available in more countries, apart from China, by the time the Galaxy S26 Ultra launches, and this makes it yet another strong competitor.</p><p>If you're wondering which is the better phone between the Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra vs. Xiaomi 17 Pro Max, we've got you covered.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-ultra-vs-xiaomi-17-pro-max-design-and-display-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra vs. Xiaomi 17 Pro Max: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1420px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="CJ3tKHPmEXBczgC7e3A7iW" name="galaxy-s26-ultra-renders-2" alt="Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CJ3tKHPmEXBczgC7e3A7iW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1420" height="799" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-s26-ultra-and-s26-pro-could-get-a-subtle-but-noticeable-reshuffle">new design</a> looks very interesting. It's not so much the camera placement that's changing but the ergonomics of the phone. The curvier corners should make it a lot more pocketable and easier to use with one hand. A more recent leak hints that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-leak-reveals-slimmer-lighter-flagships-that-one-up-apples-new-iphones">new weight</a> of the Ultra is expected to be 214 grams. This is four grams lower than the S25 Ultra and five grams less than the Xiaomi 17 Pro Max. The thickness is also expected to be 7.9mm, which is just a smidge below the 8mm of the Pro Max.</p><p>We don't know if Samsung will increase the size of the display, but it should be at least 6.9 inches like the current model. You can also expect a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-s26-ultra-might-pack-a-display-that-hides-your-screen-from-prying-side-glances">Privacy Display feature</a>, which could be the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsungdisplay.com/eng/media/news/detail/ssdsNews-240227.jsp" target="_blank"> “Flex Magic Pixel” technology</a> we've heard of before.

The main screen measures 6.9 inches with a 2,608x1,200 resolution and a 120Hz LTPO AMOLED display. Peak brightness is an impressive 3,500 nits, and the screen is protected by Xiaomi's Dragon Crystal Glass 3. What's more impressive is the rear 2.9-inch LTPO AMOLED that carries the same peak brightness and 120Hz refresh rate. It also supports Dolby Vision playback, which is unique.</p><p>The 17 Pro Max is a large phone too, weighing 219 grams, and is nearly as slim as the Galaxy. Xiaomi has given it an IP68 rating, which is something we're also expecting for the S26 Ultra (if not better). Apart from having a display on the back of the phone, the design is pretty standard with a metal and glass construction, and flat sides with curved edges.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-ultra-vs-xiaomi-17-pro-max-performance-and-specs-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra vs. Xiaomi 17 Pro Max: Performance and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xjB8J3TW4uEYHxikamyM6d" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S26-lineup" alt="CAD renders of the Galaxy S26 lineup including the Ultra and Pro models" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xjB8J3TW4uEYHxikamyM6d.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Smartprix)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Galaxy S26 Ultra is only expected to arrive in early 2026, and prices should start at $1,299.99 or be $100 more if the price hike rumor turns out to be true. In any case, this is going to be a much more expensive smartphone than the Xiaomi 17 Pro Max. Keep in mind that this is just the base pricing, which means if you want to get 512GB or 1TB of storage, be prepared to pay up to $1,800.</p><p>We don't know this for sure yet, but the Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra should use a custom version of Qualcomm's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 SoC</a>, just like previous generations. Benchmarks should be slightly better than what the 17 Pro Max can put out, but we'll have to wait and see. The phone should also come with at least 12GB of RAM and up to 1TB of storage. We should also hopefully get the latest UFS 4.1 storage type for quicker read and write speeds.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KtmcyZz4AEJ4pVpc3iNamg" name="xiaomi-17-pro-max-render-gaming-case-androidcentral" alt="Xiaomi 17 Pro Max render gaming case for rear display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KtmcyZz4AEJ4pVpc3iNamg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Xiaomi)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Xiaomi 17 Pro Max hasn't launched globally yet, but converting the China price of 5,999 Yuan gives us roughly $840. Even with taxes, it should be under $1,000 when it does eventually launch. It comes in Black, White, Purple, and Green. The Pro Max is powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chip and comes with 12GB or 16GB of RAM. Storage starts at 256GB and goes up to 1TB.</p><p>Battery capacity of the Xiaomi 17 Pro Max is one area where the Galaxy S26 Ultra can't possibly compete. It has a 7,500mAh battery, which is even larger than that of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-review">OnePlus 15</a>. The Pro Max gets really quick charging of 100W wired and 50W wireless. It can even do 22.5W reverse wireless charging, which is simply bonkers.

It's called Remix in Google Messages, and the feature uses the Nano Banana image-generation model to alter an image right inside the app. It brings Gemini's growing image-generation chops directly inside your Messages chats.</p><p>Before long, you'll probably run into a remixed photo in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-first-things-to-do">Google Messages</a>, or want to try creating one yourself. In this guide, we'll cover everything you need to know about the feature and how to get started using it.</p><h2 id="what-is-remix-in-google-messages-2">What is Remix in Google Messages?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:54.48%;"><img id="PnRxq5BeNa5uCA6jQhhxcG" name="Pixel-Drop-Google-Messages-Remix" alt="Remix in Google Messages showing a dog with various AI-generated versions" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PnRxq5BeNa5uCA6jQhhxcG.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1046" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Remix in Google Messages is a new feature that started rolling out to all users in November 2025. It's opt-in, so the first time you use it, you'll need to press <strong>Continue</strong> to agree to the terms and conditions. Like Google's other generative AI tools, you'll agree to use Remix in Google Messages responsibly and must avoid breaking the company's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://policies.google.com/terms/generative-ai/use-policy" target="_blank">generative AI prohibited use policy</a>. If your prompt falls under one of these uses, it might not work.</p><p>The feature effectively brings Nano Banana, also known as Gemini 2.5 Flash Image, to the Messages app. Google calls it "the latest way you can have fun with your friends." You start by picking a photo, giving <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-nano-banana-ai-image-tool-is-taking-over-your-favorite-apps">Nano Banana</a> a prompt that will "remix it," and sharing the end result with a person or group. It's widely rolling out, but users must be 18 or older to use it.</p><h2 id="how-to-use-remix-in-google-messages-2">How to use Remix in Google Messages</h2><p>Google Messages' Remix feature brings the Nano Banana model straight into your chats. You can alter an image, reimagine it, or even create something entirely new without leaving the Messages app. It'll work regardless of what phones your friends have — as long as they're using the Google Messages app, they can see your remixes and reply with their own.</p><p>Here's the step-by-step process for using Remix in Google Messages:</p><p>1. Open the <strong>Google Messages app</strong>, and <strong>select a photo</strong>. (This can be a photo that's already been sent or a new one from your gallery.)</p><p>2. Long-press the photo and tap the <strong>Remix button</strong>.</p><p>3. Tap one of the <strong>suggestion chips</strong> or <strong>type a prompt</strong>.</p><p>4. Press to <strong>continue </strong>and generate your image.</p><p>5. Tap <strong>Done</strong> to finish or <strong>Remix</strong> to try again.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="voK6CZNPRqLR6Xd4eHTwBc" name="Remix-Google-Messages-Screenshots" alt="The Remix feature in Google Messages." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/voK6CZNPRqLR6Xd4eHTwBc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>After finishing, you'll have a new image created in part using Google's Nano Banana image-generation model.

Previously, users could chat with Gemini within the Messages app, instead of using the dedicated Gemini app.</p><p>The same is true of the Remix feature in Google Messages. It's powered by the exact same Nano Banana image-generation model used in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini app</a> — the Remix in Google Messages tool is simply there for convenience.</p><p>Not every user will find Remix in Google Messages useful, and some might completely ignore it.

It tosses aside OnePlus' unique design language for conformity, and ditches features like a QHD+ display and Hasselblad image processing. It's especially disappointing when you compare the OnePlus 15 to the OPPO Find X9 Pro, a similar but very different handset. Now that OnePlus and OPPO have been under the same company for a while, the lines between their phone models are blurrier than ever.</p><p>The choice between the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-review">OnePlus 15</a> and the OPPO Find X9 Pro will almost certainly come down to regional availability. While the Find X9 Pro is sold in the U.K., it's not available in North America. The OnePlus 15 is sold in Canada and will be available in the U.S. once the brand gets its FCC certifications sorted out. But, there's always the option of importing the OnePlus 15 or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/oppo-find-x9-pro-review">OPPO Find X9 Pro</a> into your country.</p><p>So, which is the best option? Let's compare the OnePlus 15 and the OPPO Find X9 Pro to find out.</p><h2 id="oneplus-15-vs-oppo-find-x9-pro-design-and-display-2">OnePlus 15 vs. OPPO Find X9 Pro: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5126px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="knTtyyXRVbhUCB9gBC86mW" name="OnePlus 15" alt="OnePlus 15 camera review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/knTtyyXRVbhUCB9gBC86mW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5126" height="2887" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>OnePlus and OPPO each made the decision to lean into conventional smartphone design trends, which recently favored boxy, flat, and rectangular chassis. As such, the OnePlus 15 and OPPO Find X9 Pro each lose their curves and circular rear camera arrangement in favor of a new, standard slab design. The phones look more boring as a result, and clever leather finish options are gone. They look like an iPhone, which is the look many phone brands are going for in 2025.</p><p>The look and feel of the OnePlus 15 and OPPO Find X9 Pro will be consistent across both devices, but there are differences. Each phone has a square-ish camera bump on the top-left corner of the device's back. However, the Find X9 Pro's flash lives outside the bump, and there's a Hasselblad logo where you'd find the flash on the OnePlus 15. The OPPO logo on the Find X9 Pro is near the bottom of the device and is more subtle, whereas the OnePlus logo on the 15 is centered, with black font that stands out.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="G9HWge6z7CKFf8JYzfVCd9" name="OPPO Find X9 Pro" alt="OPPO Find X9 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/G9HWge6z7CKFf8JYzfVCd9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's a lot of talk about the OnePlus 15's display and its apparent downgrades, but the changes won't matter much in this comparison. It's true that OnePlus swapped its QHD+ display with a 3K resolution on the OnePlus 13 for a new, 1.5K panel on the OnePlus 15. However, the OPPO Find X line never had a 3K panel, so there's no love lost here. The OPPO Find X9 Pro sports the same display as the prior generation, and it has the same 1.5K resolution as the OnePlus 15.</p><p>OnePlus technically has the edge here, as its 1.5K AMOLED display can reach 165Hz on the OnePlus 15. This is designed for gaming, where the extra frame rates matter — the phone will default to 120Hz in most situations. Meanwhile, the OPPO Find X9 Pro's display panel tops out at 120Hz in all situations. Both use LTPO technologies to add smoothness and responsiveness for scrolling and animations.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4966px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="hFpkA4kc5uUVtxoPo2ZwDN" name="OnePlus 15" alt="OnePlus 15 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hFpkA4kc5uUVtxoPo2ZwDN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4966" height="2797" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Each phone has a 6.78-inch screen, but the Find X9 Pro's display bezels are over a millimeter smaller than its predecessor.</p><p>The OnePlus 15 and the OPPO Find X9 Pro each have an aluminum chassis with IP69 certifications against dust and water ingress.

However, it also runs hot, and this has already started to become an issue for early OnePlus 15 testers. It's paired with either 12GB or 16GB of memory, depending on your storage configuration.</p><p>OPPO uses the MediaTek Dimensity 9500 processor to drive the Find X9 Pro, and this is also a current-generation 3nm chip. You get 16GB of RAM as standard with the Find X9 Pro, which will be helpful for AI tasks and gaming. In our testing of the MediaTek-powered Find X9 Pro, we learned that this phone and chip combo can hang with the best of the best in performance, while running cooler than its competitors.</p><div ><table><caption>Specs</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>OnePlus 15</p></th><th  ><p>Oppo Find X9 Pro</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.78-inch 1.5K AMOLED, 165Hz Adaptive Refresh Rate</p></td><td  ><p>6.78-inch LTPO AMOLED, 120Hz, 2772x1272, Dolby Vision, 3600 nits max</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</p></td><td  ><p>MediaTek Dimensity 9500</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>12GB / 16GB</p></td><td  ><p>16GB LPDDR5X</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 512GB UFS 4.1</p></td><td  ><p>512GB UFS 4.1</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 1</p></td><td  ><p>50MP Wide, f/1.8, 24mm</p></td><td  ><p>50MP 1/1.28-inch f/1.5 Sony Lytia LYT-828, 23mm, 4K120 Dolby Vision video, OIS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 2</p></td><td  ><p>50MP Periscope telephoto, f/2.8, 80mm</p></td><td  ><p>200MP 1/1.56-inch f/2.1 Samsung HP5 telephoto, 70mm, 3x optical zoom, OIS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 3</p></td><td  ><p>50MP Ultrawide, f/2.0,  16mm</p></td><td  ><p>50MP 1/2.75-inch f/2.0 Samsung JN5, 15mm wide-angle lens</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Front Camera</p></td><td  ><p>32MP wide, f/2.4</p></td><td  ><p>50MP Samsung JN5</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ingress Protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP69</p></td><td  ><p>IP69</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>5G, Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6.0</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6.0, global 5G bands, NFC, dual-band GPS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>7,300mAh</p></td><td  ><p>7,500mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging</p></td><td  ><p>80-100W/120W wired, 50W wireless, 10W reverse wireless, 5W reverse wired</p></td><td  ><p>80W wired charging, 50W wireless charging</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>161.4 x 76.7 x 8.1 mm</p></td><td  ><p>161.2 x 76.4 x 8.2mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>211g or 215g</p></td><td  ><p>224g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>OxygenOS 16 w/ Android 16</p></td><td  ><p>ColorOS 16 based on Android 16</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Both handsets support the latest connectivity standards, including 5G, Wi-Fi 7, and Bluetooth 6.0.

It also marks the end of OnePlus' partnership with Hasselblad, and the introduction of the company's in-house DetailMax Engine for image processing. In our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-camera-review">camera review,</a> we found that the OnePlus 15's main camera performs well in most situations, despite using a smaller 1/1.56-inch sensor size. However, the experience overall is inconsistent, but still better than what we get from Google and Samsung here in North America.</p><p>With that being said, the OPPO Find X9 Pro keeps the Hasselblad partnership and still sports industry-leading camera hardware. It has a new 50MP f/1.5 Sony LYT-828 sensor made in collaboration with Sony, plus a 200MP telephoto camera offering 3x optical zoom. It can also shoot 4K120 video, a major improvement compared to its predecessor. Overall, you can expect the Find X9 Pro to outperform the OnePlus 15 in camera quality, especially if you prefer Hasselblad's take on post-processing.</p><p>The front-facing camera battle goes to the Find X9 Pro, too — it has a 50MP sensor compared to the OnePlus 15's 32MP sensor.</p><h2 id="oneplus-15-vs-oppo-find-x9-pro-which-should-you-buy-2">OnePlus 15 vs. OPPO Find X9 Pro: Which should you buy?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="XASQHE3tpRwjHQ3oKSWJZe" name="oneplus-15-display-lock-screen-themes-03" alt="A themed lockscreen using the OnePlus 15's built-in Flux Themes engine" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XASQHE3tpRwjHQ3oKSWJZe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While the OPPO Find X9 Pro makes some of the same mistakes as the OnePlus 15, it doesn't make as many of them. Sure, the Find X9 Pro similarly loses its unique design language for another flat rectangle. It also retains its standout camera system and a Hasselblad partnership for sharper image processing. Usually, I'd give the OnePlus 15 credit for its use of a Qualcomm Snapdragon chip, but the phone's overheating concerns might cancel out the positive benefits.</p><p>Meanwhile, the OnePlus 15's gaming-focused features are a bright spot, especially the raw performance, long battery life during intensive tasks, and 165Hz display. Those changes won't resonate with everyone, though. For the average consumer, the OnePlus 15 may be worse than the OnePlus 13 on paper. If you have the choice between the OPPO Find X9 Pro and the OnePlus 15, I'd argue the scales tip in favor of OPPO.</p><p>Still, availability will be the biggest factor. You <em>can</em> import the OPPO Find X9 Pro into the U.S., but there are risks, especially with carrier compatibility and supported cellular bands. That means if you want an OPPO/OnePlus phone in North America, the OnePlus 15 is your only real option.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="e169d00b-15ca-4f5c-a76b-cb94f4156d64">            <a href="https://www.oneplus.com/us/oneplus-15" data-model-name="OnePlus 15" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KTcf69eMUZC6mgdp6F2uYJ.jpg' alt="OnePlus 15"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">OnePlus 15</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>For North American buyers</strong></em></p><p>The OnePlus 15 is the only option for buyers in the U.S. and Canada.

The tipster discovered that Google is looking to place this "Projects" feature in the side panel of the Gemini app. From there, users can tap "New Project" and begin working, but Google's development gives a small description of the feature.</p><p>According to the post, Google's code states users can "Add up to 10 files that Gemini can reference throughout your project."</p><p>The publication likens this supposed Gemini feature to OpenAI's "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/10169521-projects-in-chatgpt">Projects in ChatGPT</a>." The company's support page for this feature states this feature is all about context, as users can upload files, instructions, and more for the AI in that project session to help keep it "on topic." Speculation claims that Google is moving in this direction, too, which is furthered by the development's little tid-bit: "projects keep your work and ideas organized. You can add context and tell Gemini how to help."</p><p>Google is seemingly continuing down this path of a more personalized or "focused" AI, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/gemini-notebooklm-gaming-guide-creation">kind of like NotebookLM</a> (in a way).</p><p>At the moment, the tipster was unable to surface more of Gemini's Projects, specifically, how this would work. Right now, they were able to get as far as the "Give your project a name" screen, right before "create project" becomes accessible. It's probably safe to say Google will have a more expansive screen after this, one that gives users a chance to upload their files and enter in their instructions, per the leaked descriptors.</p><h2 id="a-more-personal-focused-ai-2">A more personal, focused AI</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:269px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:223.05%;"><img id="UAWzjy3DmTFUcayUHbWQfL" name="google-gemini-projects-feature-leak" alt="The Gemini app displays a "Projects" section in its side menu, which, per the leaks, could help users focus the AI on specific topics." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UAWzjy3DmTFUcayUHbWQfL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="269" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Funnily enough, it seems that Google is working on bringing NotebookLM to Gemini in a future update; at least, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-and-notebooklm-could-work-even-closer-together-in-a-future-update">that's what the rumors suggest</a>. It seems that the company will expand its "Attachments" menu in the Gemini app to include the option to import your NotebookLM notebooks. This importing feature would also include sources, if this actually progresses to a stable launch.</p><p>Google is really trying to blur the lines between Gemini and its focused NotebookLM model to help users research, understand, and sift through heavy information and research. Each side has its strengths, which is also something Google may want to capitalize on by merging them and showing users their varying uses all in one place.</p><p>Other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-gemini-app-huge-flash-thinking-model-updates-announced">updates for Gemini</a> include a more personalized experience, which is tailored to the user and their interests/needs, based on their Search behavior.

Google said it planned to make "switching content between devices seamless with apps like YouTube Music and Spotify." Additionally, this feature was supposed to be present within your notifications.

The redesign (and complete rebrand) updated things to Find Hub from Find My Device. This update also brought the "People" tab out of beta, meaning users can find people they'd like to share their location with through that interface. Google also teased two new features headed for Find Hub later this year: precision finding with UWB and satellite connectivity.</p><p>An update <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-users-can-now-pick-their-preferred-google-find-hub-measurement-units">just a couple of weeks ago</a> brought the ability for users to choose their desired unit of measurement, as well as an updated list of supported trackers.</p> ]]></dc:content>

As Black Friday hits, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D7HVZVRZ"><strong>Amazon has slashed 32% off the price of the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL</strong>,</a> which is a capable last-gen phone that still holds up pretty well.</p><p>We liked the 9 Pro XL upon its release, especially for its slightly faster charging speeds and larger screen than its 9 Pro sibling device. It features an incredibly vibrant 6.8-inch AMOLED display, three powerful rear cameras, and a seven-year software update promise that will future-proof the device despite it being a last-gen pick.</p><p>This particular deal is for the 128GB storage version of the phone, though Google also offers 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB configurations if you need more storage. Other things we liked about this phone include its long battery life and powerful performance, both of which make it stand up tall even next to some of the best phones of 2025.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/blackfriday"><em><strong>See the full list of deals from Amazon's Black Friday sale</strong></em></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,099" data-dimension48="$1,099" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D7HVZVRZ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1144px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:131.12%;"><img id="8traMGgrwAvoqr8vUr6kdH" name="9-pro-xl.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8traMGgrwAvoqr8vUr6kdH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1144" height="1500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Google Pixel 9 Pro XL:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D7HSJ7ZP" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,099" data-dimension48="$1,099" data-dimension25=""><del>$1,099</del> <strong>$749 for Amazon's Black Friday sale</strong></a></p><p>The Google Pixel 9 Pro XL is a solid last-gen phone, offering fairly similar specs to the newer 10 Pro XL.

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>When I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi/poco-f7-ultra-review">reviewed the POCO F7 Ultra</a>, I called it the best bargain of 2025. The combination of hardware, design, and battery life made it a great choice, but where the device truly stood out was the cameras. POCO always struggled in this area, but the F7 Ultra proved that the brand could deliver a phone with terrific cameras.</p><p>With the F8 Ultra, POCO is once again changing just about everything. The phone has an all-new design, and the denim texture that the brand is using at the back is unique — and it feels wonderful. There's a much bigger 6,500mAh battery, a bigger AMOLED panel, and new cameras at the back, including a dedicated 5x lens.</p><p>Obviously, the phone uses the latest Qualcomm silicon, and intriguingly, you get stereo sound along with a standalone subwoofer driver, with the sound powered by Bose.</p><p>While just about everything on the phone has changed from the F7 Ultra, what's still the same is the focus on value — the F8 Ultra costs a lot less than other phones that have the same hardware. Having used the phone for just over two weeks, I don't understand why you need to buy any other phone.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-poco-f8-ultra-pricing-and-availability"><span>POCO F8 Ultra: Pricing and availability</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="4CPiYgZhqVCCvCyTrS8CpN" name="POCO F8 Ultra" alt="POCO F8 Ultra review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4CPiYgZhqVCCvCyTrS8CpN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>POCO unveiled the F8 Ultra and F8 Pro at a launch event in Bali, Indonesia on November 26, 2025. Both phones are going on sale globally, and they will be available in India, the U.K., and other key markets where POCO has a presence. The F8 Ultra is available in 12GB/256GB and 16GB/512GB editions, and POCO is selling the device in Denim Blue and Black models.</p><p>There's also the F8 Pro, and that device is sold in 12GB/256GB and 12GB/512GB variants, and you get Titanium Silver, Blue, and Black models. POCO is raising the prices this year, but it isn't by much, so that's good to see.

Alongside the phones, POCO debuted the POCO Pad X1 at $399, and the tablet has plenty of great new features. There's also the Pad M1 at $329, with this model featuring a huge battery. I'm focusing on the phones this time, but I'll have plenty to talk about regarding the Pad X1 and M1 shortly.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>POCO F8 Ultra</p></th><th  ><p>POCO F8 Pro</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.9-inch 120Hz AMOLED, 2608x1200, 2560Hz PWM, 2000 nits HBM</p></td><td  ><p>6.59-inch 120Hz AMOLED, 2510x1156, 2560Hz PWM, 2000 nits HBM</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>HyperOS 3.0.2.0, Android 16</p></td><td  ><p>HyperOS 3.0.2.0, Android 16</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Chipset</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, 3nm</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite, 3nm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>12GB/16GB LPDDR5X</p></td><td  ><p>12GB LPDDR5X</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB/512GB UFS 4.1</p></td><td  ><p>256GB/512GB UFS 4.1</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear camera 1</p></td><td  ><p>50MP f/1.6 Light Fusion 950, 1/1.31-inch sensor, OIS</p></td><td  ><p>50MP f/1.6 Light Fusion 800 OmniVision OVX8000, 1/1.55-inch sensor, OIS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear camera 2</p></td><td  ><p>50MP f/3.0 telephoto, 5x optical zoom, OIS</p></td><td  ><p>50MP f/2.2 telephoto, 2.2x optical zoom</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear camera 3</p></td><td  ><p>50MP f/2.4 wide-angle lens</p></td><td  ><p>8MP wide-angle lens</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Front camera</p></td><td  ><p>32MP f/2.0</p></td><td  ><p>20MP f/2.0</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ingress protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP68 dust and water resistance</p></td><td  ><p>IP68 dust and water resistance</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6.0, global 5G bands, NFC, dual-band GPS </p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, global 5G bands, NFC, dual-band GPS </p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Security</p></td><td  ><p>Ultrasonic in-screen sensor</p></td><td  ><p>Ultrasonic in-screen sensor</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Audio</p></td><td  ><p>USB-C, 2.1 stereo sound with subwoofer, Sound by Bose</p></td><td  ><p>USB-C, stereo sound, Sound by Bose</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>6500mAh, 100W charging, 50W wireless charging</p></td><td  ><p>6210mAh, 100W charging</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>163.33 x 77.82 x 7.9, 220g</p></td><td  ><p>157.49 x 75.25 x 8.0, 199g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Denim Blue, Black</p></td><td  ><p>Titanium Silver, Blue, Black</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-poco-f8-ultra-design"><span>POCO F8 Ultra: Design</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4901px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.34%;"><img id="Y8GPUuRGuXuRsVSQyeZxTN" name="POCO F8 Ultra" alt="POCO F8 Ultra review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Y8GPUuRGuXuRsVSQyeZxTN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4901" height="2761" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>POCO caters its products to a younger audience, so it's no wonder that the brand constantly refreshes its design.

This is a bigger deal in my use case, and I noticed the difference against the F7 Ultra in this area. I'm just glad that POCO is joining BBK brands in bringing this feature to its devices.</p><p>What I also like about the device is that it gets identical stereo channels — similar to Xiaomi phones from several years ago — and the sound quality is pretty great in its own right.

Now, this isn't something unique to the F8 Ultra, but affecting all phones powered by Qualcomm this year. Given that the chipset runs hotter, it's inevitable that the phone gets hot during extended gaming sessions. It gets uncomfortable to hold in such scenarios, and there is noticeable throttling when you push the phone to your limits, but I see it as a good thing, because otherwise, it would heat up so much that you couldn't even hold it.</p><p>On that note, I wasn't able to run any 3DMark stress tests on the device as I got a "Device Overheated" halfway through, and the F8 Ultra basically shut down after that. That said, this was only an issue when tunning synthetic workloads, and it didn't prove to be a problem in regular gaming situations.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4737px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="aJSEa2WdjijSmCVcXPyjzM" name="POCO F8 Ultra" alt="POCO F8 Ultra review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aJSEa2WdjijSmCVcXPyjzM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4737" height="2668" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Elsewhere, you get the usual connectivity options: Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6.0, a decent selection of 5G bands (that varies by region), eSIM connectivity, NFC (again, in select markets), and a good vibration motor. I didn't see any issues while making calls or connecting to my home network, nor while connecting a host of accessories over Bluetooth.</p><p>The F8 Ultra comes with a 6,500mAh battery, and while that's a considerable increase over its predecessor, it isn't quite as large as some of the other phones I used in recent weeks, notably the Find X9 Pro and its monstrous 7,500mAh battery that lasts two days. Even then, the F8 Ultra manages to last a day and a half comfortably, and with heavy use, I still got a day's worth without having to worry about the battery running out.</p><p>The phone has 100W charging, but the biggest issue with this is that POCO doesn't include a charger in the box. That's annoying to say the least, but as I had a 120W Xiaomi charger on hand, I used that with the device.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-poco-f8-ultra-cameras"><span>POCO F8 Ultra: Cameras</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="JBtd74fb5SbonCZTK9KeNN" name="POCO F8 Ultra" alt="POCO F8 Ultra review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JBtd74fb5SbonCZTK9KeNN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>POCO is using a trio of 50MP cameras on the F8 Ultra, with the main lens once again made by OmniVision, this time the OV50M. The 50MP f/1.7 lens has OIS, and POCO dubs this the Light Fusion 950 module. It's joined by a 50MP OmniVision OVX9500 wide-angle lens, and POCO is once again using the 50MP Samsung JN5 telephoto with OIS, going up to 5x optical zoom.</p><p>The zoom lens does a better job this time around, and I like the quality of shots it delivers at 5x. However, I would have preferred a 3x zoom factor, as that is what I got used to on most phones, and not having that proved to be a limitation — particularly when taking portrait shots. You get 4K60 video on all the sensors, but the video quality isn't quite as noteworthy as the Find X9 Pro or Vivo X300 Pro.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div

Colors tend to be a little saturated at times, but it isn't anywhere as exaggerated as what you get on Samsung phones, and overall, I like the tuning of the cameras this generation.</p><p>The wide-angle lens is pretty good too, even though it has an 18mm focal length instead of the usual 14mm that you get with most other phones. With the main lens at 23mm, the area covered by the wide-angle isn't that much more. Anyway, the lens itself is great in daylight situations, and it held up much better than I imagined in low-light scenarios with little to no artificial light.</p><div class="inlinegallery

Having to use the tele lens as a portrait shooter is annoying as a result, but it's a minor inconvenience.</p><p>Overall, the F8 Ultra has the best camera system that POCO has delivered by a long way.

There isn't a whole lot new with the UI in general, but to POCO's credit, the phone is optimized to take advantage of the hardware.</p><p>While other Chinese manufacturers are emulating iOS 26, leading to UI designs with plenty of translucent effects, Xiaomi hasn't seen the need to do so with its software. It's admirable that Xiaomi is continuing to provide a familiar UI, but it has been clear for a while that its software needs an overhaul, but the brand doesn't seem to get the message.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="XYnYQVfqDyJvdWxnhAxrXN" name="POCO F8 Ultra" alt="POCO F8 Ultra review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XYnYQVfqDyJvdWxnhAxrXN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The result is that the software on the F8 Ultra doesn't feel quite as modern as its Chinese rivals. Don't get me wrong, you still get plenty of useful features, and there's a lot I like about Xiaomi's software. It's just that it badly needs a visual overhaul, and Xiaomi continues to drag its feet.</p><p>On that note, the F8 Ultra will get four Android OS updates, but given Xiaomi's inability to roll these out on time, you'll have to wait quite a bit to get your hands on future Android releases.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-poco-f8-ultra-the-alternatives"><span>POCO F8 Ultra: The alternatives</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5030px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="Ui8kXS5HDi7UrBVJ2YHY7N" name="POCO F8 Ultra" alt="POCO F8 Ultra review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ui8kXS5HDi7UrBVJ2YHY7N.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5030" height="2833" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Redmagic 11 Pro follows a similar ethos as the F8 Ultra, delivering the best possible hardware. The 11 Pro isn't billed as an all-rounder, but it is the fastest gaming phone I tested, and it gets liquid cooling as well, which is just plain cool. I like the design of the 11 Pro better, and it lasts longer too. But there's no doubt that the F8 Ultra has much better cameras.</p><p>Another alternative is the iQOO 15. I tested the phone alongside the F8 Ultra, and found it to be just as good. I prefer iQOO's software to that of the POCO, and the iQOO 15 has much better battery life. The F8 Ultra has a slender edge with the cameras, and it should undercut the iQOO 15 to a meaningful degree.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-poco-f8-ultra-should-you-buy-it"><span>POCO F8 Ultra: Should you buy it?</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="yj7sw6A2yxUkJPmnkDt8DN" name="POCO F8 Ultra" alt="POCO F8 Ultra review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yj7sw6A2yxUkJPmnkDt8DN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>You should buy this if: </strong></p><ul><li>You want the best phone internals money can buy</li><li>You need a phone with great battery life and fast charging</li><li>You want a gaming phone that will last several years</li><li>You want good cameras</li></ul><p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if: </strong></p><ul><li>You need clean software with timely updates</li></ul><p>Although the F8 Ultra is launching just eight months after its predecessor, it comes with meaningful upgrades. The cameras take better photos, and the addition of a 5x lens gives the phone greater versatility. The design itself is cleaner this time around, and I really like the denim finish — I'd like to see this make its way to Xiaomi's global phones at some point.</p><p>The panel may be seen as a downgrade, but that isn't actually the case in daily use, and it has better color vibrancy and gets brighter. The phone isn't short on power, and if anything, the lack of console-quality games on Android is the limiting factor in this area. I like that there's a bigger battery, and even on travel days, I had no issues getting the phone to last well over a day.</p><p>Overall, I think the F8 Ultra is one of the best phones to buy if you want flagship-tier internals but don't want to shell out in excess of $1,000. While cameras have always been the biggest drawback in the past, that is no longer an issue, and the F8 Ultra is an astonishingly good all-rounder. Basically, this is the best phone you can get in the vicinity of $700.</p> ]]></dc:content>

During the event, Qualcomm also teased a new flagship-level chipset meant to complement the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, branded as the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 (without the Elite name).</p><p>The Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 sits slightly below the Elite version but is still a flagship processor, and it is now officially here.</p><p>Qualcomm says the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 will bring "flagship-level performance" to a "wider range of premium smartphones." The chipset will target users who want top-tier performance for gaming, video editing, and advanced AI features.</p><h2 id="a-closer-look-at-qualcomm-s-slightly-less-premium-snapdragon-8-gen-5-2">A closer look at Qualcomm's slightly less-premium Snapdragon 8 Gen 5</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GxHKx6aSzpeJzsr8mkNv8S" name="snapdragon-8-gen-5-key-specs" alt="Key specifications of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 chipset" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GxHKx6aSzpeJzsr8mkNv8S.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1280" height="720" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In terms of technical specifications, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 is based on TSMC's 3 nm N3P process, the same as the flagship Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5. It even features the same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/qualcomm/qualcomms-elite-branding-should-stay-exclusive-to-oryon-based-chips">Oryon CPU</a> cores, although it is clocked slightly lower at 3.8 GHz. Qualcomm claims up to 36% improved performance and 42% better power efficiency compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a>.</p><p>GPU improvements are at around 11%, but power efficiency is up by 28% compared to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, which should result in improved graphics performance while using less power.</p><p>AI performance gains, however, are much larger, with Qualcomm claiming up to a 46% improvement over the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. This should deliver much-improved performance for on-device AI tasks, with Qualcomm saying the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 will also enable agentic AI assistants to deliver context-aware interactions and personalized suggestions.</p><p>Overall, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 should offer near top-tier Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 performance for more price-conscious flagship phones. The first devices featuring the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 are expected soon from brands including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-confirms-us-launch-for-15r-unveils-first-stylus-for-budget-tablet-line">OnePlus</a>, Vivo, Motorola, and iQOO, with new models "launching in the coming weeks."</p> ]]></dc:content>

While the phone has its share of detractors, I enjoy using it, and although the battery life and cameras aren't as good as my Vivo X300 Pro or Find X9 Pro, the software is what makes me continue to use the Pixel 10 Pro XL.</p><p>The Pixel 10 Pro XL has the best software of any Android phone, and the clean interface with dozens of meaningful extras makes a difference in regular use. While I don't like AI features, Google managed to deliver features that you'll end up using, and the phone itself is much better than previous years.</p><p>What isn't as good is the pricing; the Pixel 10 Pro XL debuted at $1,199, and if recent DRAM pricing trends are any indication, next year's phones will be costlier — making the current holiday deals that much more relevant. The Pixel 10 Pro XL is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0FFTPPFMZ/">now down to $899</a>, a $300 discount that makes it much more enticing.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="4c52cf28-0b2a-49a8-aa30-6637d3dfe304" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="The Pixel 10 Pro XL has a $300 discount right now, making it a much better deal if you're looking to upgrade.

The Pixel 10 Pro XL nails the basics, and the combination of design, AI-assisted software features, and reliable cameras make it one of the best phones around.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You want a gaming phone. While the Pixel 10 Pro XL gets a lot right, it still isn't quite as powerful as its immediate rivals.</p><p>I outlined all the reasons why I like the Pixel 10 Pro XL; I've always enjoyed using Google's phones, and while I get over a hundred phones any given year, I switch to the current-gen Pixel after I'm done with the review cycle. A lot of that has to do with the software — I just enjoy Google's software, and it caters to what I need in a phone.</p><p>That isn't to say that the Pixel 10 Pro XL is a bad phone. If anything, this is easily the best phone from Google yet, and it addresses a lot of the lingering issues that have plagued its predecessors. With the Pixel 10 Pro XL, there really aren't many glaring issues, and while it isn't designed to be a gaming phone, it has better power than previous generations, and it isn't hobbled in this regard.</p><p>The cameras are outstanding, and they take great photos in any situation. While I like the Vivo X300 Pro, I'll admit that the Pixel 10 Pro XL has the most consistent cameras of any phone around, and that alone is a big deal.</p><p>Basically, this is a great phone, and a $300 discount means it isn't as outrageously costly now. If you're mulling a new phone but haven't decided yet, you should consider <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0FFTPPFMZ/">getting the Pixel 10 Pro XL while it's still at $899</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

And right now, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-20000mAh-Portable-Charger-Charging/dp/B0DSPXHFBM">it is down to $65</a>, making it a terrific deal.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="0a992072-f78d-4168-934a-5c44958015d0" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="I rely on this power bank while traveling, and it is a great choice thanks to its vertical design, decent-sized 20,000mAh battery, and the fact that it gets a built-in cable." data-dimension48="I rely on this power bank while traveling, and it is a great choice thanks to its vertical design, decent-sized 20,000mAh battery, and the fact that it gets a built-in cable." data-dimension25="$65.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-20000mAh-Portable-Charger-Charging/dp/B0DSPXHFBM" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1168px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:110.02%;"><img id="tYPZbJYyJ9GHmtNbNZpL6" name="UGREEN Nexode 20000mAh 165W Power Bank" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tYPZbJYyJ9GHmtNbNZpL6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1168" height="1285" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>I rely on this power bank while traveling, and it is a great choice thanks to its vertical design, decent-sized 20,000mAh battery, and the fact that it gets a built-in cable. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-20000mAh-Portable-Charger-Charging/dp/B0DSPXHFBM" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="0a992072-f78d-4168-934a-5c44958015d0" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="I rely on this power bank while traveling, and it is a great choice thanks to its vertical design, decent-sized 20,000mAh battery, and the fact that it gets a built-in cable." data-dimension48="I rely on this power bank while traveling, and it is a great choice thanks to its vertical design, decent-sized 20,000mAh battery, and the fact that it gets a built-in cable." data-dimension25="$65.99">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if:</strong> You need a reliable power bank with 100W USB PD charging out of the USB-C ports.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You need 140W power, or a bigger battery.</p><p>The Nexode power bank nails the basics; it has a durable design, and even after traveling to several countries with the power bank, I didn't see any issues with reliability.

Other than that, I like that it doesn't take up much room; I take way too much tech while traveling, and having a 20,000mAh power bank that's smaller is a big deal in itself.</p><p>The power bank uses the USB PD protocol, with a single port doing up to 100W. This is adequate when I need to charge my phone or accessories while traveling. Coming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-20000mAh-Portable-Charger-Charging/dp/B0DSPXHFBM">in at $65</a>, it's a decent value as well right now.</p> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Bluetooth speakers fill a niche spot in the audio market, and deciding whether you really need one can be tricky. The best ones are noticeably better than listening to music straight from your Android phone, but usually worse than premium earbuds or headphones. Forget putting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-do-waterproof-dustproof-rugged-ip-rating-numbers-mean">portable Bluetooth speakers</a> up against dedicated in-home audio setups, because they'll lose every single time.</p><p>So, is there a reason to buy high-priced Bluetooth speakers, such as the Bose SoundLink Micro 2? This speaker, and those in its category, are inherently limited by their size. The Bose SoundLink Micro 2's footprint is a four-inch square, and while larger than its predecessor, it can only fit a small 5W audio driver as a result. Volume won't be competitive with larger speakers, but that isn't a dealbreaker for me.</p><p>Instead, I've appreciated that Bose valued clarity and depth over pure loudness, because it helps the SoundLink Micro 2 sound better than most competitors in its size class. The high $129 retail price is steep for something of this caliber, but there's a certain kind of music listener who will love it. Oh, and it's already on sale for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/black-friday">Black Friday</a>, only a few months post-launch.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="7849024f-fa2c-4cc0-a57e-f5b9f9bc91b3" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Bose SoundLink Micro 2:" data-dimension48="Bose SoundLink Micro 2:" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/bose-soundlink-micro-portable-bluetooth-speaker-2nd-gen-black/J7C5V6TVKJ/sku/6641221" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="7VudE2xFqCeRrbir5RxH4J" name="Bose-SoundLink-Micro-Gen2" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7VudE2xFqCeRrbir5RxH4J.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Bose SoundLink Micro 2:</strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/bose-soundlink-micro-portable-bluetooth-speaker-2nd-gen-black/J7C5V6TVKJ/sku/6641221" target="_blank" data-dimension112="7849024f-fa2c-4cc0-a57e-f5b9f9bc91b3" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Bose SoundLink Micro 2:" data-dimension48="Bose SoundLink Micro 2:" data-dimension25=""> <del>was $129.00</del> <strong>now $109.00</strong> <strong>at Best Buy</strong></a></p><p>Bose's SoundLink Micro 2 is still tiny, but packs a bigger punch.

This speaker handles both eloquently. The speaker's body is covered in a tough rubber that protects the shiny metal speaker grille underneath. While there are oversights, like no plug for the USB-C port, the SoundLink Micro 2 earns an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-do-waterproof-dustproof-rugged-ip-rating-numbers-mean">IP67 water- and dust-resistance rating</a>.</p><p>That IP67 certification means the SoundLink Micro 2 can handle submersion in up to one meter of water at normal pressure for half an hour, at least when it leaves the factory. We wouldn't recommend using it <em>in</em> the water, but it should survive beach or pool duty just fine. Those are near-perfect applications for the SoundLink Micro 2 — vacations, hikes, parties, and pool days are all great uses for a wireless speaker this durable.</p><p>However, I'd be wary of sand, as there are a lot of places for particles to get trapped, even if the internals are dustproof.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="dqEE4JPpXzrdPK89oeg7wk" name="Bose-SoundLink-Micro-2-4" alt="The Bose SoundLink Micro 2 in black showing the back strap." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dqEE4JPpXzrdPK89oeg7wk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It has a built-in strap that's luckily user-replaceable and removable. This is arguably the SoundLink Micro 2's best feature. It's perfect for securing the speaker to a bag or a set of handlebars, and it'd make a great addition to a bike or scooter setup. At just 320 grams, it's a lightweight option.</p><p>Compared to the inbuilt carabiner found on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/this-pre-black-friday-jbl-clip-5-deal-slaps">JBL Clip 5</a>, I'd say Bose's implementation is better. You can still slide your own carabiner into the SoundLink Micro 2 strap, but the JBL Clip 5 can't be secured as well as the Bose speaker.</p><p>Volume isn't a strength of any speaker in this size class, but the level of detail and depth you get from the Bose SoundLink Micro 2 is impressive. It sounds best when you listen head-on, and you'll hear a surprising amount of bass considering the small form factor. There isn't the annoying distortion you hear at high volumes, either. It's clear that you get what you pay for with the SoundLink Micro 2 — it's slightly louder than competitors but <em>way</em> better-sounding.</p><h2 id="what-i-don-t-love-about-the-bose-soundlink-micro-2-2">What I don't love about the Bose SoundLink Micro 2</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BXsf9YjuRhxsb4iZWqqQsk" name="Bose-SoundLink-Micro-2-5" alt="The Bose SoundLink Micro 2 in black showing the power button and USB-C port." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BXsf9YjuRhxsb4iZWqqQsk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I do have a few complaints, starting with the strap. It's <em>almost </em>perfect, but I wish it were a bit longer so you can strap the Bose SoundLink Micro 2 to more things. As a runner, I strangely wish I could just strap it to my arm for group workouts. Or, perhaps a longer strap could be used to attach the SoundLink Micro 2 to a water bottle — the possibilities are endless. Unfortunately, none of these use cases is possible with the current length.</p><p>Bose also chose to remove the microphone from the Bose SoundLink Micro 2 (the original SoundLink Micro had one). This isn't an issue at all for me, and it probably won't be for you, unless you use your Bluetooth speaker for two-way calls. I'm sure there are some people out there who do, and the SoundLink Micro 2 won't work.</p><h2 id="who-should-buy-the-bose-soundlink-micro-2-2">Who should buy the Bose SoundLink Micro 2?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2GNpWM9PEfQsX3jKMh855m" name="Bose-SoundLink-Micro-2-8" alt="The Bose SoundLink Micro 2 in black next to a JBL Clip and a Bose SoundLink Plus." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2GNpWM9PEfQsX3jKMh855m.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There aren't many times I'd use the Bose SoundLink Micro 2 in place of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/everyone-needs-3-pairs-of-wireless-headphones-here-are-my-picks">my other audio products</a>, but it's the best option when durability, water-resistance, and portability are top of mind.

Entering the mid-range segment, the Chinese company states its devices feature "flagship-class" photography, live capture capabilities, and more. The Honor 500 series kicks off with its base model, which boasts a 6.5-inch display with a thin 1.05mm bezel on a "slim" frame (7.75mm). Internally, the Honor 500 features the Qualcomm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/the-new-snapdragon-8s-gen-4-aims-to-make-premium-features-a-bit-more-accessible">Snapdragon 8s Gen 4</a> SoC, a chip that sought to bring flagship-quality strength and features to more price-conscious, mid-range phones.</p><p>Honor states that its base 500 model offers "a wide range of eye protection features, helping to alleviate discomfort from natural light fluctuation, flicker, brightness, and more." The company is also leaning into its artificial intelligence software for features like AI Defocus Display and AI Motion Sickness.</p><p>Though a thin phone, it's the back of the Honor 500 series that's giving us fruity Apple vibes. The Honor 500 features a horizontal camera array with rounded corners, and its lenses are beside each other. From the color of the phone (blue, pink, silver, and black) to the camera visor, it's clear that Honor's inspiration was Apple's iPhone Air. This visor contains a 200MP main lens and a 12MP ultra-wide camera.</p><p>Honor adds that the 500 was created with an "integrated cold-carved unibody design, in which the camera module and rear glass are crafted as a single seamless piece." The MagicOS 10 software and Honor's "tiered" AI button will greet users out of the box. What's not so mid-range is the Honor 500's battery, which sits at 8,000mAh with 80W wired charging, 27W wired reverse charging, and 50W wireless support.</p><p>The Honor 500 has launched in China this week for 2699 RMB (~$380). There's no word on whether we'll see this device arrive in other markets.</p><h2 id="500-pro-ventures-more-toward-flagship-2">500 Pro ventures more toward "flagship"</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:438px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:136.99%;"><img id="6DdyN4q6NqJyUvGQTiX22G" name="honor-500-series-info" alt="The Honor 500 series launches in China with a soft Apple iPhone Air design that features a camera visor with dual cameras for the base model and three cameras for the Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6DdyN4q6NqJyUvGQTiX22G.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="438" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Honor / Weibo)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The other side of the pie is the Honor 500 Pro, which the press release states continues the 6.5-inch display with thin bezels on a thin frame. Internally, the 500 Pro swaps the mid-range-focused chip for the 2024 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> flagship SoC. Chinese consumers will find the same overall iPhone Air-like design for the 500 Pro; however, its camera array features an additional lens: a 50MP telephoto lens.</p><p>Honor states this lens supports its in-house SOIS stabilization system for "crispy" and "steady" shots during fast-paced action. The 500 Pro (base 500, too) features 4K-to-Live conversion. Honor says this helps users turn their 4K-recorded videos into "4K Live clips" for social media purposes.</p><p>An 8,000mAh battery with the same charging specs is listed for the 500 Pro, too. What's more, Honor says its 500 Pro is much more equipped to handle data, reception, and more.

I also don’t like to push people to buy something for the sake of it, but I can’t express to you how much I love my Oura Ring 4.</p><p>It’s been 3 years since I permanently switched over to wearing a smart ring. Android Central’s Managing Editor, Derrek Lee, introduced me to Oura and said it might be a good option to try.</p><p>At the time, I was exclusively wearing a smartwatch, but I was feeling incredibly burnt out with all the notifications and constantly feeling like I needed to hit my fitness goals. So I actively decided it was time to take my watch off and not worry about any of those stats.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="Vhk69zDctzNwxrsBGb6gLX" name="Oura-Ring-4-Ceramic-08" alt="Wearing the Oura Ring 4 Ceramic" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Vhk69zDctzNwxrsBGb6gLX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Something was missing, though, and that’s when I got the Oura Ring 3 and learned that I do like notifications, but I personally like something that monitors me passively. And I think that’s exactly why you should get the Oura Ring 4.</p><p>Some of my favourite things about the Ring 4 are that it is much thinner than the Ring 3, it takes less time to charge, and I don’t have to charge it as often. I like that I wake up every morning and I can see how I’ve slept and whether my body is ready (or not) for the day. And most importantly, I like tracking my menstrual cycle and can exactly pinpoint all of my cycles.</p><p>And while I’m still seeing stats about my body, I’m not actively getting pinged throughout the day telling me to do things. I like knowing how my body has recovered from stress, or how my heart health is doing.</p><p>So this Black Friday, if you’re thinking about living a softer but you want to make sure that you are getting the right information about your health, then I recommend getting the Oura Ring 4.</p><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>major discounts on Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>official Black Friday discounts on tablets, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></a></li></ul><h2 id="when-is-black-friday-2025-2">When is Black Friday 2025?</h2><p>Black Friday will occur on November 28th this year.

Zeighami has been a part of the VR industry for a long time, working as the Technical Product Manager at Within, the company behind the ever-popular workout app Supernatural, back in 2017, and later going on to work for several other VR companies to this day.</p><p>In addition to this revelation of Meta's purported new naming convention, Zeighami backed up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/the-quest-4-might-slip-to-2027-but-meta-could-unveil-a-lighter-model-next-year-instead">previous rumors</a> about the headset's specs and revealed several new ones. That upgraded display is said to feature more pixels per degree (PPD) than the Quest 3, but not quite as high-res as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-galaxy-xr">Galaxy XR</a> or Apple Vision Pro.</p><p>PPD is a measurement of how many pixels are displayed within one degree of a viewer's field of view (FOV). This is an important measurement because a higher resolution panel may not necessarily equate to better visuals if the "wrong" lenses are used. The Holocake 2 prototype, pictured above, featured an ultra-high 55 PPD (60 PPD is considered "retina resolution") as well as a super slim profile.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ultimate-meta-quest-3-and-3s-starter-kit-2025"><strong>The Ultimate Meta Quest 3 and 3S Starter Kit: 12 high-tech accessories for a peak VR experience</strong></a></li></ul><p>Enjoy our content?

For comparison, the compute portion <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/steam-frame-steam-deck-meta-quest-3">of the Valve Steam Frame</a> weighs just 190g, while a Meta Quest 3 (with no detachable compute components) weighs 515g. Other minimalist premium VR headsets like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.bigscreenvr.com/products/bigscreen-beyond-2">Bigscreen Beyond 2</a> weigh just 107g by offsetting tracking and compute to a connected PC, something Meta could hope to replicate with a separate puck.</p><p>Zeighami also notes that eye and face tracking will come standard on Meta's next headset, mirroring that of the Galaxy XR, Apple Vision Pro, and the Meta Quest Pro. The kicker is that this new headset will reportedly only cost $800, a massive differentiator from the $1500 Quest Pro, $1800 Galaxy XR, and $3500 Apple Vision Pro.</p><p>A recent Instagram AMA from Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Lunayian/status/1993123948645826958?s=20">via Luna on X</a>) seems to back up the idea that Meta is looking to launch a new lighter headset by "taking the wins from each generation...and pour it into lightness and smallness." James Cameron <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/james-cameron-thinks-vr-is-definitive-way-to-watch-his-movies">also made similar comments</a> back at Meta Connect in September this year, furthering the idea that we should expect a new supremely small and light standalone XR headset from Meta in 2026.</p> ]]></dc:content>

So when you come across a deal like seeing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CXGMPLWK"><strong>Razer Kishi Ultra for 50% off</strong></a> for Black Friday, it makes you wonder whether you need to add another controller to the arsenal.</p><p>When it comes to gaming, Razer is one company that practically everyone knows about, and for good reason. The company offers a wide variety of products, but it only recently started taking the mobile gaming scene a bit more seriously, and it started with the Kishi Ultra.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="409e3f4d-e758-4c7b-9b33-519402dc988f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Razer Kishi Ultra: $149.99" data-dimension48="Razer Kishi Ultra: $149.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CXGMPLWK" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="B5ReuctET95VW8vYqTNZ66" name="razer-kishi-ultra-square-render.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B5ReuctET95VW8vYqTNZ66.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Razer Kishi Ultra: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CXGMPLWK" data-dimension112="409e3f4d-e758-4c7b-9b33-519402dc988f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Razer Kishi Ultra: $149.99" data-dimension48="Razer Kishi Ultra: $149.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$149.99</del> <strong>$79.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>This controller packs practically all of the bells and whistles one could want in a mobile controller.

Needless to say, I picked up the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/razer-kishi-ultra-launch">Kishi Ultra</a> for myself shortly after its release, and it's one that keeps making its way into my rotation of controllers.</p><p>More than anything else, it's because of the ergonomics, as the Kishi Ultra was designed to feel like a traditional controller, despite being designed for phones and tablets. The Ultra is just very comfortable to use for longer gaming sessions, a trait that is becoming increasingly difficult to find for someone with chronic wrist pain.</p><p>However, Razer also made sure to pack a bunch of extra features into the Kishi Ultra. These include things like the Sensa HD Haptics for better haptic feedback in supported games, along with the Chroma RGB, and we all know that having RGB gives you an edge while gaming.</p><p>But that's not all, as the Kishi Ultra will work well with larger devices like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> and some small tablets. It was designed to support up to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-ipad/i-finally-used-the-ipad-mini-and-im-obsessed">iPad Mini</a>, which features an 8.3-inch display, and this also makes it great to pair with foldable phones.</p><p>So even if you already have a controller that you enjoy and rely upon, I would at least recommend checking out the Kishi Ultra for yourself. You might just be surprised.</p><h2 id="black-friday-2025-quick-links-27">Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

But if all that static data felt a bit too passive, YouTube Music is flipping the script.</p><p>The 2025 Recap has started rolling out with a fresh design, smarter stats, and a brand-new AI chat tool that talks to you about your listening habits, as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/11/24/youtube-music-2025-recap/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>. For an app known for its almost predictable Recap experience, this year’s update feels like Google finally deciding to have fun.</p><p>Google swapped out the usual flurry of cards for a more narrative-style highlight reel, complete with cleaner transitions and more visual context around your top songs, moods, and artists. You still get the essentials, such as your most-played tracks, your listening benchmarks, and the guilty-pleasure loops you probably forgot about.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music">YouTube Music</a> also generates your Recap with month-by-month listening trends.

Google created an interactive recap assistant using the same technology as Gemini. You can ask questions like “Did I listen to more K-pop this year?” or “Which artist spiked in October?” Instead of scrolling through cards, you talk to your stats and get quick answers.</p><p>You also get share-ready AI-generated graphics from the chatbot's responses, which is Google’s way of making Recap a little more Instagram-friendly. The AI chat feature is available on Android and iOS, but full functionality seems to be rolling out in stages.</p><p>With the AI chat assistant now baked in, it wouldn’t be surprising to see YouTube Music <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-create-ai-generated-radio-stations-youtube-music">lean even harder into personalized recommendations</a> powered by your listening history.

Thanksgiving is just around the corner, and this is a deal you'd be thankful you spotted! The company has dropped the price of the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic-review"> Galaxy Watch 8 Classic </a>so low that it makes this premium watch an easy steal.

Alternatively, if you something to trade in, you can send it to Samsung and save up to $300.</p><p>One of the key features of the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic is the return of the physical rotating bezel for quick navigation of menus and notifications without touching the screen. It also comes built in with One UI 8, Gemini integration at its core, and a ton of new health and wellness metrics like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-tested-samsung-galaxy-watch-8-antioxidant-index-and-raised-score">Antioxidant index</a>.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="1bc2d1ed-697a-4da1-add0-e1cf1ec06c55" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$499" data-dimension48="$499" data-dimension25="$" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/watches/galaxy-watch8-classic/buy/galaxy-watch8-classic-46mm-black-wi-fi-bluetooth-sku-sm-l500nzkdxaa" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="5N3LwUsQ6bSCbGGnkuYuV6" name="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5N3LwUsQ6bSCbGGnkuYuV6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="2000" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Galaxy Watch 8 Classic:</strong> <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/watches/galaxy-watch8-classic/buy/galaxy-watch8-classic-46mm-black-wi-fi-bluetooth-sku-sm-l500nzkdxaa/" data-dimension112="1bc2d1ed-697a-4da1-add0-e1cf1ec06c55" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$499" data-dimension48="$499" data-dimension25="$"><del>$499</del> <strong>From $199 with trade-in | $399 without at Samsung</strong></a></p><p>The Galaxy Watch 8 Classic just hit its best price on Samsung, with up to $300 off with trade-in this Black Friday!

If you already own a Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 or the Ultra, this isn't a significant upgrade for you.</p><p>As for the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic's standout specs, it weighs about 63.5 grams and has a Sapphire Crystal display, making consumers' viewing experience much better.</p><p>The smartwatch gets a new "Quick Button" for "added convenience." The smartwatch arrives with a 445mAh battery, 2GB of memory, and 64GB of storage. The smartwatch gets the faster WearOS 6 out of the box, along with a whole host of new health features like the "Antioxidant Index," which measures carotenoid levels in the blood in just five seconds to help users make more informed lifestyle choices.</p><p>Other than that, the Bedtime Guidance feature will "measure your circadian rhythm" to help you identify the best time to sleep. Additionally, the Watch 8 Classic features "Vascular Load," designed to help users understand their stress levels on their vascular system during the night.</p><p>Samsung is sweetening the deal by offering up to $300 in instant trade-in credit, potentially lowering the watch's price to just $299 on its Wi-Fi-only variant. Additionally, the company is including a complimentary 6-month iFit membership with the purchase.</p><h2 id="more-black-friday-deals-quick-links-2">More Black Friday deals - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Sometimes it’s just that brands have confusing product tiers or groupings. Beats wanted to take some of the guesswork out of their line and has added one of their highly lauded earbuds under the banner of one of their best sellers, the Powerbeats Pros.</p><p>In September of 2025, Beats updated and rebranded their Beats Fit Pro to the new Powerbeats Fit.

They are incredibly comfortable for me, yet so locked in my ears that dynamic HIIT workouts don’t dislodge them or make me feel like I need to reseat them. In that regard, Beats has taken my experience to the next level!</p><p>First up, though subtle, Beats has made two highly impactful quality-of-life changes. The wingtips, which slide into and press against your ear’s concha to lock them in, have been refined and, according to Beats, are roughly 20% more flexible. I can’t tell you they are precisely that, but I can say they definitely feel more “bendy” than before.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="HjLc2coSg5qBMCaNgr3n3e" name="beats-powerbeats-fit-old-new-comparison3.JPG" alt="Beats Powerbeats Fit" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HjLc2coSg5qBMCaNgr3n3e.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="uU8g4KbkpbZnfzxmYyTyzd" name="beats-powerbeats-fit-old-new-comparison1.JPG" alt="Beats Powerbeats Fit" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uU8g4KbkpbZnfzxmYyTyzd.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="TyebG6axWN8E5hGnEqskDc" name="beats-powerbeats-fit-old-new-comparison-macro2.JPG" alt="Beats Powerbeats Fit" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TyebG6axWN8E5hGnEqskDc.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>And, comparing them side-by-side, you can see they’ve smoothed out what were once very angular edges along the entirety of the wingtips.

The previous model lacked official water-resistance certification, and it was too large for my jeans’ coin pockets, so it was often in my gym bag or backpack rather than on my person as my everyday carry earbuds. The Powerbeats Fit has changed that, so now they go with me everywhere in those little pants coin pockets.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="zyvyWCPR3tNvBXEE59qpGd" name="beats-powerbeats-fit-earbud-macro-no-tip.JPG" alt="Beats Powerbeats Fit" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zyvyWCPR3tNvBXEE59qpGd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I’ve used a lot of workout earbuds over the years I’ve been reviewing consumer audio products, and, aside from Jabra’s now-defunct line of excellent earbuds, Beats have been my choice for serious workouts. The active noise-cancellation on the Powerbeats Fit is respectable, allowing me to hone in on the mind/body connection during challenging lifts and really focus on technique, which is crucial as I work toward a 500lb deadlift.</p><p>That ANC won’t unseat <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/i-used-bose-quietcomfort-ultra-earbuds-gen-2-for-a-month">Bose’s QC Ultra (2nd Gen) earbuds</a>, but at $100 less, they do a good job of hushing low-frequency sounds and softening higher-frequency ambient noise. They’re also surprisingly capable of hushing sudden loud noises. With the music playing around 60%, the majority of sounds in the gym are drowned out—even the clank of plates. Push the volume a bit higher, and you’ll hear nothing but the music.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="zCq4VsceWg6ytpUofG7DAe" name="beats-powerbeats-fit-mics-porting.JPG" alt="Beats Powerbeats Fit" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zCq4VsceWg6ytpUofG7DAe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The transparency mode is excellent and sounds very natural. Not having to remove the earbuds when having brief conversations with folks I see at the gym regularly is something some folks may take for granted, but I wouldn’t buy any earbuds that don’t have as high-quality a transparency mode.</p><p>When I’m lying down on a flat bench, or enduring the hellish torture of burpees or mountain climbers, the Powerbeats Fit stay in place. On cardio days, even 45 minutes into a tempo run, or during interval sprints, my ears never feel fatigued by the wingtips, and the earbuds stay in pace.</p><p>All of that is well and good, but it all means little if the sound quality is trash. Fortunately, it is far from that.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="VJ9tx6oHLQdt3qZNeXEg6e" name="beats-powerbeats-fit-eartips.JPG" alt="Beats Powerbeats Fit" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VJ9tx6oHLQdt3qZNeXEg6e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Powerbeats Fit have bass-forward “V-curve” tuning with a bit of a scoop in the mids. Bass is tight, sub-bass has a deep, resonant rumble that is serious workout fuel, and there is satisfying clarity and sparkle in vocals and instrumentation.</p><p>Art Blakey’s “Moanin’” is one of my favorite tracks for testing how analytical or smooth a product’s high-frequency response plays. I’ve talked about the shrill horns on that track before. Those highs are bright and sparkle, right to the edge of fatigue. They don’t go over the edge, though some tracks, which are notoriously bright to the point of being fatiguing if you’re using analytical IEMs, may still be fatiguing for those with sensitivities to brighter treble frequencies. The brightness is never sibilant, though.</p><p>Listening to the title theme from the movie “Get Out,” “Sikiliza Kwa Wahenga,” the lyrics are still haunting, but the soundstage is more intimate. You get that same sense of intimacy when listening to Paul Simon’s “Diamonds on the Souls of Her Shoes,” but clarity and instrumentation are solid once you get past the song’s intro.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="78YVPx5HfVgS7Rxti6KbAd" name="beats-powerbeats-fit-old-new-comparison-macro.JPG" alt="Beats Powerbeats Fit" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/78YVPx5HfVgS7Rxti6KbAd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On tracks like Charles Mingus’ “Moanin’” or Michael Abel’s “Violin Duel,” the imaging is good, and though the soundstage isn’t expansive, you still get a good picture of the staging of each instrument.</p><p>One of the highlights of the Powerbeats Fit's listening experience is its digital signal processing (DSP). At varying volumes, music dynamics are robust and complete. Bass still has some weight, and treble clarity remains.</p><p>What won’t remain is the music when you take out one earbud. Or both! The wear detection, picked up by the optical sensors, is fast. Remove an earbud, and the music pauses instantly. Put it back in your ear, and the music picks back up where it left off, without delay.</p><h2 id="apple-vs-android-2">Apple vs. Android</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="ZjjeCfAMGxQ8JcHr8uQmte" name="beats-powerbeats-fit-beats-vs-airpods-comparison.JPG" alt="Beats Powerbeats Fit" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZjjeCfAMGxQ8JcHr8uQmte.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">From left to right: Powerbeats Pro 2, Beats Fit Pro, Powerbeats Fit, Airpods 4 ANC </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While Beats' most recent Powerbeats Pro 2 come equipped with Apple’s newer H2 chip, which enables features like an Adaptive Transparency mode when connected to Apple products, the Powerbeats Fit got the H1 chip.

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Alright, it's official: the best Black Friday streaming deal of the year has arrived, and it's honestly sent my jaw to the floor. From today through December 1st, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.disneyplus.com/"><strong>sign up for a year of the Disney Plus and Hulu Bundle and you'll only pay $4.99 per month for 12 months.</strong></a> Since the streaming bundle usually costs $12.99 per month, you're looking at a total discount of 61% on a year of content. It's as simple as that.</p><p>The only catch is that only new and returning subscribers are eligible, so if you're already using the service (or the popular Disney Plus with Hulu and ESPN bundle), then you might be out of luck. On the bright side, if you do sign up for the Black Friday deal, you can cancel at any time without any penalty. In other words, you'll get 30 days of complete access to two of the world's most popular streaming services, and it'll only cost you five bucks! Sounds like holiday magic to me.</p><h2 id="limited-black-friday-offer-get-disney-plus-and-hulu-for-just-5-per-month-2">Limited Black Friday offer: Get Disney Plus AND Hulu for just $5 per month</h2><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="ab94d235-c465-41fa-abb0-820d4ff48154" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Disney Plus and Hulu Bundle (with ads): $12.99" data-dimension48="Disney Plus and Hulu Bundle (with ads): $12.99" href="https://www.disneyplus.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:512px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="RP3iTSerhvF9RtgJNpSAgd" name="disney-plus-app-icon.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RP3iTSerhvF9RtgJNpSAgd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="512" height="512" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Disney Plus and Hulu Bundle (with ads): </strong><a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/" data-dimension112="ab94d235-c465-41fa-abb0-820d4ff48154" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Disney Plus and Hulu Bundle (with ads): $12.99" data-dimension48="Disney Plus and Hulu Bundle (with ads): $12.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$12.99</del> <strong>$4.99 per month for 12 months</strong></a></p><p>Just in time for <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/black-friday">Black Friday</a>, new and returning customers can score 61% off the price of one year of the Disney Bundle.
