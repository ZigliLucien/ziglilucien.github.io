The rumor adds that this could only concern the Pixel 10, 10 Pro, and 10 Pro XL. It seems the Pixel 10 Pro Fold will still continue to feature a physical SIM tray (if this is to be believed).</p><p>Blass states the alleged devices looking to drop the physical option will adopt "two active eSIM slots" for consumers.</p><p>Users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/TonY_GarciAa97/status/1953880105303912927">in the comments</a> started voicing their opinions and concerns, such as a few <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/_daytrade/status/1953873750421569651">who are dreading</a> this possibility for Google's Pixels. More than that, Blass responded to one user who asked whether or not this eSIM decision over physical will be region locked—specifically, the U.S. Blass <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/1953874593266962696">claims this complete move</a> from physical SIM to eSIM on the Pixel 10, 10 Pro, and 10 Pro XL points toward a U.S.-only decision.</p><h2 id="a-rumored-change-that-s-garnered-reactions-2">A (rumored) change that's garnered reactions</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qcz5qgF2N9bL7o9zBqS9M4" name="Google-Pixel-9-review-08.jpg" alt="The Pixel 9 with the Pixel Watch 2 on top" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qcz5qgF2N9bL7o9zBqS9M4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While this is only a rumor, as we've seen on X, users are already chipping in with their personal opinions. Even we here at Android Central aren't too keen on eSIM as a "forced" requirement; however, leaving it optional might be the better choice. Brady Snyder, an Android Central Contributor, states, "I have enough trouble with iPhones and eSIM." Snyder adds, "eSIM is not easier than using a physical SIM."</p><p>Our Managing Editor, Derrek Lee, threw his opinion into the ring, stating, "Only time I use it is when I'm traveling. Otherwise, I stick to physical."</p><p>There's a lot of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/difference-between-sim-and-esim-and-what-future-holds">push and pull surrounding the idea</a> (and reality) of using an eSIM. We're going to have to wait this out and see whether or not this rumor holds merit. In the meantime, we have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/another-pixel-10-series-leak-info-on-specifications-buds-2a">trove of Pixel 10 series specifications</a> that were recently alleged earlier today (Aug 8). One of the highlights was another mention of Google's "Pixelsnap," wireless charging accessory for its device that's ready to embrace Qi2.</p><p>We've seen rumors that the Pixel 10 series will feature magnets within the models to support Qi2 without a case (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-support-qi2-wireless-charging">unlike Samsung</a>), so this gives us more to think about.  Regardless, Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-store-pixel-10-teaser-officially-series-design-launch-promo">launch event</a> for these devices will take place on August 20, where we'll undoubtedly get the full picture about its potential eSIM future.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The tipster is alleging key details about the Pixel 10 Pro, 10 Pro XL, and the 10 Pro Fold. The images, which seem to have been ripped from Google's planned promo material, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10-pro-xl-large-and-in-charge-major-leak-weeks-before-launch">claim the Pixel 10 Pro XL</a> will feature a 6.8-inch Super Actua display. The battery can last ~24 hours or more with Pixelsnap wireless charging available.</p><p>It seems the RAM size for the 10 Pro XL is capped at 16GB, alongside Google's expected Tensor G5 SoC.</p><p>For the fun stuff, the tipster alleges the 10 Pro XL will feature 8K video recording capabilities and a 42MP selfie camera. The triple array on the back is rumored to consist of a 50MP wide lens, a 48MP ultrawide lens, and a 48MP telephoto with 100x zoom.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">pic.twitter.com/RRch0mJhyq<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1953839474548277327">August 8, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>Rumors state the Pixel 10 Pro mirrors the Pro XL quite closely, except for its display, which is 6.3 inches.</p><p>Down a tier, we have the base Pixel 10. The device is supposedly mirroring the 10 Pro with a 6.3-inch Super Actua display and the same ~24 hours or more battery life. However, the differences will reportedly lie in its RAM, as the Pixel 10 could only receive 12GB. The Pixel 10 has also been rumored <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10-alleged-prototype-surfaces-chinese-auction-site-spotted">to grab a third camera</a>, and we're seeing that here in these leaked images.</p><p>The Pixel 10 is supposedly preparing a 48MP wide lens, a 13MP ultrawide, and a 10.8MP telephoto with 20x zoom. Video capabilities drop to 4K, while its selfie camera sinks to 10.5MP, under the Pro and Pro XL.</p><h2 id="here-comes-the-fold-2">Here comes the Fold</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">pic.twitter.com/4KDT8WliVu<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1953839478105067650">August 8, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>The Pixel 10 Pro Fold couldn't escape the leak, as the tipster alleges it could see an 8-inch Super Actua Flex (internal) display and a 6.4-inch cover. Specifications are much lighter than the others; however, the image claims the 10 Pro Fold could see a 20x zoom capable lens on its rear array and 16GB RAM.</p><p>Keeping you going is said to be a battery that can last ~24 hours or more, likely depending on use.</p><p>Lastly, sneaking into things is the Pixel Buds 2a, which has sort of been silent these past few months. Rumors state these buds could feature ANC (active noise cancellation) and sit right under the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-review">Buds 2 Pro</a> with seven hours of battery life (if ANC is active).

There was some reported evidence that Google was working on its own selection of Qi2-certified accessories for the Pixel 10, dubbed "Pixelsnap." These would let users charge their device wirelessly, similar to Apple's MagSafe. However, the Pixel 10 series (if the rumors are believed) is suspected to have Qi2 magnets within the phones.</p><p>This means that, unlike Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-support-qi2-wireless-charging">Galaxy S25 series, which requires a case</a> with magnets, the Pixel 10 can be placed on a wireless charger without issue.</p><p>Back into the leaks, a recent Pixel render drop <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/alleged-promo-videos-of-the-pixel-10-series-leak-ahead-of-launch-this-month">showcased the designs</a> of the 10 series.

It appears the Pixel Watch 4's left-side slots are for mounting onto this dock so that it stays in place.</p><p>In theory, this new charging dock will keep the watch display visible while charging on a desk or nightstand, so you can quickly check its charging progress. It'll also be interesting to see if the Pixel Watch 4 attaches to this new dock more seamlessly than the Pixel Watch 3 did; some Watch 3 owners complained about the pin system being hard to attach.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="e3PYr2agAyyZbgGq7Ajey4" name="Pixel-Watch-renders-04" alt="Pixel Watch 4 renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e3PYr2agAyyZbgGq7Ajey4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks/ via 91mobiles)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If this leak is accurate, it'll be the third proprietary cable across four generations of Pixel Watches; the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-review">first Pixel Watch</a> used a magnetic cable before the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Watch 2</a> adopted pins.</p><p>While this will create more e-waste with now-useless cables, the leaked report suggests that this redesign makes the Pixel Watch 4 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/pixel-watch-4-could-finally-tackle-whats-been-holding-googles-wearables-back">easier to repair</a>, whereas the first three generations couldn't be taken apart for repair, only replaced with a new model.

We're curious if accessory makers will be able to make one that doesn't block off the charging pins but still offers the same level of protection.</p><p>It'll also be important to see how the Watch 4 charging speed changes; currently, the Pixel Watch 3 41mm takes 24 minutes to 50% or 60 minutes to 100%, while the Watch 3 45mm takes 28 and 80 minutes, respectively.</p><h2 id="waiting-on-qi-charging-for-android-watches-2">Waiting on Qi charging for Android watches</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="6KK5ZakhZd9zw3z8K2nKML" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-3-charging.jpeg" alt="The Google Pixel Watch 3, charging close to 100%" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6KK5ZakhZd9zw3z8K2nKML.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Smartwatch owners know the pain of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wearable-charging-is-an-unsolvable-mess">proprietary chargers</a>. You get one cable in the box, and if you lose it or leave it at home during a vacation, your watch suddenly becomes useless; the replacement is expensive and often isn't available on Amazon for faster shipping.</p><p>Why can't we demand a universal Qi charging standard for watches, like we have with smartphones and USB-C?

What immediately catches your eye is a banner that reads, "Google Pixel Watch 4 with Gemini." That seems to be the highlight of this leak, as another alleged promo image teases the AI model as a "quick AI assistant" for whatever you need.</p><p>The leak claims Gemini's presence on the Watch 4 will be there to give users "personalized help" and also provide "text suggestions" that "sound like you." Gemini will likely leverage some sort of "understanding" and context around how you usually speak to it to offer these AI-based suggestions. Or it could just be fancy talk—we'll see during launch.</p><p>Elsewhere, the Watch 4 is rumored to feature the Pixel Watch 3's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/loss-of-pulse-detection-is-finally-rolling-out-to-pixel-watch-3-users-in-the-us">Loss of Pulse</a> detection.</p><p>This was a feature that hit the Watch 3 in April <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/loss-of-pulse-detection-is-finally-rolling-out-to-pixel-watch-3-users-in-the-us">after the FDA cleared it</a> in February. If the Pixel Watch 3 doesn't detect your heartbeat for an extended period of time, it will alert emergency services on your behalf, explaining the situation. Additionally, there are supposedly "40 plus exercise modes," as well as the ability to build "custom run plans."</p><h2 id="a-look-into-the-pixel-watch-4-2">A look into the Pixel Watch 4</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">⌚️ pic.twitter.com/kWaR9yGpat<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1953628307678761047">August 8, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>The leaks also had something to say about the Pixel Watch 4's specifications. The supposed images reiterate what we've heard before about a 41mm and a 45mm variation for the device. However, we're getting a glimpse into its battery, which claims to sit at ~30 hours (41mm) and ~40 hours (45mm). The leaks state these estimations take into account the AOD (always-on display).</p><p>If true, this is already higher than what the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> offers. Last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_watch_3_specs?hl=en-US#:~:text=Power%20(Battery%20and%20Charging)">model delivers</a> "up to" 24 hours for both sizes with AOD active. With it off, users will likely go further with their watch.</p><p>The tipster also alleges a few health sensor capabilities, like ECG, breathing rate, and HRV.</p><p>As previously stated, we're just coming off the back of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/pixel-watch-4-is-center-stage-colors-design-renders-leaked">several leaked Pixel Watch 4 renders</a> that seemingly gave us our best look yet at it. While it's been rumored for months now that Google will keep the glass-domed design the same, the Watch 4's alleged renders hinted at thinner bezels for a larger screen. These leaks clued us into the potential colors for the 41mm, which could include Iris, Lemongrass, Porcelain, and Obsidian.</p><p>The 45mm has been rumored to provide Moonstone, Porcelain, and Obsidian. Those images from earlier this week didn't give us a look at the watch's supposed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/google-pixel-watch-4-leaked-charging-cable-dock-rumor">"side-mounted" charging</a>, as older rumors suggest the Watch 4 does not have its old charging pins on the back. The Made by Google event is slated for August 20.</p> ]]></dc:content>

To me, it's wild that people spend thousands of dollars on the latest and greatest tech only to skimp out on charging solutions. I spend real money on USB-C cables for this reason, getting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-cables-adapters">the best cords on the market</a>. On the other end of the spectrum, brands that think up unique ways to innovate the boring USB-C charger always catch my attention.</p><p>That's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/power-charging/heres-why-your-next-usb-c-cable-should-have-a-screen">why I've used a USB-C cable with a screen</a> for years, and it's also why I couldn't wait to try Satechi's new OntheGo USB-C lanyard charger. The concept is exactly what it sounds like — it's a lanyard that can hold your ID badges and access cards like usual, but it also doubles as a 1.5-meter-long braided USB-C cable with metal endcaps. Usually, I'd write something like this off as a gimmick, but this one can handle 60W fast-charging duty and even supports data transfer.</p><p>At only $30, it's a neat and useful gadget for the right person.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="snXskMdk7e9M5stVdX9Dsb" name="Satechi-USB-Lanyard-2" alt="The Satechi Lanyard USB-C cable." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/snXskMdk7e9M5stVdX9Dsb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The lanyard has a somewhat odd design that doubles-back on itself, so you actually have two cords hanging across your neck. If you can get past that look, you might love the Satechi OntheGo USB-C lanyard. Pull either end of the cord loops and you can extend the hidden charger to its full length. Then, pop off the aluminum end caps (which stay tethered to the lanyard) and you're off and charging.</p><h2 id="a-must-have-accessory-for-lanyard-wearers-2">A must-have accessory for lanyard wearers</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4vTRaZ5TYS4JUoBgcnxBAQ" name="Satechi-USB-Lanyard-3" alt="The Satechi Lanyard USB-C cable." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4vTRaZ5TYS4JUoBgcnxBAQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Believe it or not, the lanyard doesn't look too strange hanging from your neck. The braided cloth material and aluminum hardware look much more premium than the lanyards you commonly see around. Unfortunately, you can't hang the lanyard from your pocket or bag as well, simply because the cables are too heavy.</p><p>I think there's a purpose for this kind of unique charger for two reasons. First of all, it's not overpriced — $30 is about what you'd pay for a good 60W cable and lanyard separately. On top of that, there's value in having a hidden charger built into something you already carry with you. I can't count the number of times I've had a fully-charged laptop and a dead phone with no USB-C cable to fill the gap. Carrying something like the OntheGo USB-C lanyard cable would solve that pain point once and for all.</p><p>It'd be most useful for people who need to wear a lanyard daily anyway. When I was a student, I had to wear a school ID daily — it was a requirement. It would've been really cool to have a charger ready to go as part of my lanyard, making this a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/back-to-school-your-ultimate-shopping-guide">great back-to-school purchase</a>. If you have an access card for work, this lanyard could come in handy for that, too.</p><p>Personally, I'm going to use this for my Tesla keycard, so I have a backup for unlocking my car <em>and</em> charging up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">my favorite Android devices</a>. The Satechi OntheGo USB-C lanyard cable might not be for everyone, but I definitely want to see accessory brands keep coming out with unique offerings like this one.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="cf9d5dc8-c1ba-4e0c-bf56-d0f0edeaf868">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YiaR652CvhfLRREwKdYVA9.jpg' alt="The Satechi lanyard loop in a white product render."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Satechi OntheGo USB-C Lanyard</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>A lanyard with a twist</strong></em></p><p>Satechi's OntheGo USB-C lanyard cable will hold your cards and charge up your phone.

One user on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1ma6hpa/im_the_3rd_one_posting_this_for_this_month_pixel/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">Reddit</a>, earlier this month, reported their Pixel 6a caught fire overnight while charging. The phone was reportedly on a nightstand just 40cm away from where they were sleeping, and the fire even damaged nearby sheets and flooring. Despite having installed Google's mandatory fix, the battery still failed.</p><h2 id="the-pixel-6a-part-you-need-the-most-back-on-ifixit-s-shelves-2">The Pixel 6a part you need the most back on iFixit's shelves</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tUgsXBlJCxU" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Google has offered help in the form of free replacements for affected devices and, in some cases, $150 cash compensation. But for those living in regions without Google's repair support — or for anyone wanting to get the repair done right away — there's now a DIY option.</p><p>As spotted by a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1mjze8u/pixel_6a_users_impacted_by_the_battery_update/">Reddit</a> user (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-pixel-6a-battery-kits-finally-resurface-on-ifixit/">Android Police</a>), iFixit has restocked the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ifixit.com/products/google-pixel-6a-battery-genuine">battery replacement kits</a> for the Pixel 6a. For those unaware, iFixit offers genuine Pixel repair parts and sells them standalone for DIY repairs. The Pixel 6a battery had been out of stock, likely due to low demand and the battery issues, but iFixit now seems to have resolved this.</p><p>These kits include everything you need to replace the battery yourself, along with step-by-step <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Google+Pixel+6a+Battery+Replacement/152516">written instructions</a> and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUgsXBlJCxU">detailed YouTube tutorial</a> to guide you through the process.</p><p>I'd still recommend going to an official Google repair store to get your Pixel 6a fixed, but if that's not possible and you want to dive in yourself, you now can.</p> ]]></dc:content>

If you're looking for the latest-generation option, you may want to wait until the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10 series</a> release, which is slated for August 20.

Much of this is related to the design, an area where the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE struggles against its chief rival in the US.</p><p>It’s perfect if you want a no-frills flip phone, but if you want a phone that elicits emotion, the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE falls short. At a lower price than at launch, it could be a fantastic deal, as long as the Flip 6 isn’t also discounted.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-fe-price-and-availability"><span>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE: Price and availability</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2313px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TrjhzdR9CMBufJJ65cA22K" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-7-FE-review-Android-Central-7" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE in Black in the hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TrjhzdR9CMBufJJ65cA22K.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2313" height="1301" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE starts at $899.99 for the 128GB version, with the 256GB storage variant costing $60 more. However, at the time of writing, Samsung is currently still running its pre-order promotion, discounting the 256GB version to a lower price.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE is available in just two colors — Black and White. Unlike the Flip 6, there are no additional color options, nor any colors exclusive to Samsung’s direct sales channels like its online and physical stores.</p><p>The premise of the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE is that it’s affordable enough for MVNOs to offer it for free, or close to it. So far, Boost Mobile is the only one to do so, with the carrier offering up to $899 off the handset price with an unlimited data plan from $65 per month. The best part?

If the prices are identical, choose the Galaxy Z Flip 6 for its colors.</p><p>However, it's also wroth considering the Moto Razr 2025. This is one of my favorite phones right now as Motorola's approach to the Cover Screen is significantly better than Samsung, with the ability to run any app, a host of optimized panels inclduing games, and several tricks to take advantage of the form factor.</p><p>The Razr 2025 is $100 cheaper and available from all major carriers; it also comes in vibrant colors and has better battery and charging.

Plus, at $300 lower than the Flip 7, it’s a compelling offering. However, it is not as convincing when you consider the alternatives, such as the Galaxy Z Flip 6 or Razr 2025.</p><p>Overall, while the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE is a fairly confusing product, it’s a solid phone on its own but hampered by last year’s Galaxy Z Flip 6 and the excellent Galaxy Z Flip 7. Against the growing competition, the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE struggles to stand out even though it’s a good, if unspectacular, folding phone.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="a3b5c469-cc7a-469b-8e23-4479141da804">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RJwtppW9DAGqVEQUiZRVhP.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>A cheaper flip phone</strong></em></p><p>The Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE takes the best of the Flip 6 and brings a new chip and comes at a cheaper launch price.

There was a time when other brands like LG, HTC, and even Sony Xperia were part of the conversation. But most of these companies have either <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/its-official-lg-exiting-smartphone-business">exited the smartphone space</a> or stopped selling their devices in the U.S.</p><p>At one point, it even seemed like the end of the road for Sony, especially when the company began <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/sony/sony-outsourced-production-xperia-line-report">outsourcing Xperia smartphone production</a> to third-party manufacturers. However, it looks like Sony isn't done just yet.</p><p>During the financial results call this week in Japan, Sony CFO Lin Tao stated that the smartphone business is "an extremely important business for us" and that the company intends to "nurture" it (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://japan.cnet.com/article/35236485/">CNET Japan</a>).</p><h2 id="xperia-lives-on-at-least-according-to-sony-2">Xperia lives on, at least according to Sony</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="uaWeD3CqZPHaShuRSosMUX" name="sony-xperia-1-review-in-hand.jpg" alt="A Sony Xperia smartphone in hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uaWeD3CqZPHaShuRSosMUX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1536" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure><p>Tao emphasized that "communication technology" is a key area Sony has cultivated for a long time and that it wants to continue valuing its smartphone business.</p><p>This statement comes on the heels of a recent issue, where Sony had to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sony.jp/xperia/support/software/update/info/20250704_xperia1vii.html">recall units of the Xperia 1 VII</a> in Japan due to a shutdown bug. Tao opened the earnings call by saying, "We apologize for the huge inconvenience to our users," but also reiterated the company's continued focus on smartphones.</p><p>Since the issue first surfaced, the company has started replacing the affected Xperia 1 VII devices.</p><p>That said, Xperia smartphones have struggled, even in Sony's home market of Japan, where Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-imagination-studio-k-pop-collab-teasers">Pixel lineup has gained</a> significant traction. While Sony continues to offer features like a microSD card slot and a 3.5mm headphone jack, even in its latest flagship phones, the high price of Xperia flagships has been a major barrier for many buyers.</p><p>The company still sells select Xperia models in global markets like Europe, but they remain a rare sight.</p><p>So what does Tao's statement really mean? Well, your guess is as good as ours, but it does seem like Sony isn't giving up on smartphones just yet.</p> ]]></dc:content>

As for the Pixel 10 Pro Fold,  the alleged promo video zooms in on the hinge of the device and shows the inner display with thinner bezels, giving it a bit more screen space than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-vs-pixel-9-pro-fold">Pixel 9 Pro Fold. </a></p><p>Finally, the video of the supposed Pixel Watch 4 showcases the wearable in full.

With seconds to spare, I cleaned up my fingerprints, stashed the mystery man's belongings, and slowly opened the door to greet two officers who had weapons drawn on me.</p><p>Just 30 seconds later, I was pronounced innocent and allowed to go on my merry old way.

The game has over half a dozen levels, each with at least six different places to hide the mystery man Gus's corpse.</p><p>Despite what the subject matter might make you think, Hide the Corpse is a strangely family-friendly title that has no foul language, no violence (other than dragging a corpse around, I suppose), and little else that might trigger you to hide its existence in front of your kids.</p><p>That, of course, meant that my son and I spent hours laughing until we cried as we struggled to drag around Gus's insanely heavy corpse without running into the furniture in our real living room. Seriously, it's a hilariously good time that's guaranteed to make you laugh.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="obm7TPnxq3z2bjcxLAZqyY" name="hide-the-corpse-official-screenshot-01" alt="An official screenshot of Hide the Corpse for Meta Quest.

Even more so given that you only have four minutes to somehow bring him to a legit hiding spot and cram him into whatever dimensions said spot allows.</p><p>The intro level takes place in an apartment where you can hide Gus in strangely conspicuous places like the bathtub, the armoire, under the bed, and three other spots I don't want to ruin. You'd think the cops would find him in these places, but they're, thankfully, no Sherlock Holmes.</p><p>The goal is to just hide Gus's corpse from plain sight, a goal that becomes zanier and zanier as you progress through the levels. And I promise that you never realized how heavy a corpse could be in zero gravity until you get to the space level!</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="N6Ko5Ekyu38qQb9uC6Gw2Z" name="hide-the-corpse-official-screenshot-02" alt="An official screenshot of Hide the Corpse for Meta Quest.

The man somehow has several of his belongings scattered randomly in each level, including his comb, wallet, favorite record (this is 70s themed), driver's license, and a few other nicknacks. Each of these also needs to be hidden from plain sight to get the best score.</p><p>Oh, and don't forget to erase <em>every single one</em> of the fingerprints you left along the way. Seriously, those little blue fingerprints appear on anything you've touched, even if you didn't realize you'd touched it. It's an almost overwhelming amount of stuff to do in just four minutes, but it results in some gratifying gameplay in a short span.</p><p>When the time is up, either at the four-minute mark or when you open the door for the cops, you'll get graded on your performance. I'm not sure who grades someone on their ability to hide a corpse, but I hope I never run across them in real life.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="EuRAN3MDRSaRSNEww3bHsY" name="hide-the-corpse-official-screenshot-05" alt="An official screenshot of Hide the Corpse for Meta Quest showing the cops finding Gus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EuRAN3MDRSaRSNEww3bHsY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1440" height="810" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: HyperVR Games)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Once you find enough hiding spots in each level, you'll unlock a new level to play in. The scenarios are incredibly varied, ranging from the apartment you start in to the diner I spoke of earlier, a zero-gravity space station, an art museum, and more. The latest update in mid-July added a ton of new modifiers, including a <strong>heavier</strong> Gus and the ability to double the hiding time.</p><h2 id="alone-or-with-friends-it-s-a-riot-2">Alone or with friends, it's a riot</h2><p>While it's a single-player game, I found it to be the most fun when casting the gameplay to a TV while others in the room were watching. This <em>always</em> elicited people asking to try it and then spending multiple sessions in the game until someone pried the headset from their cold, not-dead hands. Definitely not dead. That only happens in the game.</p><p>It's the kind of zany, whimsical, unique fun that I love seeing from indie developers and a reminder of the late 90s and early 2000s era of gaming, where just about any theme or concept could make a game, no matter how surreal or ridiculous. Plus, at just $15, it's tough to say no to for a few fantastic hours of entertainment with friends and family.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Initially, the video explains the difficulties with removing the foldable's display, as Samsung introduced "heatless back panel removal," which caused too many issues. Thus, they were forced to gain entry near its cameras.</p><p>Removing the first battery is like moving through a maze—if the maze consisted of cables, screws (and more screws), and press connectors. The first battery, or rather, how Samsung implemented its removal process, was another gripe for iFixit. The video states the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on">Fold 7</a> features a thin pull tab. While this seems useful, iFixit states the tabs need "too much force" and could end up tearing.</p><p>More than that, if you're <em>too </em>forceful with the tab, you could bend the battery and risk ruining it.</p><p>After popping out the motherboard (yet another maze), iFixit gets to the camera. This is important as, according to iFixit, Samsung used a similar structure that it has other models. However, this means that a "full disassembly" of your device is required if something goes wrong with the camera.</p><h2 id="night-terrors-of-an-inner-screen-2">Night Terrors of an Inner Screen</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9KhF6emBjbE" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>The inner display of the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is probably going to be the worst nightmare any would-be repairperson would ever see. The teardown explains that the inner display is the more "fragile" aspect of this device, and that's only magnified when you consider Samsung's recent advancements to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-says-galaxy-z-fold-7-screen-decade-long-durability-report">help it reach 500,000 folds</a> (~10 years). The bezels are glued in, forcing iFixit to take uncomfortable means to remove them.</p><p>Moreover, the company states that you'd only ever remove the inner display if it's already damaged. This is because the inner screen is "sensitive to pressure and torsional rotation," so by the end of this teardown, the screen was more or less down and out.</p><p>Let's hope nothing goes wrong with your Fold 7 inner display, as iFixit states it would cost consumers a whopping $589 to replace it. You can check out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/9KhF6emBjbE">the rest of iFixit's teardown</a> on the Fold 7 and see what happens to warrant its 3 out of 10 repairability score.</p><h2 id="tedious-difficult-2">Tedious, difficult</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4527px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="2kWuw6f5DH4oNFJTE2JBtS" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review-19" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2kWuw6f5DH4oNFJTE2JBtS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4527" height="2546" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The mention of glued-down parts in the Galaxy Z Fold 7 teardown reminds us of why <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ifixit-samsung-partnership-concludes">iFixit cut ties with Samsung</a> last year. The company said it made this decision as its ideals over repairability for consumers didn't align with Samsung's. Its announcement said that Samsung's devices are "glued together."

After its initial debut in 2020, Samsung moved the series from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-galaxy-s20-series-wont-get-any-more-monthly-updates">monthly updates to quarterly</a> patches in 2024. This came in March last year, as Samsung started shifting away from that four-year-old series in favor of the (at the time) new Galaxy S24 series. The company also already met its previous agreement of three major Android OS upgrades, going from Android 10 to 13 in 2022.</p><p>After spending over a year with quarterly patches, Samsung delivered its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s20-series-software-updates-samsung-support-ends">final security patch to the series</a> in April 2025 (or so we thought).</p><p>The company's security page no longer lists the main Galaxy S20 series after that update in April. It seemed to suggest that Samsung was done with the trio, considering its removal, but this new update for Q3 2025 goes against that. Perhaps now we've received the final patch. The Galaxy S20 FE was held separate from the main flagship group; however, its intended update for Q3 2025 might be its last.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Sure, you might have wished to see an OLED display, but the LCD panel is still crisp thanks to its 1920 x 1200 resolution.</p><p>What about performance? Well, the Tab A9+ is powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 695, paired with 4GB of RAM and up to 128GB of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-micro-sd-card-android">expandable storage</a>. As for battery life, the Tab A9+ will just keep chugging along, as its  7,040mAh battery is rated for up to 20 hours on a single charge.</p><p>You'll also enjoy some surprising features, such as split-screen multitasking, Gaming Hub, and even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-should-make-dex-tablet-default">Samsung DeX</a>. So not only can use the Tab A9+ as a traditional tablet, but plug it into a monitor, and have a desktop-like experience.</p><p>The only glaring issue that I can see with the Galaxy Tab A9+ is its lack of S Pen support. That's definitely a bummer, but there are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-stylus-android-phones-and-tablets">other stylus options</a> out there that can help fill the void if you want to use this as a digital notebook.</p> ]]></dc:content>

In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/how-galaxy-watchs-innovative-sensor-breaks-new-ground-in-preventative-care">blog post</a>, the company states consumers with a Galaxy Watch 8 will have access to its Ectopic Beat Detection software for "actionable" insights. Samsung states this feature is designed to help users detect early signs of "premature heartbeats."</p><p>These early heartbeats, which is states can typically go unnoticed during routine checkups, can lead to arrhythmia and potentially evolve into a risk of heart failure.</p><p>The post highlights the Galaxy Watch 8's "enhanced" ECG sensor and its ability to inform users if it detects signs of ectopic beats.</p><p>Vascular Load is another preventative care feature Samsung has packed into the Galaxy Watch 8. This was a feature it teased a little before the devices launched in July, touting it as an AI-powered feature designed to determine the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/i-think-samsung-health-likely-to-get-ai-subscription-soon">strain on your heart</a>." Today, Samsung says that the watches utilize PPG waveforms to measure your blood flow and vascular stiffness throughout the night.</p><p>Samsung reports that daily stress, diet, and how much rest you get can affect this aspect of your health. If left unchecked, it could lead to more serious cardiovascular concerns.</p><h2 id="changing-lifestyle-habits-2">Changing Lifestyle Habits</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="D6vjSqfonSvkje2X3yrZUE" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-antioxidant-index-fruits-and-veggies" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic on a person's wrist showing the Antioxidant Index widget with a "Low" score, held in front of two bowls containing colorful fruits and veggies." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/D6vjSqfonSvkje2X3yrZUE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Aside from an early warning system, Samsung says the Galaxy Watch 8 can also help users make well-informed decisions about their lifestyle. For example, the series features an "Antioxidant Index," which uses its BioActive sensors to scan your skin carotenoids. What this returns is a well-informed look into antioxidant levels, primarily based on the amount of fruits and vegetables you've consumed.</p><p>Users are given a score between 0-100. While Samsung says low fruit and vegetable intake can negatively impact this score (and your health overall), other factors like your diet, UV light exposure, and more can impact your antioxidant levels.</p><p>Additionally, "Bedtime Guidance" is designed to help users "build healthier sleep routines that lead to deeper, less interrupted sleep and more energized mornings." Samsung says this was developed alongside KAIST to help users understand their bodies and the right amount of sleep for them.</p><h2 id="the-galaxy-watch-8-aid-right-on-your-wrist-2">The Galaxy Watch 8: aid right on your wrist</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="AZB6LwhrYbHgfNMYZPo8aG" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-watch-ultra-2-hands-on-4" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 antioxidant measuring results with Samsung Health on Fold 7 hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AZB6LwhrYbHgfNMYZPo8aG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung has been pushing the Galaxy Watch 8's health features, as we've seen with its Preventative Care (early detection) and lifestyle monitoring capabilities.

Meta's 2023 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/reality-labs-shows-off-prototypes">Butterscotch Varifocal prototype</a> was the first to achieve 60 PPD, the "retinal resolution" threshold required to clearly render the 20/20 line of an eye chart.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1326px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="o6tidfKWp5vCoTFeEP6W8V" name="Meta-Tiramisu-prototype-SIGGRAPH-2025" alt="A photo of the Meta Tiramisu prototype on a man's face, a VR headset with a longer-than average design jutting out nearly a foot." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o6tidfKWp5vCoTFeEP6W8V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1326" height="746" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Meta Tiramisu </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Tiramisu's ultra-bright, high-res prototype crushes the retinal resolution threshold by an extra 30 PPD. The trade-off is that it only hits 33 degrees FoV, well below the range for proper immersion. They also "deprioritized the form factor," says OPALS scientist Xuan Wang, with heavier glass lenses for the best visual fidelity on par with HDR TVs.</p><p>Tiramisu would be inordinately expensive and uncomfortable for consumers. But it's a physical and metaphorical window into Reality Labs' investment in true visual immersion for future headsets. We wonder if it's one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/james-cameron-thinks-vr-is-definitive-way-to-watch-his-movies">"f***ing cool" prototypes James Cameron tried</a> that got him invested in VR filmmaking with Meta.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kKz2RmqXERRovsiAWQsYCV" name="Meta-Boba-3-prototype-SIGGRAPH-2025" alt="A photo of a man wearing the Meta Boba 3 prototype headset with a finger raised to tap a virtual object." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kKz2RmqXERRovsiAWQsYCV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Boba 3 prototype, on the other hand, looks more polished and practical, though still a premium device. Developed by the Reality Labs Display Systems Research (DSR) team, it hits a 180-degree horizontal field of view (FoV) and 120-degree vertical FoV, using pancake lenses to keep it reasonably light at 660g.</p><p>It also uses "high-curvature reflective polarizers" to prevent light reflection, a necessity given that the curved display essentially points at itself along the edge.</p><p>Boba 3 delivers 30 PPD, slightly better than the Quest 3, but hitting 4K x 4K resolution with such a wide display has an incredible power demand, says DSR scientist Yang Zhao. Boba 3 "requires a top-of-the-line GPU and PC system" to fill all of that visual space; it's "not going to easily hit a mass-market price point," nor work as an all-in-one Quest-type product.</p><p>Still, it's impressive to see how the Boba 3 prototype covers 90% of the "FOV of the human visual system," to the point that you'd barely see any darkness around the display.</p><h2 id="will-the-meta-quest-4-follow-these-prototypes-example-2">Will the Meta Quest 4 follow these prototypes' example?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NmDJXz88WTPt4c2zZgLVCV" name="Meta-Boba-VR-prototypes" alt="A photo of Meta's prototype Boba 1, Boba 2, and Boba 3 headsets from left to right on a table, showing how they've gotten much smaller over time." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NmDJXz88WTPt4c2zZgLVCV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Boba 1, 2, and 3 prototypes </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The blog post stresses that these are "purely research prototypes, with novel technologies that may never make their way into a consumer product."</p><p>But even if the Quest 4 can't match them, we can certainly hope it'll follow in these prototypes' footsteps and aspire to greater visual fidelity. Or if not, maybe the Quest 5 will.</p><p>"We’re working to figure out what lies beyond television and laptop screens," says DSR Director Douglas Lanman. "We’re just trying to make something awesome—not just as a demo, but as something that we’d use every day. And that really is the true Turing test: Are we excited about what we’re doing after a decade of doing it?"</p><p>Meta, as a company, is definitely interested in replacing TVs with its headsets. Meta's head of Oculus Publishing said earlier this year that by 2027, Meta wants to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/gdc-2025-oculus-publishing-head-challenges-meta-criticism-on-quest-store-profitability">target young adults who will use the Quest as a "high-end TV."</a></p><p>It's a natural assumption that the Quest 4 will need to deliver better resolution and FoV to make its entertainment experience more dynamic. Its designers may have looked to OPALS and DSR for technical inspiration.</p><p>But the Quest 4 must also be light enough to be worn for hours and affordable enough that consumers will buy it. We'll see if it successfully hits that balance.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Furthermore, the foldable is powered by the same Tensor G4 chipset that drives the rest of the Pixel 9 series, and you'll also get the same seven years of guaranteed OS and security support. </p><p>The trade-offs include some relatively disappointing camera tech (it's passable, but nothing amazing) and a lack of stylus support. These wouldn't be major issues on a different phone, but at this price I want to be blown away, and the Pixel 9 Pro Fold just isn't as performant as we wanted in those regards. </p><p>With the imminent arrival of the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold on August 20th (not to mention the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review#section-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-software">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> from Samsung), last year's model could easily go overlooked. But if you enjoy the Pixel ecosystem and you're trying to get into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a>, this Best Buy deal presents a unique opportunity. After all, it's not like we expect the Pixel 10 Pro Fold to be <em>that</em> different from its predecessor, so why not go last-gen and save some serious cash in the process?</p> ]]></dc:content>

The triple camera array is off to one side of the phone, with its placement looking a lot like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-vs-google-pixel-9-pro-apple-or-google">iPhone 16 Pro</a>. The image shows the device in a silver/white colorway, contrary to previous rumors of it launching in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-15-battery-leak-3569929/">SuperBlack color option </a>that makes the device look like a “black hole,” which is said to absorb 99.9% of all visible light.</p><p>This leak reinforces the fact that the triple camera setup (wide, ultra-wide, and 3x periscope) would feature 50MP lenses and a periscope telephoto lens, which could be as high as 200MP, according to a previous leak on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/PwM6XAI07">Weibo</a>.</p><blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oneplus/comments/1mizj4f/oneplus_15_redesigned_hasselblad_camera_flagship">OnePlus 15: Redesigned Hasselblad Camera Flagship & Key Specs Leaked</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oneplus">r/oneplus</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><p>We also know that OnePlus could potentially be letting go of its long-term relationship with Hasselblad, which could be the reason behind the redesign.</p><p>The Reddit post also mentions the alleged key specs of the device. Regarding the phone's screen, the tipster claims that the OnePlus 15 will feature a flat 1.5K AMOLED display with ultra-thin bezels, using LIPO display technology, measuring <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-leak-drops-some-spicy-changes-and-not-in-a-good-way-for-everyone">6.7 inches</a>. Additionally, the device is said to feature a<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-specs-chipset-camera-leaks"> "symmetrical front,"</a> meaning that all four bezels—top, bottom, and sides—are of equal or near-equal thickness, creating a cleaner design aesthetic, much like Apple's iPhones.</p><p>Under the hood, the device is said to have the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-2">Snapdragon 8 Elite 2</a>, rumored to be launching in September this year.

The Watch 8 comes in two sizes of 40mm and 44mm, with prices starting at $349.99 and $379.99, respectively. The 40mm Galaxy Watch 8 features a 325mAh battery, and the 44mm version has a 435mAh capacity. Despite the difference in capacities, though, Samsung estimates up to 40 hours of runtime on one charge for both sizes. With the Always-on Display (AOD) feature enabled, this is said to drop to 30 hours.</p><p>While we've not yet tested the Galaxy Watch 8, we have finished our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic-review">review of the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic</a>, which comes in a single 46mm dial size with a 445mAh battery.  Interestingly, Samsung has the same battery life estimates for the Classic as well. In our testing, we found the Watch 8 Classic to last for roughly 25 hours when really pushed, but it's usually double that when usage is light.</p><p>Since the 44mm version of the Galaxy Watch 8 has nearly the same capacity as the Watch 8 Classic, you should expect a similar battery life too. The same would apply to the 40mm version, too, since the smaller battery will be powering a smaller display. Overall, you should expect the Watch 8 to easily last an average of 1–2 days between charges, as do most of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-smartwatch">best Samsung watches</a>.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="d3ec1869-e255-4699-9ac5-2069455a1e1d">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bPLi3GK48NDVrnUA6ydiWi.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 44mm"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Watch 8</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>A good starter option</strong></em></p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 has a new design and some cool new health tracking features.

No, the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 isn't perfect. It is, however, another few steps closer to the "endgame" for clamshell foldables — a slab phone you can fold in half without losing much. Instead of talking about the Galaxy Z Flip 7 in terms of compromises, we're now looking at all the exclusive features and capabilities it offers compared to normal phones.</p><p>If you recently picked up a new Galaxy Z Flip 7, or are thinking of buying one, you'll want to do these 10 things immediately after unboxing it. They cover everything from the basics, to exclusive Samsung foldable features, to useful AI tools. Some are new to the Galaxy Z Flip 7, and others have been staples of past Galaxy Z Flip models.</p><p>But every single one represents an essential tip or trick that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> owners need to know.

They include setting up your biometrics, downloading your preferred password manager, and logging into your Google and Samsung accounts. You should also check for early updates by going to <strong>Settings</strong> > <strong>Software update</strong> > <strong>Download and install</strong>. The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-new-foldables-get-first-update-just-days-after-launch" target="_blank">has already received its first OTA update</a>, so be sure to install it.</p><p>We'd also recommend tweaking your phone's settings to match your preferences. A common frustration with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review">One UI 7</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/my-8-favorite-things-about-the-one-ui-8-beta">One UI 8</a> is a change to lock screen notifications that shows icons instead of banners by default.

Personally, I always turn off <strong>Adaptive brightness</strong> on my phones and even switch on <strong>Extra brightness</strong>. Sometimes, I'll swap out Samsung Keyboard for Gboard.</p><p>Whatever your list of base-level Android modifications is, make sure you handle those before moving to anything else.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-customize-the-cover-screen"><span>Customize the cover screen</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NGZUhPJp2GBY6x54KGaxCS" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-7-vs-Flip-6-Cover-Screen-3" alt="The cover screen experience on the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 compared to the Galaxy Z Flip 6." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NGZUhPJp2GBY6x54KGaxCS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 has a larger, 4.1-inch cover screen that tries to make it easier to view glanceable information and take actions without opening your phone. In my experience, that effort falls flat because <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-cover-screen-is-somehow-worse-than-the-flip-6">certain cover screen options are gone in One UI 8</a> on the Flip 7. Still, there are a handful of things you can do to make the cover screen your own.</p><p>To do so, you can start by swiping to a widget panel on the cover screen, holding it, and pressing the <strong>Edit</strong> button. This will require you to open the phone, and it'll open up a Settings page for the cover screen. Alternatively, you can open the <strong>Settings </strong>app and tap <strong>Cover screen</strong> with the display open to get to this same spot. This is where you can manage widgets, lock screen and clock, notifications, and cover screen timeout.</p><p>After tapping the <strong>Widgets</strong> tab, you can start customizing your cover screen. Most widgets will be either 2x2 or 2x4 in size, so you can fit either two or four widgets per panel. Some third-party app widgets are supported on the cover screen, like Spotify, but these are the exception, not the rule. You can pick any widgets you like — I have Samsung Health, Sleep, Weather, News, Voice Recorder, and Battery on my cover screen.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-enable-cover-screen-apps-with-multistar"><span>Enable cover screen apps with MultiStar</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NvH7PCi7foMaDkAYZ8v2LH" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-7-Cover-Screen-2" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 in black." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NvH7PCi7foMaDkAYZ8v2LH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Apps aren't fully supported on the Galaxy Z Flip 7 cover screen, no matter what you install or which Labs features you enable. However, there are a few things you can do to make the experience usable. The first thing to do is add the <strong>Apps</strong> widget to your cover screen using the steps in the section above. This will give you a small home screen launcher with only a select few official apps — on my Flip 7, the only options are Google Maps, Google Messages, and (oddly) YouTube.</p><p>To find this page from anywhere, you can search <strong>Apps allowed on cover screen</strong> in the <strong>Settings</strong> app.</p><p>At the bottom of the screen, there's a <strong>Get MultiStar</strong> button that you should press if you want to run more cover screen apps. This will enable what is called the <strong>Launcher Widget</strong>, an experimental option that lets you run virtually any app on the cover screen.  I use the Tesla app on the cover screen of my Flip 7 to precondition my car without unfolding it. We have a complete guide to running apps on Galaxy Z Flip cover screens <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-set-up-and-use-apps-on-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-cover-screen">here</a>.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-try-out-flex-mode"><span>Try out Flex Mode</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2J9YmCizujpTX4f3qA6Tn8" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-7-Review-22" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2J9YmCizujpTX4f3qA6Tn8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-force-flex-mode-apps-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3">Flex Mode</a> is one of my favorite ways to use Samsung foldables, and it's a Galaxy Z Flip 7 essential. The way it works is simple. Open the foldable about halfway and rest it on a table, sort of like a laptop. Then, a small icon will float in the bottom-left corner of your screen. Tap it, and you'll see the Flex Mode user interface take over.</p><p>The Flex Mode experience will differ slightly depending on what's on your screen at the time. Some apps natively support Flex Mode, like YouTube, so you'll see video on the top half of the screen and playback controls, comments, and the description on the bottom. Other media apps might not, but One UI 8 creates a Flex Mode interface for it anyway.

The rear camera on this phone <em>is</em> your selfie camera, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-flip-phones-my-favorite-camera-tricks">versatility is one of the best parts of daily driving a foldable</a>. To try it, open the camera from the cover screen just like you would on any Android phone. There are multiple ways to do so, including a double-press of the power button.</p><p>Don't just use it for selfies — get creative. Your Galaxy Z Flip 7 can also be used as a tripod thanks to its folding form factor. Next, try <strong>Cover screen preview</strong> —  it's the Flip 7 icon in the top-right corner of the camera app when unfolded. It'll show a preview of the viewfinder on the cover screen, so your subject can see how they look before you snap a picture.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WRrERqDHeGkDgyGqYnETX9" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-7-Review-12" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WRrERqDHeGkDgyGqYnETX9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Don't sleep on <strong>Camcorder mode</strong> — a fun way to take videos like it's the 2000s again.

Thanks to a new leak, we may have an idea of what's in store for the Pixel 10 series set to launch later this month.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/google-pixel-10-camera-coach">Android Headlines</a>, Google will integrate an AI-powered feature called "Camera Coach", and as the name suggests, it will coach users on how to click better, real-time images on their new Pixel device. Much like having a professional photographer teach you better techniques and best practices to achieve the perfect shot, on the go. This means you won't have to save those Instagram Reels teaching you how to adjust the aperture or use a different mode to take your pictures; it all comes built into the phone itself.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:832px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.77%;"><img id="6MekhJAJ4Pc5Wngw5b7d26" name="google-play-store-pixel-10-promo-leaked" alt="A leaked image of the entire Pixel 10 series (in moonstone and indigo), as leaked via a Play Store discovery." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6MekhJAJ4Pc5Wngw5b7d26.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="832" height="464" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The publication further notes how this feature might potentially come into play. "Things like adjusting your angle to better frame the picture, adjusting the lighting, and more." The feature sounds more like Gemini Live, but here you let the Camera Coach read the scene and offer suggestions based on what it's looking at.</p><p>This could potentially require users to live record their screen, or an icon could pop up, like Gemini, with prompts suggesting better photography tips. It remains a mystery how the Camera Coach will be able to read the scene; however, it seems like all this will happen instantly as the user turns on their camera.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Get outside your comfort phone | 8.20.25Learn more and sign up for #MadeByGoogle updates: https://t.co/JOdjGMGYxY pic.twitter.com/nvXep5w5Ru<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1952400812862324931">August 4, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>Google seems to be leaning into Gemini to enhance the device's camera capabilities, or simply teach people how to use their phone's camera to the fullest.

With this feature, you can have a conversation with Gemini, asking it to make certain edits to their photos, like erasing noise, changing background, removing unnecessary objects, essentially giving them a clearer image.</p><p>While all this sounds fascinating, it remains unclear whether these features will be available only on the new flagship series or if Google will expand them to older Pixel devices.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:537px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:111.73%;"><img id="hEitAw9AxBy2uN9FNChNKj" name="google-photos-ask-photos-quicker-answers" alt="Google Photos is boosting Ask Photos with quicker response times for broad/simple queries, while Gemini works in the background for more a more detailed/specific response." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hEitAw9AxBy2uN9FNChNKj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="537" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That said, several rumors have suggested, the base Pixel 10 will show up with a triple camera array (including a 50MP main, a 12MP ultrawide, and an additional 10.8MP telephoto lens with 5x optical zoom) this time around. This was also confirmed by Google when it dropped a quick tease of the phone earlier this week. While the base model gets a bump with its camera specs, the Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL might see no change in terms of their camera hardware, which means Google needs to rely heavily on Gemini to up the ante on these next-gen flagships.</p><p>All eyes are on Google as it is all set to unveil the Pixel 10 series on August 20 in New York, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/made-by-google-2025-how-to-watch-pixel-10-launch-and-what-to-expect">here's what we expect to see coming from the event.</a></p> ]]></dc:content>

It's a question that's probably crossed your mind while scrolling through your gallery. The magic behind those impressive night shots isn't a single feature, but a symphony of hardware and software working in perfect harmony.</p><p>It's a far cry from the blurry, noisy images that were once the hallmark of low-light photography on older phones. Today's "night sight" and "astrophotography" photos are a testament to how far mobile technology has come.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ranYPSWZK7J6rgXNqzhDzh" name="Google-Pixel-8-astrophotography-sample.jpg" alt="Photo of the stars taken from a Google Pixel 8 using astrophotography mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ranYPSWZK7J6rgXNqzhDzh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2295" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Photo of the stars taken from a Google Pixel 8 using astrophotography mode. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A great night shot begins with the most fundamental component: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-wants-rival-human-eye-600mp-camera-sensors">camera sensor</a>.  Think of the sensor as the camera's eye, capturing light and converting it into an electrical signal. In low-light situations, the challenge is to gather as much light as possible.</p><p>A camera sensor can see a lot more than your eye can, and sees more colors. That's why <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/may-2024-northern-lights-pixel-8-pro-galaxy-s24-plus">photos of the Northern Lights</a> looked better than the real thing; the camera processed all that information we <em>couldn't</em> see into something we can.</p><p>This is why a larger sensor can be important. A bigger sensor has more surface area, allowing it to collect even more photons (light particles) and produce a cleaner, less noisy image.</p><p>Alongside a larger sensor, a wider aperture helps, too. The aperture is the opening in the lens that lets light in. A wider aperture, represented by a smaller f-number (e.g., f/1.8 vs. f/2.2), allows more light to reach the sensor in a given amount of time. This combination of a large sensor and a wide aperture is the hardware foundation of a good night camera.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-now-for-the-software-magic"><span>Now for the software magic</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6z8YsHrdksXgK2xLaPUMC5" name="Nothing-Phone-3-lens" alt="Nothing teases Phone 3 camera" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6z8YsHrdksXgK2xLaPUMC5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nothing)</span></figcaption></figure><p>But hardware is only a small part of the story. The real secret sauce is the software, which uses a technique called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/computational-photography">computational photography</a>. This is the brain behind the brawn, processing and enhancing the raw data captured by the sensor. The most important technique in this arsenal is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://photographylife.com/night-sky-image-stacking" target="_blank">image stacking</a>.</p><p>When you press the shutter button in night sight mode, your phone doesn't just take one picture. It takes a rapid-fire series of photos, often a dozen or more, in a second or two. These individual photos are all slightly different, some a little underexposed, others slightly overexposed. They all contain a bit of noise, too, but the noise is random and different in each frame. That's important, and means that with enough frames, you can have a clear set of data for everything.</p><p>After capturing these multiple images, the phone's processor gets to work. It aligns all the frames, compensating for any minor hand shake you might have had while holding the phone. Then, it uses a sophisticated algorithm to "stack" them on top of each other.</p><p>By averaging the pixel values of all the aligned images, the random noise that appeared in each individual photo is effectively canceled out, leaving behind a much cleaner, sharper base image. This is a lot like how a student might get a more accurate grade by averaging the scores from multiple tests instead of just one.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-off-to-you-ai"><span>Off to you, AI</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fh74GxgsiaGa2xxK5wsmb7" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-iphone-15-pro-max-3.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro XL with iPhone 15 Pro Max" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fh74GxgsiaGa2xxK5wsmb7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The process doesn't stop there. Once the noise is reduced, the software performs further processing to enhance the final image. It "intelligently" brightens the darker areas of the photo without blowing out the highlights. It also adjusts the contrast and color balance to make the image look more natural and vibrant. This is where different smartphone brands develop their unique "look."</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-vs-pixel-9-pro">Google's Pixel 9</a>, for example, is known for its strong emphasis on realistic colors and contrast, while other manufacturers like Samsung might opt for a more vibrant, saturated look with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/which-samsung-galaxy-s25-model-should-you-buy">Galaxy S25</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure pull-right inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="5pPUTjfPXxFsddsQG6toeN" name="Camera-sample-collage-6" alt="A church at night" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5pPUTjfPXxFsddsQG6toeN.jpg" mos="" align="right" fullscreen="1" width="4096" height="3072" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-right expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class="pull-right inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 (top left), Galaxy Z Flip 6 (top right), OPPO Find N5 (bottom left), and Pixel 9 (bottom right). </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>AI also helps the software identify objects in the scene, like faces or landscapes, and apply specific optimizations to make them look their best.</p><p>This is why every "night mode" photo you take will look a little bit different. The source may be the same, but there is a bit of wiggle room for the software to process everything. It may slightly change the color, sharpen some areas more than others, and even make the edges of objects slightly different. The end goal is to produce something that meets a set of overall parameters that we like to see.</p><p>The next time you marvel at a stunning night shot from your phone, remember what's happening under the hood. It's not just a lucky shot. It's a complex, multi-step process that starts with an adequate sensor and lens, captures a burst of images, uses powerful software to stack and average them, and then intelligently enhances the final product.</p><p>It's a perfect example of how computational photography has democratized a once-specialized area of photography, allowing everyone to capture beautiful images even when the sun has gone down.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-we-ve-come-a-long-way"><span>We've come a long way</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XjstzTFNrQaNsLNADGnenW" name="Google Pixel 5 camera app.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 5 camera app pointed at a pathway through trees outdoors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XjstzTFNrQaNsLNADGnenW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The journey from grainy, unusable night photos to the clear, vibrant images we see today has been a rapid one. Early smartphone cameras were simply not equipped for low-light conditions. Their small sensors and narrow apertures meant they couldn't gather enough light. To compensate, the camera would increase its sensitivity (a setting called ISO), which made the image brighter but introduced a massive amount of noise, turning the photo into a pixelated mess.</p><p>The breakthrough came with the realization that instead of trying to capture a perfect image in a single shot, it was better to use software to combine multiple imperfect shots. This idea, which had been used in professional astrophotography for years, was adapted for the mobile world.</p><p>Google's introduction of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-bringing-pixel-4s-improved-night-sight-3-and-3a">Night Sight on the Pixel 3</a> in 2018 was a landmark moment, popularizing the concept and pushing other manufacturers to develop their own versions. Apple's Night Mode, Samsung's Night Mode, and others all follow a similar principle of computational photography using specialized hardware and custom software.</p><p>These features have fundamentally changed how we think about mobile photography. They've given us the ability to capture moments that were once impossible without a bulky DSLR camera and a tripod.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-tips-for-taking-better-night-photos-with-your-phone"><span>Tips for Taking Better Night Photos with Your Phone</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:720px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:59.72%;"><img id="GSGoCnkXcTth4KBg5MwJcR" name="golden-ratio-photography.jpg" alt="The golden ratio depicted on an image" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GSGoCnkXcTth4KBg5MwJcR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="720" height="430" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Adobe)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Even with all this technology, there are a few simple things you can do to get the best possible night shots.</p><p><strong>Hold Still:</strong> This is the most important tip. Since the phone is taking multiple photos over a few seconds, any movement can cause blur. Find a stable surface to rest your phone on, or simply hold it as still as you possibly can.</p><p><strong>Tap to Focus:</strong> Before you press the shutter, tap on the darkest part of the scene to tell the camera where to focus and expose correctly. This will help the phone's algorithm work more effectively.</p><p><strong>Clean Your Lens:</strong> A smudged lens can make a huge difference in low light. A quick wipe with a soft cloth can improve sharpness and reduce glare from light sources.</p><p><strong>Don't Zoom:</strong> Digital zoom is a recipe for a blurry, noisy mess. It's always better to get closer to your subject or crop the photo later.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="c69ed741-a4ce-44de-a2f4-59c3bd550ab2">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RGLzkSSEaGTvsjXvJayfZN.jpg' alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro official render - Hazel - Front/Back"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 9 Pro</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Night Mode king</strong></em></p><p>Google is known for having excellent low-light and nighttime photography, and the Pixel 9 Pro continues that trend, thanks to the company's excellent computational photography.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

The images appear ripped right from Google, giving us a clear window into what the largest Pixel this year will offer. At first glance, the Pixel 10 Pro XL's design is vastly similar to what we received last year with the 9 Pro XL.</p><p>Google is seemingly continuing the flat sides and rounded corners for the 10 Pro XL, just like the rest of the series.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:496px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:120.97%;"><img id="vPipciEC7hA2zcRHEWntMd" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-render-obsidian" alt="A leaked render of the Pixel 10 Pro XL in a dark Obsidian (black) color." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vPipciEC7hA2zcRHEWntMd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="496" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WinFuture)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The publication claims the sides are crafted from metal with a "polished surface." The display's bezels seem quite thin in the renderings, meaning consumers may find quite a large viewing surface on the Pixel 10 Pro XL this year. The phone will also sport a triple camera array for its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-design-lead-discusses-large-camera-visor">large camera housing</a>.</p><p>The base Pixel 10 appeared in a set of renderings showing off its long-rumored "Indigo" color option. It seems Google will spread those Indigo vibes across the entirety of the phone, meaning its camera bar, flat sides, and physical buttons will take on the hue. The alleged specifications for the base model state consumers could see a similar 50MP main camera, 48MP ultra-wide lens, and an added 48MP telephoto.</p><h2 id="we-re-not-far-now-2">We're not far now</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:497px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:120.72%;"><img id="9eiGLUaUkmqGJBKpPaU9Bc" name="google-pixel-10-indigo-rendering-example-leak" alt="A leaked render of the base Pixel 10 phone in "Indigo."" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9eiGLUaUkmqGJBKpPaU9Bc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="497" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WinFuture)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Leaks about the Pixel 10 series' specs have been bubbling up all summer, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/googles-pixel-10-pro-and-xl-cameras-may-see-no-upgrades-leak-reveals">the one from June</a> had a lot to share. Over a month ago, rumors claimed the Pixel 10 Pro XL was on the way with a 6.8-inch display, slightly larger than the Pixel 10 Pro's 6.3-inch screen. As expected, the new series should rock Google's newest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/is-googles-switch-from-samsung-foundry-to-tsmc-for-the-tensor-g5-chip-a-big-deal">Tensor G5</a> chipset, which should bring worthwhile improvements over the minimalistic Tensor G4.</p><p>Charging speeds for the Pro XL is expected to sit around 39W, while its wireless charging could reach 15W. This model is rumored to receive the largest battery in a Pixel phone at 5,200mAh. Elsewhere, it seems the Pro XL model will drop the lowest storage option and find solace in 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB variations.</p><p>A week ago, there were rumors about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10-series-pricing-leak-staggering-alleged-fold-model">Google's potential pricing</a> for the Pixel 10 series.

The first pertains to Instagram's Map feature, which lets users share "their last active location" with their friends. Essentially, users can soon view the Instagram Map and see where their friends are posting new content from. Tapping the DMs icon at the top right of the app and viewing the side-scrolling menu will display the new "Map" icon.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:691px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:86.83%;"><img id="wVPntoQHFTppa9Kxy4CpKn" name="instagram-maps-update-location-sharing" alt="Instagram Maps lets users see where their friends are in the world through location-sharing." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wVPntoQHFTppa9Kxy4CpKn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="691" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>From there, Meta states users can view "location-based" Instagram content by seeing where everyone is on a map (if they're sharing their location). If someone has posted a new Reel, Story, or post, and their location-sharing is active, users will see their circular icon and a thumbnail of their content.</p><p>This content must be "location-tagged" to appear in Instagram Map, and it will remain there for 24 hours. Newly posted Notes will also be available to view from within Maps, so you'll know where they were when they posted them. The feature gives <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/snapchat-edit-button-teaser-feature-highlights">strong Snapchat vibes</a> back when it rolled out location-sharing and a map for users last year.</p><p>As this rolls out, Meta states location-sharing will be off by default. Moreover, you can decide who you're sharing your location with. Users will see options for "friends" (users who follow you back), Close Friends, Only Selected Friends, and "no one." If you decide to share your location, Meta says your location will only update when you open the app or return to it.</p><p>Instagram Map is rolling out to users in the U.S. today (Aug 6). Instagram previously <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/instagram-share-location-nicknames-dms-update">rolled out a location-sharing feature</a>, but that was only for DMs and lacked a complete map with multiple users.</p><h2 id="even-more-for-reels-2">Even more for Reels</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:691px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:86.83%;"><img id="D9CSQvAxhCJUHfjUiDJoKn" name="instagram-repost-reels-posts-example" alt="Instagram is rolling out a repost button for Reels and posts." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/D9CSQvAxhCJUHfjUiDJoKn.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="691" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:692px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:86.71%;"><img id="EdNaPmASLk4GjP47tqjT9m" name="instagram-friends-reels-tab-example" alt="Instagram Reels picks up a new "Friends" tab, letting users see what their friends and family are interacting with on the app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EdNaPmASLk4GjP47tqjT9m.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="692" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Like other social media sites (Threads, X), Instagram is finally getting its own "repost" button for posts and Reels.</p><p>The blog post states that when you've reposted a Reel or post, it will be credited to the original user who uploaded said content. However, your icon will be present at the bottom left corner with a purple repost icon, letting your followers know you've shared something new. Meta says this could be a great way for content creators to reach new audiences, as their posts may be recommended more widely.</p><p>Additionally, if you're reposting something, Instagram will give you a small speech bubble to tag a note along with it.</p><p>The Reels update doesn't end there, as Instagram is finally rolling out its new "Friends" tab globally. Through this tab, Meta says users can find the Reels their friends have either posted or interacted with in some way. Recommendations via your "Blend" with a friend will appear in this new tab, too.</p><p>This tab will be placed at the top of Reels. Instagram highlights new controls for users for the Friends tab, such as the ability to hide your likes and comments.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It's been nearly two years since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review">Venu 3</a> launched in late August 2023, and it's still arguably Garmin's best all-around smartwatch that athletes can reasonably afford. Given that, the Garmin Venu 4 has high standards to meet and the potential to excite or disappoint fans in equal measure.</p><p>Garmin itself <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://garminrumors.com/first-signs-of-venu-4-coming-soon-garmin-japan-drops-a-clue/">leaked the Venu 4 name</a> in a description of the Japanese Garmin golf app, saying it would get premium golf features that the expensive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-x1-bizarre-premium-watch-stuck-between-two-worlds">Garmin Venu X1</a> received earlier this year.</p><p>Otherwise, we don't <em>officially </em>know anything about this watch. But we can look at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-venu-x1-vs-venu-3">Venu X1 upgrades over the Venu 3</a> — plus the pricier Fenix 8 and Venu-lite Vivoactive 6 — and get a pretty good idea of what tricks the Venu 4 will receive to refresh the Venu 3 template.</p><p>Here's everything we expect from the Venu 4, along with everything we truly <em>hope</em> Garmin will add, even if the odds are slim.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-most-likely-garmin-venu-4-features"><span>The most likely Garmin Venu 4 features</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ySjxwMw9LpmNoqkiNjv3en" name="Garmin-Venu-3-ecg.jpeg" alt="An ECG summary page on the Garmin Venu 3 saying the author's sinus rhythm is normal" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ySjxwMw9LpmNoqkiNjv3en.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Venu 3's ECG app </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Garmin Venu 4 should emulate the Venu 3 with two AMOLED touch display sizes (1.2 and 1.4 inches), a mic & speaker, all-systems GNSS tracking (but no dual-band GPS), an altimeter for elevation data, a gyroscope for accurate workout tracking, music storage, Garmin Pay, and at least the 5th-generation Elevate sensor with ECG and skin temp readings.</p><p>It should bring back the core Garmin health and training tools like Body Battery, Sleep Coach, intensity minutes, workout benefit, recovery time, animated indoor workouts, running dynamics, running power, and more recent add-ons like Garmin Strength Coach.</p><p>Since the Venu 3 came out, Garmin has continued to update its core UI, and the Venu 4 will have a smarter, more logical navigation layout than the last model. Beyond that, the Venu 4 is due to receive a ton of new features.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="EkFQpAWf9mHKgkxUzDdyVB" name="Garmin-Vivoactive-6-review-16" alt="Workout summary on the Garmin Vivoactive 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EkFQpAWf9mHKgkxUzDdyVB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2295" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Garmin Vivoactive 6 with training effect on a brighter AMOLED display </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The 2025 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-vivoactive-6-review">Vivoactive 6</a> is designed as a cheaper Venu alternative, but since it came out later, it introduced features the Venu 4 is nearly 100% certain to get: move alerts, daily walking suggestions, Garmin Run Coach, prebuilt cycling plans, PacePro, training effect, and the smart alarm that waits to wake you until you're in a light sleep stage.</p><p>Plus, the Vivoactive 6 display — like the Venu X1 and Forerunner 970 displays — is twice as bright as most AMOLED Garmin watches; expect the Venu 4 to hit 2,000 nits, as well.</p><p>The Garmin Venu 3 was one of the first Garmin watches to add a mic & speaker, but it only works for Bluetooth calling and pass-through commands to your phone. Since then, several watches like the Fenix 8 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-forerunner-570-review">Forerunner 570</a> have added on-watch commands like "Start a run activity" or "Show my sleep summary." It's a guarantee the Venu 4 gets these commands.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-everything-we-hope-the-garmin-venu-4-will-add"><span>Everything we hope the Garmin Venu 4 will add</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="yETApyW9rAVbjwmfvyWYcV" name="Garmin-Venu-X1-flashlight" alt="The Garmin Venu X1 sitting on an armrest, pointed toward the camera with the flashlight on." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yETApyW9rAVbjwmfvyWYcV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Venu X1's flashlight </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Frankly, if the Garmin Venu 4 adds all of the above features, that'll be enough to satisfy plenty of people. And the more features Garmin adds, the more justification it will have to raise the Venu 4 price, just as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-3-review">Instinct 3</a> and Forerunner 570 jumped $50 and $100 in price, respectively.</p><p>But if Garmin is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmins-post-tariff-strategy-could-include-pricier-watches-and-cutbacks">determined to charge more</a>, we may as well get even more new features out of the Venu 4! Here's what we want to see, from reasonable possibilities to unlikely hopes.</p><h2 id="a-flashlight-2">A flashlight</h2><p>In the last year, the Fenix 8, Enduro 3, Forerunner 970, Venu X1, and Instinct 3 have all added built-in LED flashlights, though not the Vivoactive 6. The fact that the $550 Forerunner 570 <em>didn't</em> get the flashlight could mean that Garmin reserves this for the top-tier models (and Instinct series built for outdoor use), but it could be a way for Garmin to differentiate this mainline model from other smartwatches, with a feature that's quite popular among Garmin users.</p><h2 id="more-forerunner-training-tools-2">More Forerunner training tools</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="K4QXox3Mu7xdF8YLoCwWgJ" name="Garmin-Forerunner-970-acute-load" alt="The Garmin Forerunner 970 on an armrest, showing the Acute Load widget chart with Optimal range of training load." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/K4QXox3Mu7xdF8YLoCwWgJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Garmin avoids adding overly complicated Forerunner training tools to the Venu series, where they might overwhelm new users. But the Garmin Venu X1 received nearly all the same training features as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-970-review">Forerunner 970</a>, as Garmin couldn't reasonably charge $800 <em>without</em> including them.</p><p>The pricier the Venu 4 gets, the harder it'll be to justify excluding certain tools like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-training-load-focus-needs-one-obvious-fix">training load</a> and training readiness. Most runners and hikers will go for Forerunners and Instincts, but those who will trade extra buttons for a more stylish design still deserve this data, and indoor athletes will benefit from training load data, too.</p><h2 id="breadcrumb-navigation-2">Breadcrumb navigation</h2><p>The Garmin Venu 4 will never get offline maps when the Instinct 3 and Forerunner 570 didn't; it's a frustrating fact that Garmin reserves maps for premium models, even though other brands offer maps on cheap watches.</p><p>What's more surprising is that the Venu 3 doesn't even have point-to-point navigation, so you can't follow a course and see how far you are from your destination. Even if most Venu fans will never use GPX courses, and it's not a priority for an indoor-focused watch, some users will definitely benefit from this.</p><h2 id="elevate-v6-with-new-health-data-2">Elevate v6 with new health data</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="E7ixHzpgpwKsPJexu9UwZ" name="Garmin-Venu-3-sensors.jpeg" alt="A bottom view of the Garmin Venu 3, showing the new Elevate v5 heart rate sensor and the Quick Release watch bands with their sliding pins." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/E7ixHzpgpwKsPJexu9UwZ.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/garmin-venu-2-review">Garmin Venu 2</a> was the first model with the Elevate v4 sensor, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/garmin-venu-2-plus-review">Venu 2 Plus</a> introduced ECG readings, and the Venu 3 was one of the first — after the Fenix 7 Pro — to use the current Elevate v5 sensor with skin temperature. I don't know if Garmin has a new sensor suite ready, but the Venu 4 is a candidate to introduce the 6th-generation version.</p><p>The most obvious upgrade would be additional LEDs for better HR accuracy, but I'm also hoping for new health data. Garmin has patented a method to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-has-patented-long-term-blood-glucose-tracking-heres-how-itd-work">track glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c)</a> for a "long-term indication of the average blood glucose level." More recently, its "pulse spectroscopy" patent discussed ways to track your body's hydration and hemocrit levels. There's no guarantee Garmin will use these patents, but it's an example of how Garmin is looking to expand its health offerings.</p><h2 id="daily-indoor-workout-recommendations-2">Daily indoor workout recommendations</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3822px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PXefbBe2tNuAhWvQJ2oNT3" name="Garmin-Vivoactive-6-review-18" alt="The Garmin Vivoactive 6 daily workout suggestion" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PXefbBe2tNuAhWvQJ2oNT3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3822" height="2150" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Garmin Venu 4 will get the new Garmin Strength Coach for a guided, weeks-long training plan, as well as premade strength, HIIT, cardio, yoga, and pilates workouts. But not everyone likes to follow a rigid, long-term plan; I personally prefer Garmin's daily run suggestions to its structured Run Coach. With daily cycling and walking suggestions available, too, I think daily indoor workout suggestions are the natural next step!</p><p>I'm not sure of the logistics of how they pull this off, as there are so many different types of indoor workouts based on your equipment and abilities. Maybe it'd end up being some kind of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-connect-plus-in-depth-hands-on-much-more-than-an-ai-unfortunately">Garmin Connect Plus feature</a>. Either way, it'd help the Venu 4 compete against the Apple Watch with its curated list of Fitness+ video workouts.</p><h2 id="cellular-data-2">Cellular data</h2><p>I've been waiting for Garmin to get back into selling LTE watches since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/garmin-forerunner-945-lte-review">Forerunner 945 LTE</a>, which solely used it for safety check-ins. The Garmin Venu 4, like the kid-focused <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-bounce-kids-watch-review-the-fun-smartwatch-for-kids">Garmin Bounce</a>, could go beyond that and offer 4G LTE calling or voice message check-ins to Garmin LiveTrack.</p><p>To be clear, I'd want this to be an optional add-on, just as you can pay extra for LTE-capable Apple and Galaxy Watches. The point is that this would be extremely appealing for those who want a phone backup or phone-free workout experience, whether outdoors or at the gym. The current rumor is that Garmin will sell a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/smartwatches/garmin-may-be-adding-huge-lte-upgrade-to-the-fenix-8-smartwatch-heres-what-we-know-so-far">Fenix 8 Pro with LTE</a>, so that's a more likely candidate, but who knows!</p><h2 id="an-even-skinnier-design-2">An even skinnier design</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="JkGxMwiEzRuX98JNARL35C" name="Garmin-Venu-X1-side-view-buttons" alt="A side angle of the Garmin Venu X1 on the author's wrist, the photo angled to show the two side buttons." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JkGxMwiEzRuX98JNARL35C.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Garmin Venu 3 is one of the most stylish <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watches</a> out there, with a cool steel bezel and svelte case.

I'm hoping that Garmin can make the Venu 4 a little more petite while preserving its two-week battery life. That might be an unfair request, but I'll hope for it regardless.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="1f15ac11-b603-45d2-a9a1-640139247b15">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YPdCZ7m4g99urshSyncAJ3.jpg' alt="Render of the Black Garmin Venu X1 smartwatch"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Garmin Venu X1</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Next-level</strong></em></p><p>The Garmin Venu X1 features a brand-new ultra-thin design while building on Garmin's excellent Venyu lineup with features like a large OLED display, long battery life, a built-in flashlight, Garmin's excellent fitness tracking features, and much more.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

The tipster's repository suggests the device will launch with four watch band colors and three main body 41mm variations. Those colors are as follows: Iris (silver body), Lemongrass (brass body), Porcelain, and Obsidian (obsidian body).</p><p>For its 45mm version, the tipster alleges a Moonstone, Porcelain, and Obsidian.</p><p>The supposed renders of the Pixel Watch 4 are another major talking point of this rumor. The tipster's images showcase the device straight on, which seems to highlight its thinner bezels. Aside from that, the rest of the device is relatively similar to what we've seen for the past three iterations. The Pixel Watch 4 is still rumored to feature a physical button on its right side with its rotating crown.</p><p>These leaked renders don't give us a good look at its altered back panel, nor the rumored "side-mounted" charging on its left side.

The render highlighted a chance for the device to be placed in a new "cradle" (or whatever they'll call it) to charge while standing on its side. If true, it'll make the Pixel Watch 4 seem like a mini Google Home, as you'll be able to see its clock during its power-up cycle.</p><p>The Pixel Watch 4 could also see a slight indentation on its left side with two charging pins to go with this newly developed charger.</p><p>We've been wondering about the Pixel Watch 4's charging ever since an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/pixel-watch-4-renders-leak-indicate-thicker-build-and-removal-of-charging-pins">initial batch of leaked renders</a> completely left out its necessary pins. While some figured wireless charging was on the way, it seems we might be headed in a new direction. Also, aside from thinner bezels for its domed-glass display, the Pixel Watch 4 is reportedly thicker, possibly indicating a bigger battery.</p><p>The Made by Google event is slated for August 20, where we should see the Pixel Watch 4 alongside the Pixel 10 series and more. This week's rumors claim the watch might also hit the market for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/turns-out-the-pixel-watch-4s-price-tag-isnt-half-bad">price similar to the Watch 3</a>, too.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It's incredibly slim and light, is powered by Qualcomm's finest silicon, and it features a massive battery with very fast wired and wireless charging. All this at a price that's going to be lower than the Pixel 10 Pro Fold makes it a tempting alternative. When both phones do hit global markets, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">best foldable</a> should you consider buying?</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-pro-fold-vs-honor-magic-v5-design-and-display-2">Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold vs. Honor Magic V5: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1664px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NB3qAgPNtPhFoym7d4HJmV" name="honor-magic-v5-foldable-launch-hero-alt" alt="The Honor Magic V5." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NB3qAgPNtPhFoym7d4HJmV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1664" height="936" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Honor)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Some of the leaked renders of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-fold">Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a> show that the design may not be too different from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>. We should expect similar levels of thickness, too, which is 5.1mm when unfolded and 10.5mm when folded. Compared to the Magic V5, it's likely going to be more of a handful for sure. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold weighed 257 grams, and the Pixel 10 Pro Fold should weigh about the same, if not a bit heavier. We don't see it competing with Honor in the weight department either.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-launches-magic-v5-foldable-yoyo-ai-features-launch">Magic V5</a> looks absolutely stunning thanks to its incredibly slim design. The prominent curvature along the edges, subtle curves and raised edges around the camera module, and four stunning colors make the V5 a thing of beauty. Despite packing massive displays and a large battery, it weighs just 217 grams and unfolds to a thickness of just 4.1mm. Those are some bonkers specs right there. Instead of glass, Honor uses an aerospace fibre for the back panel, which keeps the weight down and improves durability.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1410px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="jSRhLoe44R6XJ2p4tiUrj" name="google-pixel-10-pro-fold-leaked-render-top-bottom" alt="A leaked render of the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, which shows off its full internal display and rear camera housing, which hosts three lenses." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jSRhLoe44R6XJ2p4tiUrj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1410" height="793" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Honor Magic V5 boasts of two impressive AMOLED displays. There's a 6.43-inch outer screen and a 7.95-inch folding one. Both support LTPO 120Hz refresh rates, up to 5,000 nits of peak brightness, and an incredibly high 4,320Hz PWM dimming rate. The phone even supports the Honor Magic Pen on both displays, offering up to 4,096 levels of pressure sensitivity, similar to Samsung's S Pen.</p><p>The Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold is said to come with a slightly larger 6.4-inch cover screen with possibly higher peak brightness of around 3,000 nits.

Same goes for the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, which hasn't officially launched yet, but we expect it to start at around $1,799 like the previous model. Both are costly phones, but the Pixel will most likely be easier to buy in most parts of the world, and should also have better after-sales support.</p><p>In terms of core specs, there's plenty of RAM and storage options for the Honor Magic V5, and even the 10 Pro Fold is expected to get a 1TB variant this time. Honor uses Qualcomm's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> SoC in its foldable, which has proven to be very reliable, powerful, and power-efficient. Raw power is one area where Pixels have always been lacking, but this should change with the 10 series.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/is-googles-switch-from-samsung-foundry-to-tsmc-for-the-tensor-g5-chip-a-big-deal">Tensor G5</a> is expected to be a lot better in terms of performance, handling thermals, and power efficiency.</p><div ><table><caption>Specifications</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold (speculative)</p></th><th  ><p>Honor Magic V5</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>Android 16</p><p>Seven years of OS upgrades</p><p></p></td><td  ><p>Android 15, MagicOS 9.0.1</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Folding display</p></td><td  ><p>8-inch Super Actua Flex display, 120Hz LTPO AMOLED (1-120Hz), 2076 x 2152, HDR, 2700 nits, Ultra Thin Glass</p></td><td  ><p>7.95-inch, 120Hz LTPO OLED (1-120Hz), 2172 x 2352, HDR, 5000 nits peak, Honor Super Armored Inner Screen</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Outer display</p></td><td  ><p>6.4-inch Actua display, 120Hz OLED (60-120Hz), 1080 x 2424, HDR, 2700 nits, Gorilla Glass Victus 2</p></td><td  ><p>6.43-inch, 120Hz OLED, 1060 x 2376, HDR, 5000 nits peak, Honor Anti-scratch NanoCrystal Shield</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Tensor G5</p></td><td  ><p>Snapdragon 8 Elite</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>16GB</p></td><td  ><p>16GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB/ 512GB/1TB</p></td><td  ><p>512GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear cameras</p></td><td  ><p>48MP main + 10.8MP telephoto + 10.5MP ultrawide</p></td><td  ><p>50MP main + 64MP telephoto + 50MP ultrawide</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Cover + folding screen cameras</p></td><td  ><p>10MP + 10MP</p></td><td  ><p>20MP + 20MP</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ingress protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td><td  ><p>IP58/ IP59</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, 5G (mmWave and Sub-6), Bluetooth 5.4, NFC, AptX HD, USB-C 3.2, Physical and eSIM, Satellite SOS</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, 5G, Bluetooth 6.0, NFC, AptX HD, USB-C 3.1, Physical and eSIM</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Security</p></td><td  ><p>Side-mounted fingerprint scanner, face unlock</p></td><td  ><p>Side-mounted fingerprint scanner, face unlock</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>5,015mAh</p></td><td  ><p>5,820mAh, 66W wired charging, 50W wireless charging</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions (folded/ unfolded)</p></td><td  ><p>Unkown</p></td><td  ><p>156.8 x 74.3 x 8.8 mm / 156.8 x 145.9 x 4.1 mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Unkown</p></td><td  ><p>Black, Ivory White, Dawn Gold, Reddish Brown</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>One area where the Honor Magic V5 likely has the Pixel 10 Pro Fold beat for sure is battery life. We've not tested either phone yet, but the specs are heavily in Honor's favor. The V5 has a 5,820mAh battery, which is positively huge for such a slim foldable.</p><p>There's also very quick charging, like 66W wired and 50W. The Pixel is expected to have a larger battery than before, at 5,015mAh, and slightly faster wired charging at 25W, which is not even close to what the Magic V5 offers. Wireless charging speeds might still remain the same at 7.5W.</p><p>The Pixel 9 Pro Fold didn't have impressive cameras, as the hardware was reused from the original Fold. This time, Google should bring the camera hardware up to speed too (we hope), which should give it a stronger fighting chance. The Magic V5, on the other hand, comes with some impressive camera hardware on paper, like a 50MP main sensor, 64MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom, and a 50MP ultrawide. Even the selfie cameras on the outer and inner screens are 20MP each, which is higher than what Google might offer.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-pro-fold-vs-honor-magic-v5-software-2">Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold vs. Honor Magic V5: Software</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="xbrBEuPwP6RdkBtdUXNfmF" name="android-16-qpr-beta-1-multi-tasking-menu-pixel-9-pro-fold" alt="New multi-tasking context menu in Android 16 QPR1 Beta 1 on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xbrBEuPwP6RdkBtdUXNfmF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Pixel 10 Pro Fold should ship with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> and would also get seven years of software updates, which would include OS upgrades and security patches. Meanwhile, the Magic V5 runs MagicOS 9, which is based on Android 15. It's unclear how many OS revisions this phone will receive over the years. In terms of staying up to date with software, the Pixel is always going to be a safer choice.</p><p>The Magic V5 runs Gemini and comes with its own custom AI suite. There's AI Call Translation and AI Deepfake Detection, and Honor Share, which works with even iOS and Mac devices. Along with Gemini, there's Honor's own AI assistant called YONO, although this might be exclusive to the Chinese version of the phone.</p><p>We don't know yet what exclusive AI features will be offered with the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, but rest assured that there will be many. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold debuted new features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-add-me-google-pixel-9">Add Me</a> and Video Boost, which will come to the Pixel 10 Pro Fold too, along with new exclusives.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-pro-fold-vs-honor-magic-v5-which-one-should-you-buy-2">Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold vs. Honor Magic V5: Which one should you buy?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="HnU2kNU89MB96UTR7mPE6W" name="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review-1.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold back" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HnU2kNU89MB96UTR7mPE6W.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold is probably going to be a safer buy for most users. The wide availability, strong after-sales support, and long-term software update commitment are going to be the biggest reasons you should choose this over the Honor Magic V5. The promise of better performance and improved cameras would be nice too, and we'll know for sure what we're getting when it launches on August 20.</p><p>The Honor Magic V5 is an engineering marvel and is certainly on the cutting edge of foldable tech. It should cost roughly the same as the Pixel when it does launch in more markets, but before snagging one, keep in mind that long-term software support, AI features, and serviceability probably won't be as good as the Pixel.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="893e4499-b5fd-4b6c-b0b5-9db8977c62a3">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6XUdMt74rbUjvCdi83z3Nf.jpg' alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold Official Render - Porcelain - Folded"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>More refined</strong></em></p><p>The Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold is coming in August, and it's going to have some big upgrades over the 9 Pro Fold.

Let's review how these two <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">great smartwatches</a> might compare based on current rumors and leaks.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-watch-4-vs-samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic-pricing-and-availability-2">Google Pixel Watch 4 vs. Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic: Pricing and availability </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="vEBkN4jNP5ezATouUpFS88" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-vs-Watch-6-Classic-design" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic (left) and Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic (right) sitting aside one another, the photo angled to focus on their rotating bezels and thickness from the bottom-up." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vEBkN4jNP5ezATouUpFS88.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/made-by-google-2025-how-to-watch-pixel-10-launch-and-what-to-expect">Made by Google event set for August 20</a>, and that's where we'll see the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Google Pixel Watch 4</a> for the first time. The smartwatch will debut alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Google Pixel 10 series</a> and a new Pixel Buds model. It's expected to be released in two sizes, and the Pixel Watch 4 may follow the same pricing tiers as the Pixel Watch 3.</p><p>In case you're curious, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> was announced on August 13, 2024, but you couldn't buy it until September 10, 2024. It's unclear how much time will pass between the Pixel Watch 4's official announcement and public release date this time around, with rumors pointing to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/report-allege-pixel-10-pro-fold-pixel-watch-4-shipping-delays-issues">another long delay this year</a>.</p><p>A recent leak suggested that there won't be a price hike for the Pixel Watch 4 in Europe, and that should be music to everyone's ears. If pricing remains the same globally, you'll pay $349 for the 41mm model and $399 for the 45mm model. LTE versions would cost another $100 on top of that. It's always possible that Google raises the price due to inflation and other supply chain factors, but early signs are positive.</p><p>Samsung released the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic-review">Galaxy Watch 8 Classic</a> on July 25, and it's now publicly available. It's only available in one 46mm case size that retails for $499. That's more than the previous Galaxy Watch 6 Classic. It's also priced higher than rumors expect the Pixel Watch 4 to cost. You can get the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic in white or black colorways.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-watch-4-vs-samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic-design-and-display-2">Google Pixel Watch 4 vs. Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4WQK9PfiUyFYyQ45s8mKLe" name="Pixel-Watch-renders-01" alt="Pixel Watch 4 renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4WQK9PfiUyFYyQ45s8mKLe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks/ via 91mobiles)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung and Google now both have their own unique smartwatch design languages. It'll be up to you to decide which one you prefer. Google has the "waterdrop" chassis for the Pixel Watch, where the display glass flows right into the case like a water droplet. Meanwhile, Samsung is sticking with the "cushion" shape for the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic, where you get a circular display atop a squircle case.</p><p>Regardless of how you feel about each style, there's no doubt they're distinct. Google is expected to keep the same general design language on the Pixel Watch 4, albeit with slimmer bezels. Rumors point to the Google Pixel Watch 4 being thicker than the Pixel Watch 3, possibly by about 2 millimeters. That could put the Pixel Watch 4 above 14mm thick, which is somewhat alarming — the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic is only 10.6mm thick.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="JJvqnaStEhfDsFrJVNRjL8" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-Heritage-Classic-watch-face" alt="A close-up of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic on a woman's wrist showing the Heritage Classic watch face." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JJvqnaStEhfDsFrJVNRjL8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That's true even after accounting for the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic's physical rotating bezel. It's used for navigation, giving users a satisfying way to control the watch while limiting the number of display touches needed for each action.</p><p>Notably, if you like a smaller watch, you'll probably need to go with the upcoming Pixel Watch 4. Samsung did away with offering the Classic watch in multiple sizes; the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic has a 46mm case size. Google does a better job supporting multiple sizes, and the Pixel Watch 4 could come in 41mm and 45mm cases, just like its predecessor.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="e3PYr2agAyyZbgGq7Ajey4" name="Pixel-Watch-renders-04" alt="Pixel Watch 4 renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e3PYr2agAyyZbgGq7Ajey4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks/ via 91mobiles)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Believe it or not, the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic's display size is expected to fall right in the middle of the Pixel Watch 4 size options. Samsung's watch sports a 1.34-inch Super AMOLED screen with a 438x438 resolution, and it now supports a 3,000-nit peak brightness rating. The squircle chassis and rotating bezel take up a lot of space; thus, the larger case size actually has a smaller screen.</p><p>The rumored 45mm size of the Google Pixel Watch 4 should pack a bigger display measuring around 1.43 inches. If the company is indeed slimming the bezels, the screen could be even larger. On the smaller variant, there may be a display measuring roughly 1.27 inches. Both AMOLED screens should support at least a 2,000-nit peak brightness rating and offer a 60Hz variable refresh rate.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-watch-4-vs-samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic-hardware-and-specs-2">Google Pixel Watch 4 vs. Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="xCUdrNg2eUs9U7VvHkncuK" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-post-workout" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic showing the post-run results from a track workout." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xCUdrNg2eUs9U7VvHkncuK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On the inside, both Wear OS smartwatches are likely packed with wearable processors and a slew of health sensors. Samsung just updated its watches with new BioActive sensors and Exynos W1000 processors last year, and they both carry over to the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic. Google may be due for an upgrade, and there are rumors that the Pixel Watch 4 could be powered by a new Qualcomm chipset for wearables, but it's unclear if one will be ready in time.</p><p>That mysterious processor is expected to be the Qualcomm Snapdragon W5 Gen 2, a chip that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/qualcomms-next-wear-os-chipset-could-arrive-in-2025">recently started appearing in leaks</a>. Previously, our own wearable expert Michael Hicks <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/qualcomms-next-wear-os-chipset-could-arrive-in-2025">spoke to Qualcomm VP of wearables Dino Bekis</a> about the partnership between Qualcomm and Google. At the time, Bekis teased the "feature-focused" and "AI-driven" Snapdragon Wear chipset set to arrive "next year" (2025).</p><p>It would stand to reason that a new Snapdragon W5 Gen 2 platform is coming, and the Pixel Watch 4 could be one of the first wearables to use it. Google could ship the Pixel Watch 4 with 2GB of memory and 32GB of storage, aligning with prior models. However, Samsung bumped up the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic's onboard storage to 64GB this year, keeping the memory at 2GB.</p><div ><table><caption>Rumored specifications</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Specs</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel Watch 4 (rumored/expected)</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Obsidian, Gold, Lemon, Porcelain, Iris, and Moonstone</p></td><td  ><p>Black, White</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Materials</p></td><td  ><p>Recycled aluminum</p></td><td  ><p>Stainless Steel & Sapphire Crystal</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Band</p></td><td  ><p>Active (fluoroelastomer)</p></td><td  ><p>Hybrid</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>Unknown, possibly 14.3mm thick</p></td><td  ><p>46.4mm x 46mm x 10.6 mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight (w/out band)</p></td><td  ><p>Unknown</p></td><td  ><p>63.5g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Protection</p></td><td  ><p>Corning Gorilla Glass 5, 5ATM, IP68</p></td><td  ><p>5ATM water resistance, IP68 & MIL-STD-810H certification</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>1.27-inch (408x408) or 1.43-inch (456x456) Actua AMOLED LTPO display</p></td><td  ><p>1.34-inch Super AMOLED, 438x438 pixels resolution</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol empty" ></td><td  ><p>2,000 nits, 60Hz refresh rate</p></td><td  ><p>3,000 nits, 60Hz refresh rate</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Bluetooth 5.3, Wi-Fi 2.4/5GHz, NFC, UWB, LTE (upgrade), GPS, Galileo, Glonass, (ROW) Beidou, QZSS, Navic</p></td><td  ><p>LTE (optional), Bluetooth 5.3, Wi-Fi 2.4+5GHz, NFC, L1+L5 dual-frequency GPS, Glonass, Galileo, Beidou</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Sensors</p></td><td  ><p>Multi-path optical HR sensor, red & IR sensors for SpO2, multipurpose electrical (ECG), electrical skin conductance for body response (cEDA), skin temperature, accelerometer, altimeter, ambient light, barometer, compass, gyroscope, magnetometer</p></td><td  ><p>BioActive sensor (Optical + Electrical Heart Signal + BIA), Temperature, Accelerometer, Barometer, Gyro, Geomagnetic, Light, 3D Hall</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>306mAh/420mAh</p></td><td  ><p>445mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging</p></td><td  ><p>Unknown</p></td><td  ><p>Fast Charging (WPC-based wireless)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>CPU</p></td><td  ><p>Snapdragon W5 Gen 1 (or Gen 2)</p></td><td  ><p>Exynos W1000</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Memory / Storage</p></td><td  ><p>2GB + 32GB</p></td><td  ><p>2GB + 64GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>Wear OS 6</p></td><td  ><p>Wear OS 6 (One UI 8 Watch) with four years of software updates through 2029</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Battery capacity is expected to remain the same between the Pixel Watch 3 and the Pixel Watch 4, with the 41mm model landing somewhere around 306mAh and the 45mm reaching roughly 420mAh.

It's using a One UI 8 Watch skin, so the entire operating system will feel familiar if you're a One UI user. In addition to Gemini, you'll also get Galaxy AI and Samsung Health integration on the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic.</p><p>The new model includes a few new health tricks, like tracking your antioxidant index and serving as your custom Running Coach. The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic also includes now-standard features like heart rate monitoring, ECG support, blood-oxygen monitoring, and temperature detection. Basically, the BioActive sensor here will have all your health and sleep tracking needs covered.</p><p>Google will likely ship the Pixel Watch 4 with Wear OS 6 and Gemini support, too. It should also bring along the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-unveils-the-most-massive-android-redesign-ever">Material 3 Expressive redesign</a>, something that's exclusive to Pixel wearables.

Slimmer bezels, a new processor, and more battery life would be massive upgrades for the Pixel Watch 4. Google AI and Gemini tools tailor-made for the Pixel Watch could change the way you interact with the device on your wrist.</p><p>Rumors and leaks paint a lofty picture, but we'll have to wait for the Google Pixel Watch 4 to be officially revealed to know for sure. The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic is certainly the more well-known quantity, as it already sports Wear OS 6 and Gemini.

And now, we might know when the Galaxy S25 FE is set to debut.</p><p>According to a report by Korean outlet <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="www.fnnews.com/news/202508031104025767" target="_blank">FNNews</a>, Samsung will launch the Galaxy S25 FE in Korea on September 19, 2025. While the report didn't mention release dates for global markets, if Samsung follows its usual pattern, the Galaxy S25 FE should launch internationally around the same date.</p><h2 id="september-19-could-be-an-exciting-day-for-samsung-fans-2">September 19 could be an exciting day for Samsung fans</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wtxvdX499hQ8iyMTHK6Yj4" name="samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-mint-1.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy S24 FE mint" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wtxvdX499hQ8iyMTHK6Yj4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The report also says that the Galaxy S25 FE will retain a starting price below 1 million won (~$720), with no price increase currently planned. Like other Fan Edition phones, it will offer key flagship features from the main S series lineup, but at a more affordable price.</p><p>Samsung is reportedly targeting an earlier-than-usual launch due to concerns over U.S. tariffs. The company also appears to be capitalizing on the strong momentum of the Galaxy S25 series in its home market. Launching a cheaper model now could help Samsung attract even more customers.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/massive-galaxy-s25-fe-leak-highlights-extensive-specs-before-launch">Previous leaks</a> indicate that the Galaxy S25 FE will be powered by Samsung's own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-exynos-will-be-just-fine">Exynos 2400 processor</a>, the same chip used in some Galaxy S24 models across regions like Asia and Europe.

The Galaxy S24 FE was 8mm thick, but the S25 FE will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s25-fe-leak-shows-a-design-youve-definitely-seen-before">reportedly measure just 7.4mm</a>. The weight will also drop from 213g to 190g.</p><p>However, this slimming down will come at a cost, with the battery reportedly being reduced from 4,700mAh to 4,500mAh.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The agents are available in preview starting today, Aug. 5, including a GitHub Actions helper for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-cli-debuts-open-source-ai-agent">Gemini command-line interface (CLI)</a>.</p><p>The company says the fresh AI tools are the start of an agentic enterprise for its customers, which aims to bridge the operational and analytical needs of a business. Alongside the agentic helpers, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-is-giving-openai-more-computing-power-to-keep-up-with-everyones-ai-cravings">Google Cloud</a> is creating Gemini Data Agents APIs and the Agent Development Kit (ADK), which are the foundation for a customizable platform that can be used to create custom AI tools for unique workflows.</p><p>These are the new AI agents developers and businesses can try out now in Google Cloud:</p><ul><li><strong>Data Engineering Agent in BigQuery</strong> — a data-prepping agent optimized for cleaning, transforming, and preparing information for AI use.</li><li><strong>Data Science Agent in BigQuery Notebooks</strong> — a workspace agent that turns notebooks into intelligent infrastructure for data science teams.</li><li><strong>Conversational Analytics Agent + Code Interpreter</strong> — a chatbot-style tool that supports conversational question-and-answer dialogue using the context of unique data sets.</li><li><strong>Migration Agent for Spanner </strong>— a data modernization agent designed for Google Cloud's global database service, Spanner.</li><li><strong>Conversational Analytics API</strong> — a custom agent builder for developers and businesses.</li><li><strong>Gemini CLI GitHub Actions</strong> — a coding teammate for your GitHub repository, found in Gemini CLI.</li></ul><h2 id="everything-you-need-to-know-about-google-s-new-ai-agents-2">Everything you need to know about Google's new AI agents</h2><p>Google Cloud is for businesses, first-and-foremost, and these AI agents are intended to help with everything from software development and data analytics to managing global distribution and infrastructure networks. For example, the Data Engineering Agent can automate workflows that were once manual processes. It supports data ingestion from external sources, like Google Cloud Storage, and can complete contextual actions on your behalf.</p><p>Google provides the example prompt of "Create a pipeline to load a CSV file, cleanse these columns, and join it with another table." With that, the Data Engineering Agent can complete the multi-action requests independently. The Spanner Migration Agent can work in tandem with the Data Engineering Agent, as it's intended for legacy systems that are still needing modernization.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2444px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:45.34%;"><img id="vy9A6Sq8X4e83VJDSvix5A" name="Google-Data-Science-Agent" alt="The data science agent in Google Cloud." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vy9A6Sq8X4e83VJDSvix5A.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2444" height="1108" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Data Science Agent can automate typical analytical workflows, according to Google.

It receives thorough and specific natural language questions, and automatically converts them into Python code. From there, Code Interpreter can run the generated code, creating visual and interactive graphics based on the results. It's all running in Google Data Cloud, and thus the company claims it's secure and governed.</p><h2 id="gemini-cli-is-getting-better-for-teams-with-github-actions-2">Gemini CLI is getting better for teams with GitHub Actions</h2><p>Finally, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> CLI is getting an upgrade that enhances multi-user support and GitHub integration. For those unfamiliar, Gemini CLI is a command-line terminal for Gemini that's open-source and can be run locally. It's available in beta globally now on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/google-github-actions/run-gemini-cli" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p><p>The story behind Gemini CLI's new GitHub Actions agent is pretty interesting. Amidst a heavy burden of GitHub feature requests and contributions for the open-source Gemini CLI, Google needed a way to respond quickly at scale. So, it created GitHub Actions — an autonomous agent that can handle issue triage and pull request reviews independently. Now, it's giving away what it created to manage Gemini CLI issues and contributions as GitHub Actions.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:923px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:58.50%;"><img id="q4gu89pgDnnY9pftiMga5F" name="Looker MCP Server + Gemini CLI" alt="GitHub Actions running in Gemini CLI." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/q4gu89pgDnnY9pftiMga5F.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="923" height="540" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Aside from issue triage and pulling request reviews, GitHub Actions also serves as a collaborative coding agent that can work as your AI teammate.</p><p>All of these Google Cloud features are available in preview or beta starting today, and you can try them now.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The screen was fast enough to run all my normal apps, and the processor was even fast enough to play modern games. The only problem was that, while it was the size of a phone, it didn't have support for SIM cards, so it was ultimately just a tiny Kindle in disguise.</p><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Android Central Labs</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7WCXSEZSk3FX9EmxxzaGE9" name="android-central-labs-lloyd-logo.jpg" caption="" alt="Android Central's Lloyd mascot wearing a lab coat for the Android Central Labs column" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7WCXSEZSk3FX9EmxxzaGE9.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/android-central-labs">Android Central Labs</a> is a weekly column devoted to deep dives, experiments, and a focused look into the tech you use. It covers phones, tablets, and everything in between.</p></div></div><p>While Onyx released a follow-up device <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/boox-palma-2-note-air4-c-launch-details">a year later</a>, it still didn't include SIM support. Thankfully, Bigme has answered the call and created the HiBreak Pro, a device that not only is the same size as the Palma but also features an <em>even better</em> E Ink display, haptic motors, and, most importantly, a dual-SIM tray.</p><p>While most E Ink phones seem to focus on being "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/rise-in-minimalist-phones">minimalist phones</a>," the Bigme HiBreak Pro tosses that idea in the trash and, instead, works exactly like the Android phone you're probably already using. The big difference is that it has a Kindle-like E Ink display that makes daily reading a joy. Plus, it's so much easier on your eyes since you can turn the backlight completely off with the click of a button.</p><p>I took the HiBreak Pro on vacation with me last week and have continued using it for an additional couple of days, and I still can't believe this phone is real. It's a dream come true for anyone trying to avoid the negative effects of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a> or is just trying to get away from staring at a backlit screen all day, all without trying to take away all the apps and experiences you love on your smartphone.</p><h2 id="different-from-the-rest-2">Different from the rest</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JkH9VaYNStqK5iEcU7j93n" name="e-ink-phones-bigme-hibreak-pro-minimal-phone-mudita-kompakt" alt="A Mudita Kompakt, Minimal Phone, and Bigme HiBreak Pro next to each other on a white table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JkH9VaYNStqK5iEcU7j93n.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I've used several E Ink phones up until now, and all of them seem to suffer from one big issue or another. I compared the Minimal Phone and the Mudita Kompakt <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/an-e-ink-phone-isnt-something-you-just-switch-to-in-one-day">back in April</a> because both phones aim to provide a more minimalist experience to cure your digital addiction. While this is admirable, it's extraordinarily difficult for many people to stop using apps, social media, NFC payments, and other modern necessities.</p><p>I say 'necessities' because, try as I might, someone like me can't use a minimalist phone daily and still perform my job effectively. If you fall into this category but still want the eye-friendly experience created by an E Ink display, the Bigme HiBreak Pro is your only viable option on the market. That sounds like you'll be compromising, but the reality is that you really won't.</p><p>The only real "downside" to the phone is that the display is black and white only. It doesn't use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/bigme-b1051c-pro-color-e-ink-tablet-impressions">color E Ink</a> like some of Bigme's other devices, although that version is supposedly in the works for a later release. Instead, it uses a lovely 6.13-inch E Ink screen with a very fast refresh rate; <em>much </em>faster than the one on the Minimal Phone or Mudita Kompakt, and it makes a world of difference in daily use.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="tUiuRrSDyPXeQinQa7S8q9" name="bigme-hibreak-pro-youtube-video" alt="Watching a Zelda Tears of the Kingdom video on the YouTube app, running on a Bigme HiBreak Pro E Ink phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tUiuRrSDyPXeQinQa7S8q9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Watching videos on a black and white screen is a bit strange, but people did it less than a hundred years ago, so it just takes some getting used to. Even the contrast is good enough for most videos, although darker videos are just plain hard to see on any E Ink device I've used to date.</p><p>Apps and all normal smartphone functions work as you would expect. Want to launch the camera quickly? Double-click the power button and take the shot. Want to toggle the backlight so you're not wasting power during the day?

Most modern E Ink devices do a decent job in the default display mode, but a lot of apps require you to tweak the image to get the best picture.</p><p>So far, I've <em>never</em> had to adjust the display mode on the Bigme HiBreak Pro. It understands how to tune it for the app that's running, and that's been a huge quality of life change I didn't expect. The only thing I adjust manually is the brightness level because I like control over the backlight, but even then, you could just set it to automatic and let it do its thing like normal.</p><p>Compared to every other E Ink device I have, this one rarely has to do that jarring full refresh cycle you probably associate with E Ink devices.

Once again, Bigme surprises in the best way, and I find typing to be a great experience.</p><h2 id="specs-value-and-conclusion-2">Specs, value, and conclusion</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ebrCGh6TDq7zcbwVEwJ6CD" name="bigme-hibreak-pro-back" alt="The back of the Bigme HiBreak Pro E Ink smartphone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ebrCGh6TDq7zcbwVEwJ6CD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Bigme HiBreak Pro is quite affordable, retailing for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Bigme-HiBreak-Epaper-Phone-Android/dp/B0FBW5QMPN/"><strong>$459 on Amazon</strong></a>.

I tried to use the phone without this case for a while, but found it to be way too slippery. Thankfully, Bigme includes a silicone case in the box if you don't like the overly slippery plastic build. This case is extremely grippy and offers some decent padding for the device, which further adds to the value of the package.</p><p>While a fully polycarbonate phone sounds like a negative, I actually enjoyed the fact that there's zero possibility of breaking the screen if you drop it. That's a weirdly freeing reality in a world where most phones are some kind of metal and glass sandwich.</p><p>Overall, I <em>loved</em> using this phone and even found that, even while Bigme doesn't market this as a "minimalist phone," per se, the black & white E Ink display swayed me away from mindless scrolling I'm seldom prone to doing. To me, this is the ideal way to switch to an E Ink device without feeling the shellshock most other similar products create.</p><p>And, if you were wondering, yes, this display is completely flicker-free. No PWM dimming. No <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-users-have-had-just-about-enough-of-temporal-dithering">temporal dithering</a>.

One can only speculate, but I've been working in this industry long enough that I can give you a pretty good idea of what to expect in the coming weeks. Let's discuss. </p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-we-know"><span>What we know</span></h3><p>Like I mentioned above, the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold is likely to be revealed during an announcement event on August 20th with a keynote address scheduled for 10am PT. </p><p>Alongside the foldable, we're also set to get a first look at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Google Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro</a>, plus Google is expected to announce the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Pixel Watch 4</a> and Pixel Buds 2A. Some rumors have even suggested that the company will be formally announcing the release of its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/my-demo-with-googles-ar-glasses-went-better-than-the-one-on-stage">long-teased AR smart glasses</a>, but the validity of that rumor is far from certain. </p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="FgLGN6ffKxpzHiEBeJY7qF" name="android-16-qpr-beta-1-home-screen-pixel-9-pro-fold-2" alt="Android 16 QPR1 Beta 1 home screen on Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FgLGN6ffKxpzHiEBeJY7qF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As for specs, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is rumored to feature a 6.4-inch OLED cover display with an 8-inch OLED inner display. Both screens are expected to boast 3,000 nits of peak brightness, plus Google is reportedly working on a new-and-improved hinge that should make the phone a bit thinner and nicer to hold. Considering the ultra-sleek new design found on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> (the Fold's biggest competitor), this is probably a smart move on Google's part. </p><p>Under the hood, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is expected to sport the same Tensor G5 chipset that the Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro/10 Pro XL will use, plus rumors have suggested that the phone will feature an upgraded 5,015mAh battery. You'll also get 16GB of RAM as standard and storage variants up to 1TB. We're also expecting the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a> to come with IP68 ingress protection, which would be an industry first!</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7rjDMuoASB4nmdPX5tR2p7" name="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review-11.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold with Pixel Watch 3 and Pixel Buds Pro 2 in leaves" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7rjDMuoASB4nmdPX5tR2p7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>So what about the price? Well, looking at the competition, it's worth mentioning that both of Samsung's new foldable phones received considerable price increases, with the Galaxy Z Fold 7 clocking in at a ridiculous $1,999.99. Last year's Pixel 9 Pro Fold, on the other hand, had a starting price of $1,799.99.</p><p>Will Google follow the way of its competitors and up the price of the Pixel 10 series? It's hard to know for sure, but at least <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/could-we-be-the-reason-for-google-increasing-its-phone-prices">one rumor</a> has suggested that Google might actually <em>decrease </em>the starting price of its flagship foldable by $200. Only time will tell, but I wouldn't start celebrating just yet. </p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-will-the-pixel-9-pro-fold-get-a-price-drop"><span>Will the Pixel 9 Pro Fold get a price drop?</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="FdQPMvzaW7dKx6bnWfZJTP" name="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review-7.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold on table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FdQPMvzaW7dKx6bnWfZJTP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Now for the million-dollar question: <strong>will the Pixel 9 Pro Fold finally get cheaper when the next generation arrives?</strong> Since there's no way to know for certain, we have to look at the past to make an educated guess.</p><p>The phone that came before the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold was simply called the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a>. This foldable dropped in 2023 with a $1,799 price tag, and although it's a little hard to find nowadays, you can actually buy the Google Pixel Fold for as little as $989.99 nowadays through stores like Amazon and Best Buy. But of course, this is nearly three years after the device's launch, and I'm guessing you'd rather not wait that long to pick up the Pixel 9 Pro Fold.</p><p>Instead, I'd recommend waiting for a major sale event, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/back-to-school-your-ultimate-shopping-guide">Back to School 2025</a> or the upcoming Black Friday sales. By that time, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold will be considered last-gen, but most stores will still have stock that they're looking to ditch. After all, at this very moment you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-5g-256gb-unlocked-obsidian/6587911.p"><strong>get $500 off the phone at Best Buy</strong></a>, and the Pixel 10 version hasn't even been announced yet. Give it a few more weeks and I wouldn't be surprised if last year's foldable dropped to $1,000 or less. </p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="5efc47ab-f503-445f-a7d7-dc9e79d7b75d">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JissherrZpkPfUPoRgiLgn.jpg' alt="google pixel 9 pro fold square render 1"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The Pixel experience in a foldable package</strong></em></p><p>Although it's about to be supplanted by a newer model, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is still an impressive device with two glorious 120Hz OLED displays, a solid Tensor chipset, and outstanding battery life.

This feature is rolling out globally on computers and phones, letting users "describe any story you can imagine" and receive a 10-page storybook in return. Users don't just have to rely on their words with Gemini, as Google states, you can use a variety of external materials to help the AI see what you have in mind.</p><p>For example, Google says users can use their memories as fuel for Gemini. If you've got photos of a recent trip on your device, users can upload them to Gemini to tell it to create a story from that. Similarly, if you've got a little one, you can snap a picture of their drawing, too.</p><p>Google states users can tell Gemini that the photo is of their child's drawing and to create a storybook that "brings his/her drawing to life." If you're interested, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gemini.google.com/share/3727e49b234d">here's an example</a> of one such story created with Gemini.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TiYQadKvhGs" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Additionally, Google says parents can use Gemini's AI storybook creation to help their child or children understand complex topics or lessons, such as sharing.</p><p>Gemini's storybooks are outfitted with narration capabilities, meaning you'll have an AI voice to read your story aloud. It's perfect for those nights when you're far too tired. Parents can also share their stories or print them out, so your little one can ask you to read them again and again and again.</p><p>Google states this update is rolling out today (Aug 5), and that you can try it out. We've tested this out, and it seems available for the most part. "Storybook" is marked as an experiment right now, so keep that in mind when using it.</p><h2 id="gemini-advances-2">Gemini Advances</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:972px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.35%;"><img id="jkxE46dT4yPjLn9EDMVNXX" name="google-gemini-storybook-ai-creation-ask-example" alt="An example of asking Gemini if it can create a storybook, to which it replies "yes" and asks for the reader's age, the story's plot, and more." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jkxE46dT4yPjLn9EDMVNXX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="972" height="538" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nickolas Diaz / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Gemini's most recent (and substantial) update was in mid-July when Google introduced its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-2-5-flash-lite-generally-available-fastest-cost-efficient-series-version">2.5 Flash-Lite model</a>. After spending a month in "preview," the 2.5 Flash-Lite model arrived as Google's most cost-efficient version of Gemini. This update mainly focused on developers, as Google announced devs could find $0.10 per 1M token input and $0.40 for output.</p><p>Companies got in on the 2.5 Flash-Lite variant, as well, revealing that it's helped cut down on processing satellite telemetry and more. In short, this updated version of Flash is much lighter, meaning its processing should be speedy for math, coding, science, and such topics. Google states this model strikes a balance between speed and power, though other version of Gemini holds a little more power for more complex topics.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It's alleged "sources" state that Google will delay the market availability of the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, Pixel Watch 4, and Pixel Buds 2a by roughly two months. That paints an October picture for consumers interested in using those devices.</p><p>The publication adds that Google has reportedly run into "supply chain issues," and nothing more than that was said.</p><p>While the rumor suggests consumers should look toward early October for the previously mentioned devices, that theory seems to regard when your shipment should arrive. It looks like consumers can still pre-order the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, Pixel Watch 4, and Pixel Buds 2a after Google's event on August 20. It's just the wait to receive them that's going to be daunting, if this is true.</p><p>It seems as though this "delay" will affect all consumers, and it's not just region locked. Again, we're missing some context here, so we'll have to see what the Made by Google event holds later this month officially. The publication claims the other devices, the main Google Pixel 10 series, are on schedule.</p><h2 id="the-event-s-coming-up-2">The event's coming up</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="srNCFV47V4GVdhvZkNZ3km" name="google-pixel-watch-3-porcelain-on-stands-4.jpg" alt="Pixel Watch 3 41mm and 45mm with Porcelain bands" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/srNCFV47V4GVdhvZkNZ3km.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The folks at 9to5 thought back to the Pixel 9 series launch, which saw the base and Pro XL models ship in August, right after the event. However, everything else was scattered throughout September. While shipping delays have happened before, this alleged two-month wait (especially for Google's newest smartwatch) seems extreme.</p><p>The rumor is food for thought right now, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-teaser-roasts-apple-for-dragging-its-feet-on-siri">we've got another official Google teaser</a> to get us excited. The company posted a teaser for its Pixel 10 yesterday (Aug 4), which also threw shade at Apple. Google mocked Apple's sluggish progression toward Siri's big AI upgrade, which was previously promised for the iPhone 16. Since that has yet to arrive, Google says "just change your phone," with a not-so-subtle wink toward the Pixel 10 series.</p><p>Also, a recent Pixel Watch 4 rumor claims the device <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/turns-out-the-pixel-watch-4s-price-tag-isnt-half-bad">might not see a price boost</a>. Consumers might see a $349 and $399 price tag for its 41mm and 45mm sizes, respectively, just like in 2024. A surprising note is that the LTE model could drop by ~$50, which consumers might like.</p><p>Google's upcoming event is slated for August 20, where we will see its Pixel 10 series, Pixel Watch 4, Pixel Buds 2a, and more revealed.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Nothing starts with an update for "Flip-to-Record," stating users can now save their audio recordings or share them via texts and other platforms.</p><p>After finishing a recording, users can head to the three-dot menu of its overview and tap "Share." A new "Recording" option will be present, and tapping it will display a "Share" and "Save" button.</p><p>Nothing's example shows users should find convenient options, like Google Drive, Android's Quick Share, Discord (a messaging app), and more.</p><p>The second update concerns <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/how-use-nothing-essential-space">Essential Space's</a> "Memories." The post states users can export their captured content as an image, a PDF, or a Markdown file. There is something to note with this: while your captured content enables you to save it with a voice recording, the sharing function will not include that clip. Instead, when sharing a memory with others, Essential Space will create a snapshot of it.</p><p>You'll find the image you took at the top, with Essential Space's title for it and your audio file's transcription.</p><h2 id="nothing-os-2">Nothing OS</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:637px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:94.19%;"><img id="BciLgdGenfxe27jjpicMMY" name="nothing-essential-space-recording-sharing" alt="Users can now share an audio recording through Nothing OS latest update." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BciLgdGenfxe27jjpicMMY.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="637" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nothing)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:568px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:105.63%;"><img id="Rbz77E5emahSSUJ8LPrdKX" name="nothing-essential-space-memories-sharing" alt="Nothing's newest update lets users share "Memories" as an image, PDF, or a Markdown file." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Rbz77E5emahSSUJ8LPrdKX.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="568" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nothing)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>While these updates should be automatically downloaded to your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-phone-3-review">Phone 3</a>, Nothing states you can also manually install it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nothing.ntessentialspace&hl=en_GB">via the Play Store</a> when available.</p><p>This is the second update to Essential Space <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/nothings-essential-space-just-got-with-google-calendar-sync-and-more">in the past couple of weeks</a>. The first brought a little more intelligence to Nothing's AI suite via "Editable Memory." The feature was the company's newest AI-powered capability that will learn about its users' preferences to provide better reviews and summaries. Moreover, the Essential Recorder was on the receiving end of a similar sharing function update, like Flip-to-Record.</p><p>Nothing also rolled in support for Google Calendar when syncing your to-do lists.</p><p>What most users are probably keeping their eye on is Nothing's OS 4.0 update, which is Android 16.

The platform is tightening up its defenses against shady group invites, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-beta-prepares-optional-link-preview">sketchy messages</a>, and pyramid schemes disguised as quick cash gigs.</p><p>To tackle these threats, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whatsapp">WhatsApp</a> is experimenting with a feature that alerts you when a stranger drops you into a group. You’ll see key details, like who created the group and how many members are in it, before deciding whether to bail or stick around. Notifications stay muted until you confirm you want to stay.</p><p>For one-on-one chats, WhatsApp is also experimenting with warnings when messaging someone not in your contacts, adding extra context to help you decide if the conversation is legit.</p><h2 id="mass-account-purge-2">Mass account purge</h2><p>The Meta-owned platform says that in the first half of this year alone, WhatsApp booted over 6.8 million accounts linked to scam centers. Most of these are run by organized crime groups in Southeast Asia, often using forced labor. The cybercriminals are said to be using a mix of crypto bait, get-rich-quick schemes, and fake investment deals, all engineered to look just convincing enough to catch people off guard.</p><p>Scam campaigns now stretch across multiple platforms, sometimes all in one hit. A recent case linked to a scam center in Cambodia started with AI-generated messages created using ChatGPT, lured people into WhatsApp, and then quickly shuffled them off to Telegram and TikTok for bogus “paid” tasks. Victims were eventually asked to deposit money into a crypto wallet.</p><p>This kind of multi-app hopscotch isn’t random. It’s a deliberate strategy to stay under the radar by giving each platform only a tiny glimpse of what’s going on. It’s also one reason Meta, OpenAI, and other tech players are teaming up more often to share intelligence and cut off these scams before they snowball.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:87.08%;"><img id="xdzPRc82wt4p6tyTL22YeE" name="WhatsApp-scam-tips" alt="WhatsApp tips for fighting off scams" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xdzPRc82wt4p6tyTL22YeE.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1672" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WhatsApp)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:87.08%;"><img id="EpXajNqzrCEJmgZK8RDKgE" name="WhatsApp-scam-tips" alt="WhatsApp tips for fighting off scams" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EpXajNqzrCEJmgZK8RDKgE.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1672" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WhatsApp)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:87.08%;"><img id="Xxg5vRChmQz5rRfC6G35iE" name="WhatsApp-scam-tips" alt="WhatsApp tips for fighting off scams" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Xxg5vRChmQz5rRfC6G35iE.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1672" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WhatsApp)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>WhatsApp notes that scams usually start with something that seems harmless: a text, a job offer, maybe a DM about a lost package or unpaid bill.</p><p>The platform recommends taking a pause before replying to unfamiliar numbers, questioning any requests that sound urgent, and verifying who’s really on the other end.

That's where the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-tablets/lenovo-chromebook-duet-11-review">Lenovo Duet 11 Chromebook</a> comes into the picture.</p><p>A lot of primary education institutions provide a Chromebook for students to use throughout the year, but if you're off to college or your kid's school doesn't offer its own Chromebook program, you need to take a look.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-pros"><span>The Pros</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="d5iqP2qC44iyxdNakiEHpn" name="lenovo-chromebook-duet-11-hands-on-5.jpg" alt="Side view of Lenovo Chromebook Duet 11" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/d5iqP2qC44iyxdNakiEHpn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Lenovo Duet 11 isn't the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">best Chromebook</a> you can buy, but there are a few things that make it a standout for a student.</p><p><strong>The Lenovo Duet 11 is super portable. </strong>As a convertible tablet and laptop, the Lenovo Duet 11 is thin, light, and easy to stuff into a backpack so you can lug it around all day.</p><p><strong>It promises up to 12 hours of battery life</strong> and mostly delivers. The battery on this thing will last all day and well into a night of homework. Recharging it is simple with a good USB charger.</p><p><strong>It runs Chrome OS</strong>. This is a bigger deal than you may think because Chrome OS was designed to run well on even the most modest hardware. It's also a great way to tie into any online Google services and will sync directly with your Google Drive if that's how you want to go.</p><p><strong>It has a surprisingly good display</strong>. The 11-inch 1080p display is bright and easy on the eyes. That's something most cheap Chromebooks can't offer.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-cons"><span>The Cons</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vz7A9nWEFHin3RWcDPi8ra" name="microsd-card-01" alt="A microSD card on a fingertip" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vz7A9nWEFHin3RWcDPi8ra.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>The Lenovo Duet 11 only has 4GB of memory</strong>. To be fair, that's enough to do anything a Chromebook is capable of doing, but it can struggle when trying to do more than one task at a time. You aren't going to want to have 100 Chrome tabs open on this thing.</p><p><strong>It only has 128GB of storage</strong>. That might be enough for some people, but it won't be enough for others. The thing is, you can never change that number. You get 128GB no matter what.</p><p><strong>It has no SD card slot</strong>. Combined with the limited storage, this means you are going to have to juggle what you store on your Duet 11 Chromebook. No dropping that huge music collection on it.</p><p><strong>It doesn't have the best chip</strong>. The MediaTek Kompanio 838 is enough, but there's little headroom for stuff like playing games at 60 frames without stuttering.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-my-verdict"><span>My Verdict</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JByWPaeinqfw3jo8Ar8bjM" name="lenovo-chromebook-duet-11-review-16.jpg" alt="Cloud storage settings on Lenovo Chromebook Duet 11" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JByWPaeinqfw3jo8Ar8bjM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I wouldn't buy the Lenovo Duet 11 (2024) for myself because I don't need it.

Starting with the phone, Motorola highlights the Razr 2025's "accented and dazzling" use of Swarovski crystals on its "leather-inspired" finish.</p><p>The back of the Razr 2025 features the majority of the crystals in Motorola's new PANTONE Ice Melt color. The company has provided the device with a quilt-like design, where each indentation sports a shiny crystal. Motorola states there are "35 precisely hand-positioned Swarovski crystals, including a larger one with 26 facets on the hinge."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2732px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="jSn2xmmfkbu2akZfEJfcbG" name="Motorola-Razr-2025-Pantone-Ice-Melt-Swarovski-crystals" alt="The Motorola Razr 2025 in Pantone Ice Melt with Swarovski crystals" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jSn2xmmfkbu2akZfEJfcbG.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2732" height="1537" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The remainder of the foldable looks the same as you'd expect, with its full edge-to-edge cover display and dual camera array.

During that launch, the company already revealed the Buds Loop with a Swarovski crystal-inspired design. The crystals lined its stem, bringing a pop or brilliance to the device when worn, as it catches the light. The main difference is that the Swarovski crystals were only available for the Buds Loop PANTONE French Oak variant.</p><p>Now, launching alongside the Razr 2025 is a PANTONE Ice Melt option for the Buds Loop, as well. This cooler color option should pair well with the Swarovski crystals. Motorola reiterated the Buds Loop's open-ear design, which should help reduce user fatigue when worn for extended periods of time. Additionally, this open-ear design helps to keep users engaged with the world around them, so you're not completely unaware when outside.</p><p>This Swarovski collaboration is reportedly "just the beginning" for the Motorola Collection series. The post states this collection involves limited quantities and more devices "coming soon."</p><p>The collection, which features the Motorola Razr 2025 and Buds Loop in PANTONE Ice Melt with Swarovski crystals, will be available on August 7, starting at $999. Consumers can find the devices in the Brilliant Collection at Best Buy, Amazon, and Motorola.com. The company adds that its collection will also hit Cricket Wireless on August 15.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

It would serve as a mighty fine opportunity for AYANEO to get some more publicity and brand recognition before launching a phone. However, I'm on the fence about whether AYANEO will actually be involved in any of the announcements.</p><p>Another potential scenario is that AYANEO could instead lean on the current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>. Doing so would likely mean cheaper processors, which would (hopefully) result in a less-expensive phone.

For example, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/samsung-rolls-out-april-2025-update-for-galaxy-s25-series">April 2025 update</a> included fix <strong>SVE-2025-0255(CVE-2025-20946): Improper handling of exceptional conditions in pairing specific bluetooth devices in Galaxy Watch Bluetooth pairing</strong>.

The FCC has a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/how-protect-yourself-online">list of guidelines</a> on how you can protect yourself when using Bluetooth, including:</p><ul><li>Turning off Bluetooth when it's not in use.</li><li>Unpairing your phone from a rental car's Bluetooth and clearing any data.</li><li>Use Bluetooth in "hidden" mode.</li></ul><p>That last one is pretty easy, as your phone is only "discoverable" when you're present on the Bluetooth menu in your phone's settings. However, you should still be wary of and reject unfamiliar Bluetooth pairing requests. Otherwise, you should enjoy safely pairing your Galaxy S25 to your heart's content.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="2fbe6bab-1ec4-40ee-8b29-48fc8a124384">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/s9GUjxWjwvBNCNBC552HKi.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy S25"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy S25</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Small but mighty</strong></em></p><p>The Galaxy S25 is one of the best compact Android phones money can buy.
