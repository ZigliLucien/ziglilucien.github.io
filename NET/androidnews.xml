Factor in intercity travel and you'll see why I am a reliable authority for dishing out travel advice. I figured out the best accessories and gear that any traveler needs on the go based on my own experiences, via a lot of trial and error.</p><p>A powerful USB adapter is an absolute must-have for several reasons. Firstly, you're never guaranteed to find the right plugs that match your current primary <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-phone-charger">USB-C charger</a>. And secondly, you have limited space when traveling so it's necessary to carry only one charger that works with all your tech.</p><p>This is why I suggest grabbing a travel adapter with multiple combinations of USB ports and a very high wattage so everything from your phone to your laptop can connect to it. If you're seeking the best USB adapter for travel, I've curated this guide based on these criteria.</p><h2 id="make-life-easier-with-these-versatile-travel-adapters-2">Make life easier with these versatile travel adapters</h2>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_hero" data-id="5a98555f-ee3d-4a69-873d-13f668240591">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AYpTCW5FH3AKc7PhNkSQfF.jpg' alt="Epicka TA-105 Max Universal Travel Adapter GaN 75W Fast Charging"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Epicka TA-105 Max Universal Travel Adapter GaN 75W Fast Charging</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Best overall</strong></em></p><p>Epicka delivers unbelievable value for money with this 75W GaN travel adapter.

Pick an option based on the number of devices you travel with. For instance, most folks take their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">smartphone</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">smartwatch</a>, and laptop or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">tablet</a> with them when traveling. Let me break it down for you.</p><p>Depending on the nature of your travel, you may have additional accessories too, like power banks and audio gadgets. Things like power banks and audio accessories don't need a separate charging cable or charger from your phone if it's all USB-C. Most modern laptops support USB-C charging as well, but they need 65W or higher charging speeds.</p><p>If you carry your laptop, tablet, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebook</a> with you, I recommend getting a 65W or higher travel adapter. This enables you to charge all your tech at the maximum possible charging speed on the go without the need to bring along an additional charging brick. On the other hand, if you just carry your phone and some companion accessories, choose a cheaper travel adapter with a lower power rating. For instance, Google Pixel users don't need more than 35W on the go because their phones don't support anything faster anyway. On the other hand, OnePlus users need something a lot speedier.</p><p>In the end, 65W is the safest bet for anyone. Since the price difference isn't significant, you can simply get the Epicka TA-105 Max Universal Travel Adapter as it comes with 75W GaN fast charging. It has plenty of ports and prongs, and the high power rating means you can plug in multiple things in one go and still get the fastest charging speed on everything connected simultaneously. Epicka also provides a two-year warranty on its travel adapter, so you've got a safety net in case something goes wrong.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Overall, it should probably be carrying either a steel or titanium finish.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="nsAVJNo6UnXoQmtkqLgPY6" name="Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-ebay-leak" alt="Galaxy Watch 8 Classic spotted on eBay" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nsAVJNo6UnXoQmtkqLgPY6.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: via eBay listing (amonste_92))</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="gDBxaxAoqZWuKVF6rQBKZ6" name="Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-ebay-leak-04" alt="Galaxy Watch 8 Classic spotted on eBay" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gDBxaxAoqZWuKVF6rQBKZ6.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: via eBay listing (amonste_92))</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="J3588tFgD2KiPBURZMFQY6" name="Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-ebay-leak-01" alt="Galaxy Watch 8 Classic spotted on eBay" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/J3588tFgD2KiPBURZMFQY6.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: via eBay listing (amonste_92))</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="nsMTXkesHFdkj3Y4yhWQY6" name="Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-ebay-leak-05" alt="Galaxy Watch 8 Classic spotted on eBay" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nsMTXkesHFdkj3Y4yhWQY6.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: via eBay listing (amonste_92))</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="KQ9NhL5bvGsvD86dr9rMZ6" name="Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-ebay-leak-02" alt="Galaxy Watch 8 Classic spotted on eBay" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KQ9NhL5bvGsvD86dr9rMZ6.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: via eBay listing (amonste_92))</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The other images also reveal the charger, which is usually accompanied by the retail packaging.

It has everything a user could want from a portable Wi-Fi hotspot: lightning-fast 5G mmWave speeds, 6GHz Wi-Fi support, a 2.5Gbps Ethernet port, and a generous 5,185mAh battery that should last you 13 hours.  It's the complete package, ships unlocked, and supports both <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/verizon-wireless">Verizon</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/att">AT&T</a>.</p><p>There are several significantly cheaper alternatives available if you're not prepared to spend that much cash on a mobile hotspot. The Franklin A50 is a really cheap option that works on AT&T. You can pay as little as $5 per month for this baby. If you want something unlocked, Netgear's more affordable Nighthawk M1 Mobile Hotspot Router (MR1100) is a solid pick that offers a great mix of specs for a low price.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The first kind is ideal for converting wired earbuds and headphones into wireless ones by plugging them into the Bluetooth headphone adapter. This is similar to the function of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-headphone-adapter">USB headphone adapters</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, the second type acts as receivers to which you can connect your wireless Bluetooth headphones or Bluetooth devices like phones and computers to play audio. For example, you could use these on a plane to connect your wireless earbuds to the in-flight entertainment system. Alternatively, you can also use these to add Bluetooth functionality to cars and older sound systems and speakers.</p><p>No need to lose your mind over this if you can't comprehend it. The Anker Soundsync supports dual device connection and comes with both male and female audio ports. It also has a generous 12-hour battery life, volume buttons, a mic, USB-C charging, and all the necessary cables and converters in the box.

It's interesting to see how going that thin might mess with battery life down the road.</p><p>Samsung’s early hints make it clear the next-gen foldables are coming soon. This feels like the first tease in a steady drip of official information, but we’re still waiting on the exact date for the Galaxy Unpacked reveal.</p><ul><li><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables, check out our </em><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

yank my phone out of my pocket and line up the viewfinder. I rarely take photographs during races when I'm focused on staying in the zone, but I ended up taking 22 photos and one finish-line video by the end.</p><p>San Jose is the farthest thing from a scenic course for good photos, but I wanted to test how these glasses performed before bringing them to, say, Big Sur or NYC.</p><p>I also streamed my Half Marathon playlist during the race to keep me motivated, but with my ears fully uncovered to hear anyone trying to pass me and courteously avoid stumbling into them. Since most races "highly discourage" or outright ban headphones, this is a real perk.</p><p>But wearing Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses during the race had its fair share of cons, too.</p><h2 id="my-three-main-issues-with-wearing-smart-glasses-during-a-race-2">My three main issues with wearing smart glasses during a race</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Zbs6FE7iQYqfKbPUdVcGua" name="Ray-Ban-Meta-Smart-Glasses-close-up.jpeg" alt="A close-up of the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Zbs6FE7iQYqfKbPUdVcGua.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I tend not to wear my normal glasses during runs because I can see well enough that it's never felt worth buying a strap to avoid them sliding down my nose. With my 50g Ray-Bans, it's clear I'll need to buy and strap on this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ray-ban.com/usa/accessories/ARB0002STray-ban%20lanyard-/8056597950282">thick, dorky lanyard</a> before I try another race with them.</p><p>They stayed in place for maybe 400m, but once my nose got sweaty, they started slipping. If I pushed them up, I immediately felt the weight bouncing and jiggling on my nose bridge before they slid down again.</p><p>I kept them in place by keeping my head tilted slightly up like some snooty nobleman in a BBC period piece, but it did take me a bit out of the zone to feel so rigid. And even if I wore the lanyard and they stayed in place, I suspect they'd still bounce uncomfortably because of the weight.</p><figure class="van-image-figure pull-right inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:133.33%;"><img id="NjqfQwqkz4bVz4FKeAvb4e" name="Meta-Ray-Ban-glasses-half-marathon-camera-sample-2" alt="A Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses camera sample at the San Jose Half Marathon showing the lead runners of the race in the far distance." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NjqfQwqkz4bVz4FKeAvb4e.jpg" mos="" align="right" fullscreen="1" width="3000" height="4000" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-right expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class="pull-right inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>My second problem is less dire: with no viewfinder, it's easy to forget in the moment that you need to get up close and personal with your Ray-Bans to get a clear photo. I would see something cool and snap a photo, only to later have to squint and zoom in just to remember what my subject was amidst the landscape.</p><p>In this photo, for example, I saw the lead runners finishing their out-and-back the other way and thought it'd be cool to capture them. But they're barely noticeable and blurry because I took the shot from way too far back.</p><p>The resolution is great for glasses, and the ultrawide effect recreates the feeling of standing in a memory rather than composing a photo. In particular, my video of the final sprint, which I can't embed here (sorry), looked startlingly smooth compared to how it felt in the moment.</p><p>The point being, I'm still glad I wore them. I can jog my memory of the course without having to pay $50 for photos of me panting past camerapeople. Next time, I'll know that I need to position myself <strong>right next</strong> to the subject first, or else the photo won't turn out well.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="osCcj5UBZceAcax3mf6NyS" name="ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-with-charging-case" alt="Special edition transparent Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses with their black leather charging case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/osCcj5UBZceAcax3mf6NyS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The real deal-breaker, though, is battery life. I took my Ray-Bans out of the case about 15 minutes before the start and didn't use them until then. At that point, I streamed music and took 22 photos and one video throughout my 1 hour 54-minute race, plus one accidental Meta AI trigger. As I cooled down, I checked my battery life: 8%.</p><p>Meta estimates its glasses will last four hours with "moderate" use and the right conditions, including "100 videos or up to 500 photos per full charge."</p><p>Smart glasses struggle with battery life in cold weather, but I wouldn't call mid-60ºF cold.

It’s the same handy feature that’s been on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> for a while now.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-13s-review">OnePlus 13s</a> launched in India with a new lock screen shortcut that jumps straight into Google Gemini. While the settings label it as "Digital Assistant from Google," <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-13s-gemini-lock-screen-shortcut-3564203/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>’s screenshot gives it away with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>’s unmistakable icon.</p><p>Gemini's lock screen shortcut made waves with the OnePlus 13s launch, but it turns out, it’s not just a 13s thing. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/06/06/oneplus-gemini-lockscreen-shortcut/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, this feature has been around on other OnePlus phones, like the 13, for a while now.</p><h2 id="not-new-just-noticed-2">Not new, just noticed</h2><p>And it’s not even tied to the newest software — the OnePlus 13 it was spotted on was still running a February 1, 2025 security patch, as per the outlet.</p><p>Gemini has pretty much taken over as the go-to AI on Android, and it's everywhere. You can launch it with a long press of the power button or the classic "Hey Google" hotword, among others, making it super easy to tap into what it can do.</p><p>Sure, most modern <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> let you fire up Gemini with a voice command from the lock screen, but that’s just the basics. What makes the dedicated lock screen shortcut special is that it launches the full Gemini app, not just a new query. That means you can jump right back into past chats and pick up where you left off, which voice activation just doesn’t offer.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:396px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:217.17%;"><img id="UTT9SdoiJEeN4qqJRfoq7g" name="OnePlus-13s-Gemini-lockscreen-shortcut" alt="lockscreen shortcut for Gemini on the OnePlus 13s" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UTT9SdoiJEeN4qqJRfoq7g.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="396" height="860" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:396px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:217.17%;"><img id="ednhtXicoENmQUqk3PMk7g" name="OnePlus-13s-Gemini-lockscreen-shortcut" alt="lockscreen shortcut for Gemini on the OnePlus 13s" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ednhtXicoENmQUqk3PMk7g.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="396" height="860" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>It's worth noting that Samsung phones do let you add Gemini as a lockscreen shortcut, but there’s a catch — you usually still have to unlock your phone to actually use it. That means no jumping straight into your chats or full Gemini features without hitting a security screen first. So, the shortcut’s there, but it’s not the seamless, one-tap access you’d hope for.</p><p>The OnePlus 13s is exclusive in India and China, packed with smart features that go toe-to-toe with Samsung’s best. It’s got writing help, real-time call and message translation, and deep Gemini integration baked right into its core apps. But the real flex is a physical AI button and the Gemini lockscreen shortcut.</p><p>Beyond the slick shortcut, the OnePlus 13s is the first to roll out OnePlus’s newest AI features. That includes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-ai-upgrade-for-oneplus-13-and-13s">OnePlus AI Mind</a>, a smart hub that keeps your screenshots, notes, and other bits easy to find later.</p> ]]></dc:content>

In my mind, this would open up a world of possibilities, in addition to being an easy way to access the host of AI features Motorola has packed into its Moto AI suite. However, the implementation leaves a lot to be desired, and frankly, the AI Key is often an afterthought when it easily could have been Motorola’s Action Button.</p><p>Its faults become even more apparent when we live in a world where AI is becoming more prevalent. Motorola’s implementation of it doesn’t really hold a candle to Google or Samsung, but it’s a decent first step. With that said, I think the AI Key is a great idea when done right, and both Google and Samsung would be insane not to consider implementing something like it in future phones.</p><h2 id="moto-ai-limitations-2">Moto AI limitations</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ycdkR38ux8uZtf9BbP6sBW" name="Motorola-Edge-2025-Moto-AI-catch-me-up-01" alt="Moto AI running on a Motorola Edge 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ycdkR38ux8uZtf9BbP6sBW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Motorola is trying to put its own spin on AI, a strategy that includes its own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a> chatbot. You can think of it as a conversational, but somewhat less functional, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> or even Bixby. It can answer questions and respond in a fairly natural way, but it can’t really do much on the phone, which sort of defeats the purpose of having an AI assistant/chatbot. Moto AI is a decent offering, but it still pales in comparison to Google’s AI or Samsung’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>.</p><p>On the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Razr Ultra 2025</a>, you can customize the AI Key to trigger the Moto AI overlay with a long press. Unfortunately, that’s the <em>only </em>option for the long press, which feels like a glaring oversight. You can’t set it to another digital assistant, despite Motorola literally filling the Razr Ultra 2025 with various options.

This differs from how Gemini functions when set to trigger using the power button or corner swipe of the display; it automatically starts listening to you. The fact that I have to press another button to talk to Moto AI adds another seemingly unnecessary step, which feels cumbersome.</p><p>This probably has something to do with Moto AI automatically analyzing what’s on your screen when you trigger it, which allows it to provide suggestions on what you should do. However, I don’t see why it can’t do that, and let me talk to it at the same time.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xEfKGfryXxX5DRtQTPWaCW" name="Motorola-Edge-2025-Moto-AI-02" alt="Moto AI running on a Motorola Edge 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xEfKGfryXxX5DRtQTPWaCW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When I activate Gemini with a YouTube video open, for example, it will know that I’m watching a video and populate options such as “Ask about video” or “Talk Live about video,” but I still have the option to begin speaking to it when triggered automatically.

You could set one gesture, either a single tap or double tap, to open an app of your choice or trigger a Routine, while the other option would be used for Bixby.</p><p>What’s more is that users found ways to sideline Bixby completely by using third-party apps like Tasker, which made it possible to trigger Google Assistant instead. This is something I’ve looked into for the Razr Ultra 2025, but so far, I’ve not had much luck.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1582px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:65.23%;"><img id="wQW8YPQXvYPCKmseDAmuiK" name="bixby-remap-2.jpg" alt="Bixby Remap 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wQW8YPQXvYPCKmseDAmuiK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1582" height="1032" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Still, Samsung had the right idea by giving users options with the button while retaining its primary functionality.

By default, turning off the phone now involves holding down the power button and the volume up button. This is different from how I’ve been conditioned to use the power button for many years, which previously only involved the singular button.</p><p>Fortunately, it’s easy to change to the “normal” way of using the power button on your Pixel or otherwise, but it’s always annoyed me that companies have moved to hijack the power button for purposes other than powering down. After all, there are other gestures I can use to open Gemini, such as swiping from the bottom corner of the display or double-tapping the back of the phone.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2u42Umpxe3p5YtqGi2Y93V" name="Gemini-Live-Plants-3" alt="Using Gemini Live to grow plants and diagnose problems." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2u42Umpxe3p5YtqGi2Y93V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That’s also where having a separate AI button would come in; it would be a perfect way to trigger Gemini on a Pixel.

The Razr Ultra 2025 had a great opportunity with the AI Key, but so far has squandered it with its limited options and somewhat underwhelming Moto AI offering. Google (and by extension, Samsung) should learn from what Motorola and others have done with their buttons, improve upon it, and free the power button from the constraints of AI.</p> ]]></dc:content>

A flop of a thin phone is step one to having a battery that's smaller, safer, and lasts longer.</p><p>Having said all of this — and I really do mean it all, I understand why this phone was built — let's take a look at what we actually got: a phone nobody was asking for and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/i-bought-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-but-no-one-else-did">nobody should buy</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2brMZ5ASdSxTc7usxWHJ5Z" name="Galaxy-S25-Edge-Silver-Thin-Profile-Buttons-11" alt="Right side buttons and thin profile on the Galaxy S25 Edge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2brMZ5ASdSxTc7usxWHJ5Z.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's thin.

But mostly the battery.</p><p>Right now, the batteries are brand new, and you hear people say they almost last all day or will last all day if you manage it correctly. In 90 days, it will be "I can get by topping it off at dinner time," and in 180 days, people will need to charge it even more often. That's how batteries work; the more you use them, the less you <em>can</em> use them.</p><p>As someone who used a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/pixel-phones-pick-new-features-start-june">Pixel 4</a> for a year, let me tell you that it only gets worse from here.

It's one of the most recognizable brands out there, and is worth more than Qualcomm, Sony, Spotify, and even Nintendo. Yet in 2025, it still can't figure out how to build an application that's actually good.</p><p>Earlier this week, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/adobe-photoshop-finally-launches-on-android">Photoshop app for Android</a> was finally released, after it was initially released for iOS <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/a-photoshop-app-for-android-is-coming-and-you-can-try-registering-for-the-beta-now">back in February</a>. In reality, the company has been trying to figure out mobile devices since 2009, before pivoting to apps that only offered specific editing features.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GWzSUiSHX2bjyLWih3XjkC" name="Photoshop-Express-Galaxy-Tab" alt="Photo editing software on an iPad Pro M4 (left) and Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Plus (right)." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GWzSUiSHX2bjyLWih3XjkC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Using Photoshop and Lightroom has become an essential part of my workflow, so needless to say, I was ecstatic to see it arrive on the Play Store. But then I downloaded it on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-3-the-flagship-android-tablet-is-coming-to-the-us-and-canada">OnePlus Pad 3</a>, and immediately wanted to bang my head against the desk.</p><p>When I launched the app, it only appeared in portrait view, which I assumed was only because I needed to sign in first. After signing into my Adobe account, the app remained in portrait mode. Okay, I said to myself, maybe I need to open an image, and then it'll switch over into landscape mode.</p><p>Nope.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="dq65UfNKqowkc5ucoPJjCA" name="photoshop-on-oneplus-pad-3-ipad-pro" alt="Photoshop app on the OnePlus Pad 3 and iPad Pro M4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dq65UfNKqowkc5ucoPJjCA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>No matter what I do, the app is locked to portrait mode, and I just don't get it. Maybe it was something to do with the OnePlus Pad 3, but that's not the case either. After installing the app on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>, it's more of the same.</p><p>This isn't as much of an issue on foldable phones, thanks to the square-ish aspect ratio compared to many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablets</a>. I knew the app was already available on the iPhone and iPad, but hadn't actually used it on either of those devices.</p><p>So after installing it on my iPad Pro, wouldn't ya know — it fired up in landscape orientation. Downloading a picture took forever, but I'll chalk that up to my internet connection, which seems to fluctuate and cut out randomly.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="YV3DxB722agLfUqs5t9VDA" name="play-store-search-photoshop-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra" alt="Google Play Store search results for Photoshop on the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YV3DxB722agLfUqs5t9VDA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Lastly, but certainly not least, I wanted to confirm that the portrait mode lock is not exclusive to the OnePlus Pad 3. I grabbed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review">Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra</a>, opened the Play Store, searched for the app, and couldn't even find it. Then I went to Adobe's Play Store listing page, and of course, the Photoshop app was right there.</p><p>Imagine my surprise when I opened the Photoshop listing to download it, only to be met with a "This app is not compatible" message. How is it that one of the largest and most popular digital media companies releases one of the most highly anticipated apps, only for it to not be "compatible" with arguably the most popular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablet</a> maker?</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="SzuKxZ7uatibLP6HTdHi8A" name="adobe-play-store-apps-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra" alt="Adobe apps landing page in Play Store on the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SzuKxZ7uatibLP6HTdHi8A.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The reason why all of this is so frustrating is that I obviously prefer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-photography-apps-android">editing pictures</a> in landscape mode. I don't have the metrics, but I would assume that this is the case for many, if not the majority. And no, I don't care that the app is still listed as "Beta," because the same app has been on the iPad for almost four months, and it works as I'd expect.</p><p>It all just harkens back to a piece <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/it-still-sucks-that-the-iphone-gets-new-apps-before-android">I wrote in April</a> about Android users being treated as second-class citizens.

But this is Adobe we're talking about, and frankly, there's no excuse.</p><p>It's reached the point that I'm actually leaning towards cancelling my Creative Cloud subscription, something I've had for at least five years. The problem is that I'm familiar with what Adobe's suite of apps is capable of, and I'm not really quite sure if anything out there can really match that.</p><p>But, it sure seems like it's time for me to find out.</p> ]]></dc:content>

That new direction is finally showing up across the board, including right inside Android Settings, thanks to the latest Google Play services update.</p><p>You’ll now see Find Hub in place of Find My Device when you head to Security & privacy in your Android settings and tap on Device finders. From there, you can jump straight into the Find Hub app or open the web version with a tap.</p><p>The old "Use Find My Device" switch within Security & privacy has been swapped out for a clearer "Allow device to be located" option. It’s a small wording change, but it highlights the shift—this isn’t just about tracking one device anymore.</p><h2 id="rolling-out-now-2">Rolling out now</h2><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/06/05/find-hub-android-settings/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, the full Find Hub rebrand is rolling out now through Google Play services version 25.20.37. This update means that every mention of "Find My Device" in Android Settings is now stamped with the new Find Hub label.</p><p>Google’s not stopping at just the Settings app. The Find Hub rebrand has also made its way into the Google services menu. You’ll now spot it under the Recommended tab.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:379px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.27%;"><img id="3PjfBLnp2G56g7YSFDB5nb" name="Google-Find-Hub" alt="Find Hub rebrand across Android settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3PjfBLnp2G56g7YSFDB5nb.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="379" height="850" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:379px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.27%;"><img id="bkbGzGB8BUK62eGpjf75nb" name="Google-Find-Hub" alt="Find Hub rebrand across Android settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bkbGzGB8BUK62eGpjf75nb.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="379" height="850" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Last month, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/googles-popular-find-my-device-gets-a-revamp-and-notable-enhancements">kicked off a major shake-up of its Find My Device tool</a> on Android. The move came alongside a big new feature: the ability to find people, not just your devices. Right on cue, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-find-hub-app-redesign-rolling-out">the app got a fresh update too</a>—now called Find Hub—with new Device and People tabs to make that rebrand crystal clear.</p><p>Google is betting big on UWB (Ultra-wideband) to make Find Hub actually useful when you need it most. While Bluetooth just gives you a general sense of where something is, UWB lets you zero in with turn-by-turn directions. It's about time Android caught up to what Apple has been doing with AirTags since 2021 (and Samsung copied soon after).</p><p>But UWB is just the start. Google is also gearing up to add satellite connectivity. That means even when you’re way off the grid with no cell signal, you can still stay connected with friends and family.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Deadpool has evidently been years in the making.</p><p>The game felt like an immediate and obvious foil to 2024's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/batman-arkham-shadow-review">Batman: Arkham Shadow VR</a>, made by another Meta-acquired developer, Camouflaj. Both have professional voice actors, long story-driven campaigns, and demanding next-gen graphics. And yet they couldn't be more different in combat, movement, and tone.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="hjHzpAoQXNBfcakQUMcgHH" name="Marvels-Deadpool-VR-screenshot-slash-effect" alt="A Deadpool VR screenshot showing a bloody sword attack and comic-book script "SLASHIMI!" above a dying bad guy." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hjHzpAoQXNBfcakQUMcgHH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Twisted Pixel / Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Deadpool snarks his way around a SHIELD helicarrier, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mojoworld">Mojoworld</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Spirit_of_Xandar">Spirit of Xandar</a>, and other Marvel Comics multiverse locales that feel like polar opposites to the dark, grounded Gotham. And the violent gun and sword battles felt more chaotic and less structured than Batman's mix of timed punches and gadget combos.</p><p>It also sounds <em>very</em> different from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_(video_game)">Activision's Deadpool</a> from 2013, which heavily focused on the X-Men comics and characters like Wolverine and Rogue. Deadpool VR's cast stars more niche characters like Mojo, Lady Deathstrike, and Flag-Smasher, and the narrative doesn't seem quite as dependent on 4th-wall breaks as the old game.</p><p>Having spent nearly an hour bumbling through one of the early levels, I can share my thoughts on the best and worst parts of Marvel's Deadpool VR during my hands-on, as well as all the game info that Twisted Pixel shared with us during the Q&A afterwards.</p><h2 id="gory-creative-combat-and-silly-one-liners-2">Gory, creative combat and silly one-liners</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4Jof1MtYccs" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>My demo started fairly early on in Marvel's Deadpool VR storyline, with Deadpool's head being studied by an evil scientist on a stolen helicarrier before you control his headless body to kill the scientist and free yourself.</p><p>Then you run through the ship, guided by a hapless SHIELD rookie by comms as you learn the controls and combat. By default, you can grab a sword over your shoulder, gun from your hip, or grenade from your wrist, and more weapons will be introduced as the game continues like a bow and arrow.</p><p>When you take damage, parts of Deadpool will fall off, and you'll have to adjust your gameplay strategy accordingly (until they grow back).</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="AAM7zMAMQcvn2bZatsTG6H" name="Marvels-Deadpool-VR-screenshot-cutscene" alt="A screenshot of Deadpool's headless body about to slam a bloodied scientist's head against a desk, with cartoonish text "Was that a tooth?!" next to him." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AAM7zMAMQcvn2bZatsTG6H.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Twisted Pixel / Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I had the least trouble mastering gunplay, aiming your default pistol or picking up weapons along the way and blasting waves of foes. You can aim at specific body parts to blast them off or use a grapple weapon to fling or disarm foes.</p><p>But gun combat is fairly common in a lot of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">Meta Quest games</a>, and the developers want you to get more creative. For that, the focal point is the close-quarters combat. With the sword, you can dismember body parts, then pick them up and throw them at other enemies. You can counter attacks from shielded foes, or fling your sword at a far-away enemy before grabbing a new one.</p><p>The goal, Twisted Pixel said, is to "Say yes to the player" and "reward creativity," and that there was a "bunch of stuff that you guys didn't try" that we'd discover naturally across the campaign, but is available from the start.</p><p>The devs also promised things like a "boomerang sword" and "exploding bullets," and there will be custom moves you can use against specific enemies or with certain weapons.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="24v6m78PT2Yw9gRYmkGKyG" name="Marvels-Deadpool-VR-screenshot-violent-sword-combat" alt="A Deadpool VR screenshot showing an impaled head on a held sword with the headless soldier in the near distance." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/24v6m78PT2Yw9gRYmkGKyG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Twisted Pixel / Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, sword combat is also where I had the most trouble. I would swipe my sword at a foe and, for whatever reason, it would simply dance around their body with no effect while they hit or shot me. I especially struggled with shielded foes meant for close-quarters combat, who would wail on me while I swiped helplessly back.</p><p>I assumed it was a skill issue on my end, and I needed to master the timing of sword strikes better. But other journalists I spoke to after the demo agreed that sword attacks felt somewhat weightless.</p><p>The Twisted Pixel devs responded by saying they didn't want the reverse side of VR melee combat, where you simply hold your sword toward an enemy, "waggle it," and have it "chop people up instantly." They say they're "still working on" a "combination of animation, haptic feedback, and sound" to make sword impacts feel satisfying.</p><p>So I'm curious how it'll feel in the final version, with more practice. I'd say swordplay is the most important part of a Deadpool VR game, so I'm hoping they get it right.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="mAKH2oeLeJ6drmf5mRaPWH" name="Marvels-Deadpool-VR-screenshot-sword-combat" alt="A Deadpool VR screenshot showing Deadpool holding a sword and throwing knife as two ninja-like foes charge towards the player." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mAKH2oeLeJ6drmf5mRaPWH.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Twisted Pixel / Meta)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="yaZqsMWvJDow3EtTVRrtRH" name="Marvels-Deadpool-VR-screenshot-bow-and-arrow-combat" alt="A Deadpool VR screenshot showing the player holding a bow and arrow, pointing at a charging ninja enemy." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yaZqsMWvJDow3EtTVRrtRH.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Twisted Pixel / Meta)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="PN63uPW5fkRMo5rohWpCNH" name="Marvels-Deadpool-VR-screenshot-gun-combat" alt="A Deadpool VR screenshot showing Deadpool dual-wielding pistols pointed at a cyborg enemy leaping down towards the player." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PN63uPW5fkRMo5rohWpCNH.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Twisted Pixel / Meta)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="2Ai9zRfMFdprhZd7mii6GH" name="Marvels-Deadpool-VR-screenshot-sniper-combat" alt="A Deadpool VR screenshot showing the player pointing a laser-pointed sniper rifle at a foe across the room." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2Ai9zRfMFdprhZd7mii6GH.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Twisted Pixel / Meta)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Outside of combat, Deadpool runs and parkours around the stage, with double-jumping available for more flexible movement. Just in the early level, I spotted comic book collectables and mysterious doors I couldn't open labeled "Lady Deadpool" and other Deadpool-adjacent names.</p><p>Twisted Pixel promised replayability features and secret levels, so I wonder if you'll be able to go back through levels as other multiverse versions of Deadpool, similar to what we saw in the movie Deadpool & Wolverine.</p><p>But the <em>main</em> version of Deadpool, voiced by Neil Patrick Harris, was a lot of fun in my brief hands-on. They said their version of Deadpool "pulls more strongly from the comics" than from the movie Deadpool. They also mentioned how great it was to collaborate with Harris, who would riff off their script with his own comedy and one-liners.</p><h2 id="diving-into-the-marvel-mojoverse-2">Diving into the Marvel Mojoverse</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ZQbjLTNUaUE44Bumq4kdTH" name="Marvels-Deadpool-VR-screenshot-mojoworld" alt="A Deadpool VR screenshot showing the character Mojo and two bodyguards standing in a casino-like room, with Mojo flipping an M-labeled gold coin to Deadpool." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZQbjLTNUaUE44Bumq4kdTH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Twisted Pixel / Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The main premise of Deadpool VR seems to be that Deadpool makes some kind of "shitty deal" with the sorcerer Mojo, aka "hip-hop Satan," without reading the "fine print."</p><p>He then gets flung into different Marvel Comics locations in the Mojoverse, an extradimensional and extratemporal realm, facing off against foes like Flag-Smasher, Lady Deathstrike, and Omega Red.</p><p>Twisted Pixel promised "iconic (and not-so-iconic) villains," so I'm curious if we'll get more household names or stick to smaller foes to make Deadpool VR more distinct.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Vk6irNUjymbKrVB4aTBWFH" name="Marvels-Deadpool-VR-screenshot-combat-holding-arm" alt="A Deadpool VR screenshot showing Deadpool holding his severed left hand in his right arm, with foes shooting the player and red damage indicators along the screen edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Vk6irNUjymbKrVB4aTBWFH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Twisted Pixel / Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>"We're not pulling from a particular story arc that exists already," the devs explained. "This is definitely our own thing. We wanted to come to this and make sure that it's our own story, it's our own Deadpool."</p><p>And by doing it this way, they want it to be <em>your</em> Deadpool that you can play in unique ways. "If people can get Deadpool in their head, they'll try stuff that Deadpool would, and it's super fun because it rewards you for doing it." So any time a playtester tries something that doesn't work, they add it in the next build.</p><p>Marvel's Deadpool VR comes out in "late 2025." My guess is that we'll see a proper release date around Meta Connect 2025 this fall, with more details on things like pricing and campaign length.</p><p>You'll need a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Quest 3</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-review">Quest 3S</a> to play this exclusive, which may disappoint Deadpool-loving gamers without a VR headset.

If you know what specs you're looking for and in what sort of price range, one look at this chart will tell you which cable is right for you.</p><p>If you're still clueless, don't worry my friend. I've got you! Ask yourself a few questions and the answer will become clear.</p><p>First off, what phone do you use? If you're an Apple user with an iPhone older than the 15 series, obviously you'll need a lightning connector. Anker and Raycon are both great options. The Raycon cable is superior from every perspective, except for the cost. It's got swappable connectors so you can use it with all your other gadgets too. If you don't want to spend $35 on a cable, Anker will do just fine.</p><p>For my Android users, pick the Baseus 100W cable and don't look back. The 6ft variant is long enough for most use cases and the nylon-braided structure makes it highly durable. And get this, the 6ft version is only $10! That's the best deal you'll ever find on such a speedy USB-C cable.</p><p>Now, if you've got a wired pair of headphones, earphones, or in-ear monitors, you'll probably want to check out the budget-friendly JSAUX USB-C Headphone Charger too. This DAC adds a handy 3.5mm headphone jack to your smartphone, something all the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> lack these days. Since there's USB-C passthrough charging, you don't even have to worry about blocking off your Type-C port when using the adapter. For $13, that's as good as it gets.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Will it get cheaper, and is it worth it to buy the 2024 device when the next-gen flip phone drops? </p><p>After all, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 debuted last summer with a steep $1,099.99 price tag, so it&apos;s no wonder people have been looking for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/deals">deals</a>. At this point we can only speculate, but I&apos;ve been working launches like this long enough that I have a pretty good idea of what you can expect. Let&apos;s dive in. </p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-we-know"><span>What we know</span></h3><p>If the latest leaks and rumors are correct, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> will be revealed during a live Samsung Unpacked event in early July. The new clamshell foldable will likely be announced alongside the premium Galaxy Z Fold 7 and two Samsung smartwatches, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8 and Watch 8 Classic</a>. </p><p>The Z Flip 7 is expected to come loaded with a powerful Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, an updated design, and a larger cover display than ever before (think more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025">Motorola Razr</a>-esque). The flip phone is also certain to feature all of the latest Galaxy AI software features and seven years of guaranteed OS and security upgrades. As for the cameras, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/early-alleged-galaxy-z-flip-7-camera-specs-detailed">one rumor</a> has suggested that the Z Flip 7 will retain its predecessor&apos;s camera tech, which would be quite controversial among Samsung users if the leak proves accurate. </p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="muLAZxgnWdWVKXRtcCm2bH" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-Flex-Mode-Panel.jpg" alt="Galaxy Z Flip 6 Flex Mode Panel with Instagram running" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/muLAZxgnWdWVKXRtcCm2bH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Still, the biggest question mark comes down to the phone&apos;s price. After several generations without a price increase, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 was revealed last year with a starting price of $1,099.99, which was $100 more than its predecessor.</p><p>Will Samsung increase the price of its clamshell phone again in 2025? It&apos;s hard to say, but considering that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Motorola Razr Ultra (2025)</a> — the Flip&apos;s biggest competitor — was recently unveiled with a $1,300 price tag, I wouldn&apos;t put it past them. There&apos;s also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-might-hold-back-the-budget-galaxy-z-flip-7-model-until-late-2025">some speculation</a> that the Z Flip 7 will be announced alongside a more-affordable "Fan Edition" version of the phone, but details on that rumor are scarce.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-will-the-z-flip-6-get-cheaper"><span>Will the Z Flip 6 get cheaper?</span></h3><p>So now for the big question: will last year&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> finally get cheaper now that the Z Flip 7 is on the way? The answer may not be as simple as you&apos;d like. </p><p>The good news is that the top-rated flip phone is already being discounted fairly often by retailers and wireless carriers alike. As of writing, for example, the unlocked Z Flip 6 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D195JKYD"><strong>over $200 off at Amazon,</strong></a> while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.att.com/buy/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip6.html"><strong>AT&T is dropping up to $1,000 off</strong></a> the phone when you trade in and add a line. </p><p>Now, you might see those deals and be tempted to wait until the Z Flip 7 arrives to see if the price drops even further, but I&apos;d be careful. Retailers will often discount a phone <em>before</em> its next generation arrives to make room for new stock. This means that the Galaxy Z Flip 6 might be sold out on most sites by the time you&apos;re ready to buy, which gives you less leverage as a consumer.</p><p>But there&apos;s a bright side. Amazon&apos;s Prime Day sale is likely to be announced in the coming weeks, and if past year&apos;s are any indication, the event will fall right around the same time as the Galaxy Z Flip 7 announcement. <strong>This upcoming sale might be the best opportunity to get the Galaxy Z Flip 6 at a serious discount</strong>, as retailers all across the web will be taking on Amazon with competitive offers of their own. This puts you in the driver&apos;s seat, and it will likely result in some of the best Galaxy Z Flip 6 deals we&apos;ve ever seen. </p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="8a540a43-dcb6-468b-b250-8c0176ee90d9">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JrEgbbZSCjj6z4VY5Zx5XP.jpg' alt="Render of the blue Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Still a great flip phone</strong></em></p><p>Although it's about to hit last-gen status, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 remains a great <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phone</a> with a sleek, super-pocketable design, loads of AI features, and years of guaranteed software support.

This year, Spotify said it paid out over $10 billion to the music industry globally in 2024, marking the largest single-year payout by any retailer in music history.</p><p>The report also adds that nearly 1,500 artists generated over $1 million in royalties from Spotify alone in 2024. And 80% of these artists didn't have their song reach the Spotify Global Daily Top 50 chart. Meaning, without having a mainstream hit, they were still able to generate revenue.</p><p>The surprising part, however, is that Canadian artists seem to be thriving globally, and in 2024, Canadian music artists earned CAD<strong> </strong>$460 million in royalties on Spotify, which is almost double the earnings they made since 2019. Spotify says this was possible because Canadian-grown global stars like The Weeknd, Justin Bieber, Céline Dion, and more have built a strong foundation for budding artists.</p><p>"That’s not just streams; that’s sustainable careers being built in studios, basements, and tour vans from Vancouver to Halifax," the streaming giant added.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3imaMspAbZLSG2pt5DtEZT" name="The-Weeknd-on-Spotify" alt="The Weeknd on Spotify" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3imaMspAbZLSG2pt5DtEZT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Spotify)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Speaking of where these royalties were earned, Spotify says that 94% of the money earned by Canadian artists through Spotify came from outside Canada.</p><p>This means Canada has become one of the world's top music exporters, and that Canadian music is not only being streamed locally but also in "cities like Jakarta, Osaka, Melbourne, London, São Paulo, Berlin, Mexico City, and Seoul."</p><p>Since Canada is a bilingual country, its French music also saw a 15% growth in global Spotify royalties just in the past year.</p><p>For instance, "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://open.spotify.com/track/44A0o4jA8F2ZF03Zacwlwx">Québécois artist Patrick Watson’s 'Je te laisserai des mots'</a> was the most popular francophone track on Spotify globally in 2024, and the first French-language track to pass 1 billion streams," the report stated.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4083px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="xiSaKKC5vQVxF8rM7NZufU" name="Spotify-Jam" alt="Spotify Jam" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xiSaKKC5vQVxF8rM7NZufU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4083" height="2297" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Furthermore, Spotify says that Canadian women have also been at the front and center of music creation, and since 2020, their global streams on Spotify have also doubled. And as of 2024, "40% of Canadian artists earning over CAD $1 million on Spotify were women or in groups with both male and female members."</p><p>“This is what Canada sounds like—diverse, digital, and not just thriving domestically, but leading on the world stage. The data is clear in underscoring the vital role that export plays in sustaining the overall health of Canada’s music industry,” said Xenia Manning, director of Global Music Policy, Spotify.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The tipster alleges that Huawei is working on a sequel to its Mate XT tri-fold, which could be called the "Mate XT 2," if we're being incremental. There's supposedly more going on with this next phone by way of hardware upgrades.</p><p>DCS claims the tri-fold could sport a brand new, upgraded SoC (processor), possibly built off an "N-1" generation chip. In response to a comment, DCS said the chip could be Huawei's Kirin 9020. Additionally, the phone's imaging power could go up a level, though it's unclear just how far Huawei is willing to push its cameras.</p><p>Considering how early these rumors are, there's nothing concrete to go on (aside from the chip's apparent name drop). More than that, the tipster alleges Huawei's "Mate XT 2" could launch sooner than we think.</p><p>The phone could be eyeing a "second half of the year" timeframe, which kind of sounds like what the Chinese OEM did in 2024.</p><h2 id="the-tri-fold-surprise-that-is-the-mate-xt-2">The Tri-Fold Surprise that is the Mate XT</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2342px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="LRU4rJP9uDdMqnnXCJm4tj" name="huawei-mate-xt-promo-3.jpg" alt="Huawei Mate XT promo image" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LRU4rJP9uDdMqnnXCJm4tj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2342" height="1317" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Huawei)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Huawei <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-rollable-phone-pursuit-alleged-report">came out of nowhere</a> with its tri-fold, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-ultimate-design-launch">the Mate XT</a>, in September last year. Without talking about its eye-watering price tag (¥19,999/~$2,808), the device features a 10.2-inch display when fully unfolded. The phone quickly turns from something handheld to a phone-tablet. The publication reiterates the device's use of the Kirin 9010 processor, so it would make sense that Huawei might upgrade that key specification.</p><p>Additionally, the Mate XT debuted with a triple camera array, consisting of a 50MP lens with f/1.4 aperture, a 12MP ultrawide-angle lens, and a 12MP periscope lens.</p><p>With rumors suggesting we could see an imaging upgrade, maybe Huawei's looking at the ultrawide and periscope lenses. Of course, it would be nice if that primary lens jumped to 100MP or more, but we'll just have to wait and see.</p><p>Aside from Huawei, we're also expecting Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-teases-a-wild-new-foldable-phone-dropping-in-late-2025">to step into the tri-fold world</a> for the first time.

In a subsequent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/scheduled-actions-gemini-app/">blog post</a>, Google states users will be able to ask Gemini to perform "a task at a specific time, or transform a prompt you're already using into a recurring action."</p><p>It seems Gemini will be able to cover a wide range of potential actions from users. For example, users can have a summary based on their emails in the morning from Gemini. Additionally, Gemini can collect and display sports scores for you, detail important calendar event roundups, and more.</p><p>What's more, Google says Gemini will work fine with "one-off" actions, too.</p><p>Your scheduled actions in Gemini will be housed on a new page in the app's settings. From there, users can change scheduled times or perhaps the action itself, as well as delete it entirely if needed. As previously stated, scheduled actions in the Gemini are rolling out today for mobile users.</p><p>Google adds functionality extends to "qualifying" Workspace business and education plans in this rollout, too.</p><h2 id="gemini-continues-forward-2">Gemini continues forward</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3394px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="QUuejB6p5fokJUFyse3swb" name="Google-Gemini-app-home-page.JPG" alt="The Google Gemini app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QUuejB6p5fokJUFyse3swb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3394" height="1910" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google isn't slowing down after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-i-o-2025-the-biggest-announcements-from-ai-to-android-xr">I/O 2025</a>, as Gemini's upgrades sit well beyond its newest scheduled actions update.

This theory is also consistent with past years of the event, as the Galaxy Z Fold 6 was initially announced on July 10th, 2024 with a July 24th release date. </p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 is expected to be announced alongside the clamshell-style <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a>, plus we should be getting a release date for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8</a> and Watch 8 Classic. There's also a chance that Samsung will surprise-drop a first look at its triple-folding <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-tri-fold-name-change-hardware-specs-rumored">Galaxy G Fold</a>, but info on that phone is relatively scarce at this time. </p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="f7mGPGbcitjef6WE8oaYJj" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-12.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 review cover screen in-hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f7mGPGbcitjef6WE8oaYJj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For specs, the premium foldable is likely to feature the same Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset that powers the Galaxy S25 series, plus a new-and-improved "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-may-finally-bring-this-much-needed-upgrade-to-the-galaxy-z-fold-7">creaseless foldable panel</a>", two vibrant AMOLED displays, and the thinnest design of any Z Fold phone to date.</p><p>It's also quite possible that the Z Fold 7 will be more expensive than its predecessor, and considering that the 2024 model already started at a steep $1,799.99, we better hope that the preorder deals are especially good this year.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-will-the-z-fold-6-get-cheaper"><span>Will the Z Fold 6 get cheaper?</span></h3><p>So given the information detailed above, should you expect the Galaxy Z Fold 6 to get cheaper when the Z Fold 7 arrives? Well, it's complicated. </p><p>For starters, it's worth mentioning that the Galaxy Z Fold 6 is already being discounted quite heavily across most retailers. At the time of writing, for instance, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Handsfree-Interpreter-Manufacturer/dp/B0D18QJCPR"><strong>Amazon is slashing over 20% off</strong></a> the unlocked foldable, bringing the price down to $1,499.99. These deals are presumably meant to clear stock ahead of the Z Fold 7's release, and with the swift arrival of Amazon Prime Day (also slated for early July), it's unlikely that there will be many Z Fold 6 units <em>left</em> when the new foldable phone finally arrives. </p><p>In other words, I'd suggest that the best time to buy a phone is <em>right before</em> its next generation arrives, rather than right after. Sure, the Z Fold 6 might get a permanent price drop when its successor hits store shelves, but it's just as likely to be largely out of stock by that time (unless you're cool with a refurbished version). <strong>In conclusion, if you prefer unlocked </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/deals"><strong>phone deals</strong></a><strong>, Amazon Prime Day 2025 is going to be the best time to buy the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6. </strong></p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="cf31ab8c-d35f-433a-931f-77066ba9372b">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:98.61%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Qk9BrbQMCLYk6ofsRaMfP.jpg' alt="Galaxy Z Fold 6 render in white"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Premium foldable, premium price</strong></em></p><p>Although it's soon to be supplanted by the Z Fold 7, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 remains one of the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">best foldable phones</a> around, boasting a powerful Snapdragon chipset, two glorious 120Hz AMOLED displays, and excellent battery life.

According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/06/05/google-search-live-testing/">9to5Google</a>, which spotted the test, this experiment places AI Mode in the center with a familiar Gemini Live vibe. When activated in the main Google app, via a wavelength icon under the search bar, Search Live will welcome users with a descriptive splash page. The company states, "With Live, you can have a real-time voice conversation with AI Mode to find exactly what you're looking for."</p><p>After unmuting, users will be free to voice whatever their query is, similar to speaking in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/gemini-live-pixel-9-pro-grocery-list">Gemini Live</a> (even the UI is kind of the same).</p><p>Search Live will process your query and is said to deliver a "scrollable carousel" of results. This is likely similar to every other Google Search experience where, when receiving your answers, the most prominent (or best) result is first, with varying degrees of relevance beneath that. Users can, of course, interact with these results, tapping them for more information.</p><p>The publication states users can ask follow-up questions if they're still unsure; however, there's a chance <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-tests-experimental-ai-mode">AI Mode</a> will ask you to "clarify."</p><h2 id="google-s-highlight-ai-mode-2">Google's Highlight: AI Mode</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:267px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.72%;"><img id="B5tjnLpQPBAH93yu9HGWmQ" name="google-ai-mode-search-live-splash-page" alt="AI Mode's "Search Live" test displays a splash page explaining users can have a conversation with the feature for real-time results." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B5tjnLpQPBAH93yu9HGWmQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="267" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:276px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:217.39%;"><img id="NVogVeKWQfCuyUKExMv3mQ" name="google-ai-mode-search-live-results-example" alt="AI Mode's "Search Live" test will display a "scrollable carousel" of results for users to look through." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NVogVeKWQfCuyUKExMv3mQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="276" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>There are some little details, such as the "Transcript" button's existence isn't what it seems. The post states tapping this just lets you text chat with AI Mode, not receive written notes for reflection later. Moreover, this update is seemingly rolling out for Search Labs users in the Google app on Android and iOS. Users are also able to continue their conversations with Search Live even when the app is in the background.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-i-o-2025-the-biggest-announcements-from-ai-to-android-xr">I/O 2025</a> was jam-packed with information regarding AI Mode, Gemini, M3 Expressive for Android, and more. We're here to talk about AI Mode, and that new feature stood out, as Google announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/ai-mode-levels-up-with-new-ai-features-stealing-google-searchs-spotlight">integration with Project Astra</a>. In short, this upgrade will soon bring conversational capabilities to AI Mode when using your phone's camera. The feature will be able to see what you see, taking in everything it needs to before delivering your results.</p><p>Additionally, AI Mode is set to gain <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://deepmind.google/technologies/project-mariner/">Project Mariner's capabilities</a>, too. What this will do is let the feature "understand" all elements of a website. This will take away some manual tasks from the user, like filling your online cart with items to purchase. Instead, you can ask AI Mode to scour the web, find some gameday tickets for you, and it'll do just that.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Additionally, Samsung will offer buyers up to <strong>$500 in instant trade-in credit on the phone</strong>, along with three free months of Samsung Care Plus, and access to early upgrades through the New Galaxy Club program.</p><p>It's worth noting that the Samsung Galaxy S25 is our pick for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones#section-best-small-phone">best small Android phone</a> on the market. With a really vivid, 6.2-inch AMOLED display and excellent photo and video capabilities, the S25 has a lot to offer to the modern smartphone user. Samsung also guarantees seven Android OS updates, making it more future-proof than some competitors. Similar deals are also available for the S25 Ultra and S25 Edge for a limited time, if you're interested in upgrading from the base model.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="f05f3bdd-02da-4691-b8e3-db34ae703de3" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy S25 (256GB): $859.99" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy S25 (256GB): $859.99" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-s25/buy/galaxy-s25-256gb-unlocked-sm-s931udbexaa/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:554px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="p7pcw6vmJ48V2Sjh6xgGrL" name="Samsung Galaxy S25 in Pinkgold official render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p7pcw6vmJ48V2Sjh6xgGrL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="554" height="554" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy S25 (256GB): </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-s25/buy/galaxy-s25-256gb-unlocked-sm-s931udbexaa/" target="_blank" data-dimension112="f05f3bdd-02da-4691-b8e3-db34ae703de3" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy S25 (256GB): $859.99" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy S25 (256GB): $859.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$859.99</del> <strong>From $299.99 with trade-in during the Discover Samsung event</strong></a></p><p>The 2025 Discover Samsung Sale comes with a ton of nice deals, including free storage boosts for the Galaxy S25, S25 Ultra, and S25 Edge.

In almost every case, the answer isn't what people want to hear, and it looks like that will be the case with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>, which is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-is-getting-qi2-1">rumored not to include built-in MagSafe charging</a>.</p><p>I've said it before, and I'll say it again: stop expecting it. Not that those magnetic Qi2 chargers aren't handy; I certainly see the appeal to people who can't or won't set their phone down long enough to charge, and millions of dollars have been spent to let you know that you should want it. When a phone launches and you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-buying-time-with-galaxy-s25-qi2-implementation">need to buy a case</a> to use the magnetic accessories, you're disappointed.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:960px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:60.10%;"><img id="gUnm8fpf7MSkase53rkqEh" name="Samsung-galaxy-z-fold-ultra" alt="Samsung teases a Z Fold Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gUnm8fpf7MSkase53rkqEh.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="960" height="577" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Nothing anyone can say is going to change that. But you can find some solace in knowing that you have a new phone that supports <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20231115984149/en/Qi-v2.0-Standard-for-Wireless-Charging-Is-Now-Ready-to-Provide-Enhanced-User-Experience" target="_blank">the technical specifications</a> that are newer, safer, and better, even if you had to buy an ugly case to get the magnetic parts. And you should be thankful the "right" players <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-will-come-to-more-android-phones-in-2025-with-help-from-samsung-and-google">pushed for the latest Qi charging specs to be split off this way</a>, because engineers who design phones surely hate magnets.</p><p>That's half said in jest, but it's partially true: unless you specifically designed a phone with magnets in a particular place, they are going to interfere with the way it's supposed to work. Magnets can mess up electronics, especially a device as complicated as a phone.</p><h2 id="but-apple-can-do-it-2">"But Apple can do it!"</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="psYSd2jGSX3bC8R3dvGC9L" name="Moonside-MagLight-lifestyle-5.jpg" alt="Moonside MagLight and companion accessories" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/psYSd2jGSX3bC8R3dvGC9L.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Yup. And Apple "invented" the idea of using a trio of magnets to hold a wireless charger in the right spot. Then it built a phone around it. It was such a novel idea that Apple wanted to share it and gave it away, becoming part of the Qi2 standards. Thanks, Apple.</p><p>But Samsung is not Apple. Samsung has been working on phone design years ahead of the actual release date, and doesn't want to go back to the drawing board, so it can be more like an iPhone. We probably shouldn't want them to do it, but that means we have to buy a case, and we grumble about it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yEhpLmBzkxgQH49kzCAoNW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-review-08" alt="Galaxy S25 Plus in hand with a case on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yEhpLmBzkxgQH49kzCAoNW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I think the current system works perfectly. If you want to attach your charger, Pop Socket, or whatever else you want with magnets, you can. In the meantime, Samsung doesn't have to scrap a lot of work, and we may get the next big thing we never knew we wanted or needed from them.</p><p>Perhaps it should include a Qi2 Ready case inside the box with the phone instead of charging money for it, though. Just a thought, Samsung.</p><p>One day, we will see a new Samsung Galaxy with magnets built in, just like we'll see a Pixel with them, unless some better way to charge comes along. Maybe even next year. Until then, know that companies aren't doing it to piss you off; they are doing it because it's the best way right now.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p> ]]></dc:content>

Even just the Multi-Screen Connect functionality, which should at least allow me to transfer files back and forth, just wouldn't work.</p><p>I tried a completely different Windows computer, and still came up empty.

Samsung's Galaxy Tab S10 lineup is comprised of just two models, and despite dropping Qualcomm, both are still more expensive than the Pad 3.

Now that you do, you can take full advantage of it. But there are a few things to note as well.</p><p><strong>You won't lose your playlist</strong></p><p>You don’t need to worry that transferring a playlist from one service to YouTube Music will remove it from that host service. The playlist will still exist there. (Though you will lose access everywhere it exists if you no longer subscribe to a paid service).</p><p><strong>Changes don't sync</strong></p><p>Note that if you make changes to the version of the playlist in YouTube Music, these modifications won’t sync with the other one. So, if you add or remove a song or two, for example, you’ll have to go back to Spotify, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/apple-music-youtube-music-playlist-transfer">Apple Music</a>, or your other service as well to mirror that change manually. If you want to get around that, always update the playlist in the main service then transfer it over again whenever you’ve made big changes so the two playlists are in sync.</p><p><strong>Easily transfer an entire Apple Music library</strong></p><p>A useful tip: if transferring from Apple Music, you can use the handy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/c69125f5226e448dabf4f816c3264388">Add Entire playlist to library shortcut</a> first to instantly create a playlist with all your songs. From there, you can then transfer your entire library to YouTube Music in one fell swoop as a new, massive “playlist”.</p><p><strong>Some songs might not match</strong></p><p>If there are songs that aren’t available on YouTube Music within the playlists you try to transfer, you won’t be able to transfer them. You should receive a notification, however, advising that the song could not be matched. Playlists with podcasts are not supported and cannot be imported to, or exported from, YouTube Music.</p><p><strong>The process can take long for larger playlists</strong></p><p>Since the process can anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours depending on how many playlists you want to transfer and how many songs, plan to do this when you’re at home and can keep your device plugged in and fully charged.</p><h2 id="transfer-away-2">Transfer away!</h2><p>The feature is one of the reasons YouTube Music is among <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">the best streaming music apps</a>. It’s a great way to keep all your favorite playlists from different services in one place, accessing them when and how you want.

This update fixes that with smooth left-right swiping.</li><li>You’ll also get a quick-access bar to react or comment without breaking your flow.</li></ul><hr><p>Google appears to be cooking up a Messages update in beta that makes it way easier to reply to photos and videos, and it could be perfect for those meme-packed, media-heavy chats.</p><p>Spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-messages-media-replies-swiping-3564243/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> in the latest Messages beta, Google is apparently testing a swipe feature that lets you zip through all shared pictures and videos in a chat. It’s a simple move that could seriously level up scrolling through media in busy group chats.</p><p>At present, you can react or reply to photos and videos in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-first-things-to-do">Google Messages</a>, but every time you do that with another media, it kicks you back to the main chat. This feels a bit annoying when you're trying to go through a bunch of media at once.</p><p>This new way of viewing media is about to address this shortcoming. Instead of leaving one photo and hunting through the chat for the next, you’ll just swipe left or right to flip through recent or older pictures. Plus, a handy bar at the bottom lets you drop comments or reactions without missing a beat.</p><p>Android Authority managed to get this feature up and running and even shared a demo to show how it works in real life.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uboynFivFTc" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><h2 id="lost-media-no-more-digging-2">Lost media? No more digging</h2><p>While swiping through media is a bit more helpful, it won’t cut it for digging up older stuff. That’s why Google is adding a dedicated media overview you can find in the chat details. Tap the new “Images” section, and you’ll get a neat timeline of every photo and video shared, kind of like what you see in some of our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-text-messaging-apps">favorite messaging apps</a>, such as WhatsApp.</p><p>These tweaks might seem small to most, but if you’re always swapping pics and videos, they’ll make a big difference. And Google has been on this grind for a while—earlier this year, it was already testing threaded replies for media, so it’s clear Google wants to make Messages way better for handling visuals.</p><p>It’s still in the works, but it could drop for everyone in the next few months. Either way, it’s shaping up to be a solid upgrade.</p> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Chargeasap is a new accessory manufacturer that's doing good things with charging tech. I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/power-charging/chargeasap-flash-pro-ultra-25000mah-275w-power-bank-that-does-it-all">tested the Flash Pro Ultra</a> a few weeks ago, and the 25,000mAh power bank held its own against Anker and UGREEN's offerings. The brand also sent over its GaN charger, and I've been using it for the better part of a month now.</p><p>The Zeus ticks all the right boxes: it has four charging ports in total, going up to 140W individually and delivering a total power budget of 280W. That's considerably more than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/ugreen-nexode-pro-gan-chargers-launch">UGREEN Nexode Pro</a> I use while traveling, which hits 160W in total. Another feature I like is that the Zeus has a built-in panel that shows real-time charging details, and this is quite handy — I normally rely on USB-C cables with integrated power meters to see these details.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5121px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.34%;"><img id="TKxccBWr5E8LeTmBYxrNKf" name="Chargeasap Zeus" alt="Chargeasap Zeus 280W GaN charger review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TKxccBWr5E8LeTmBYxrNKf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5121" height="2885" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The downside is the cost; the Zeus <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://chargeasap.com/products/270w-zeus-charger">retails for $219 in the U.S.</a>, and that's more than twice the cost of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Charger-Compact-MacBook-Pixelbook/dp/B0CCVPB4PC">160W Nexode Pro</a>. Clearly, Chargeasap is positioning the additional features as a key selling point of the charger, and it has other niceties — you get a set of plugs in the box that allows the charger to double a global travel plug that can be used anywhere, and that brings much-needed versatility.</p><h2 id="the-zeus-has-unmatched-versatility-2">The Zeus has unmatched versatility</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="ZYcwZw6YyMBktHNQCJopYf" name="Chargeasap Zeus" alt="Chargeasap Zeus 280W GaN charger review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZYcwZw6YyMBktHNQCJopYf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Basically, this is an all-in-one GaN charger that works anywhere in the world, and with the higher power budget, you'll only need the Zeus to charge all of your devices on the go. On that note, the charger is smaller and lighter than most options in this category; a decent achievement considering you're not missing out on any features.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5075px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="weaVod2egrMRdLtAUNGRNf" name="Chargeasap Zeus" alt="Chargeasap Zeus 280W GaN charger review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/weaVod2egrMRdLtAUNGRNf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5075" height="2859" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The rectangular design is easily portable, and I like that the Zeus comes in a white color variant; far too many chargers are just sold in a grey or black color, and the white model stands out. Coming in at 320g, it doesn't weigh too much either, and you get a pouch that holds the travel plugs and the charger with relative ease.</p><h2 id="it-s-designed-to-charge-all-your-devices-at-once-2">It's designed to charge all your devices at once</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5134px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="3W7N9jPsr7smaBdhznFRNf" name="Chargeasap Zeus" alt="Chargeasap Zeus 280W GaN charger review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3W7N9jPsr7smaBdhznFRNf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5134" height="2892" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Coming to connectivity, the Zeus has a single USB-A port that goes up to 65W, and three USB-C ports. The main and secondary USB-C connectors hit 140W over the USB PD 3.1 protocol, and the other port maxes out at 100W. What I like the most is the integrated OLED panel; it shows real-time charging info, and it makes all the difference if you're charging several devices at once — like I do all the time.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="5bAvaF5FRph2dxGCUvWYUf" name="Chargeasap Zeus" alt="Chargeasap Zeus 280W GaN charger review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5bAvaF5FRph2dxGCUvWYUf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The charger has foldable blade plugs as standard, and you can slot in U.K., Australia, and an angled two pin connector if you're traveling. Build quality is great, and I didn't see any issues with the Zeus in the month I used it. It tends to get a little hot when all ports are in use, but that is the case with all GaN chargers, and it doesn't overheat.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="8wTyyDKHsRQ6J2ffvpTXUf" name="Chargeasap Zeus" alt="Chargeasap Zeus 280W GaN charger review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8wTyyDKHsRQ6J2ffvpTXUf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The USB-C port handles PPS up to 65W, making it a good choice if you've got a Samsung device. Interestingly, the USB-A port has the VOOC charging protocol, but it's limited to 22.5W, and I was able to charge the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/oppo-find-x8-ultra-review">Find X8 Ultra</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">Find N5</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-13s-review">OnePlus 13s</a> with relative ease. Of course, you can also use the regular USB-C PD connectivity with these devices now, but if you've got an older BBK phone, the Zeus is definitely handy.</p><h2 id="all-the-power-you-need-anywhere-you-want-it-2">All the power you need — anywhere you want it</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4936px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="3eW9TLroiJtXNxPUtiwn8f" name="Chargeasap Zeus" alt="Chargeasap Zeus 280W GaN charger review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3eW9TLroiJtXNxPUtiwn8f.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4936" height="2780" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another differentiator is that the Zeus is able to handle charging two 140W devices at the same time. That is a big deal, and it allows the charger to go up to 280W in total. This is the rundown of the power budget you get with the Zeus:</p><ul><li><strong>USB-C1/C2 out (140W max):</strong> 5V/3A (15W), 9V/3A (27W), 12V/3A (36W), 15V/3A (45W), 20V/5A (100W), 28V/5A (140W)</li><li><strong>USB-C3 out (100W max): </strong>5V/3A (15W), 9V/3A (27W), 12V/3A (36W), 15V/3A (45W), 20V/5A (100W)</li><li><strong>USB-A out (65W max):</strong> 5V/3A (15W), 4.5V/5A (22.5W), 5V/4.5A (22.5W), 9V/3A (27W), 12V/3A (36W), 15V/3A (45W), 20V/3.25A (65W)</li><li><strong>USB-C1 + C2 out (280W max):</strong> 140W + 140W</li><li><strong>USB-C1/C2 + USB-C3 (240W max): </strong>140W + 100W</li><li><strong>USB-C1 + C2 + C3 (270W max): </strong>140W + 65W + 65W</li><li><strong>USB-C1/C2 + USB-A (205W max): </strong>140W + 65W</li><li><strong>USB-C1 + C2 + USB-A (270W max):</strong> 140W + 65W + 65W</li><li><strong>USB-C1 + C2 + C3 + USB-A (255W max):</strong> 140W + 100W + 15W</li></ul><p>The charging potential is a key advantage, and I was able to use the Zeus with my Honor MagicBook Pro 16, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x200-ultra-review">Vivo X200 Ultra</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-ipad-pro-m4-13-inch-long-term-review">iPad Pro M4</a>, and over a dozen accessories without any issues. The charger delivered consistent power, and I didn't see any issues whatsoever in this regard.</p><p>To sum up, the extensive feature-set combined with 280W power budget means the Zeus is now my go-to choice as a travel GaN charger. It has all the accessories I need while traveling, and having an OLED panel lets me see how long it takes to charge all connected devices. It is on the costlier side, but you also get double the charging potential of most GaN chargers available today, and that's an achievement in and of itself.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="242b11d8-98d6-4d4e-b2be-cf3de8fa92c8">            <a href="https://chargeasap.com/products/270w-zeus-charger" data-model-name="Chargeasap Zeus 280W GaN Charger"><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:102.95%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dNGmon3jovSdW5wpZ9f6YX.jpg' alt="Chargeasap Zeus"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Chargeasap Zeus 280W GaN Charger</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>With all the power you need and a portable design that works globally, the Zeus is one of the best GaN chargers you can buy today. </p></p>                </div>                <div class="pro-con"></div>            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

But the clock is ticking on Samsung's "free" AI features. And at some point, Galaxy Watch owners may have to ask themselves whether they're willing to pay for the best version of Samsung Health.</p><p>It started last year when Samsung revealed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> and wearable insights like Energy Score and AI-based Wellness Tips for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Watch 7</a>. It promised at the time that its AI tricks "will be provided for free until the end of 2025 on supported Samsung Galaxy devices."</p><p>At the January Unpacked, Samsung revealed a much longer list of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/im-more-excited-about-galaxy-unpacked-samsung-health-features-than-galaxy-s25">AI-based health features</a> coming this summer: Vascular Load tracking to determine daily "strain on your heart," a "personal health coach" for LLM-based "insights" for your health questions, an "antioxidant index" with "tailored meal plans and recipes," and mood check-ins.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:64.97%;"><img id="RRQnekYhcCfDoP7UzSmjtC" name="Galaxy-Unpacked-Vascular-Load-example" alt="The Vascular load (Labs) submenu in Samsung Health that shows your heart's activity level from day to day, as well as a summary of the data: "Steady: Your vascular load is consistent.

And we can expect even more, based on this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/one-ui-8-feature-runners-virtual-coach-guidance-rumor">recent leak</a> about a Samsung "Running Coach" that'll have you run for 12 minutes to judge your fitness baseline and then build a "personalized training plan" for you.</p><p>Additionally, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/my-8-favorite-things-about-the-one-ui-8-beta" target="_blank">One UI 8 beta</a> introduced food log reminders and a "Together" feature that challenges your friends to match your weekly running distance.</p><p>Until we hear otherwise, all of this should be free for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8</a> owners. I've been waiting for Samsung to pair its dual-band GPS accuracy with better running guidance and an equivalent to the training load info that Garmin, Apple, and Fitbit offer. That's why the Running Coach-Vascular Load combo sounds tantalizing.</p><p>My worry, though, is that this is all bait on the hook for an eventual Samsung subscription. I could easily see Samsung building up its stockpile of health tools before making a Fitbit Premium or Google One AI equivalent very soon.</p><h2 id="waiting-for-the-other-shoe-to-drop-2">Waiting for the other shoe to drop</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="aicnph6WTXLfmFefVdmFdh" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-and-Watch-6-Classic" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic (left) sitting atop the Galaxy Watch Ultra (right)." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aicnph6WTXLfmFefVdmFdh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In an ideal world, we'd trust that Samsung simply wants to improve its app to make it more competitive against Apple Health, as a boon for people who pay for its products.

Garmin, in particular, held back on releasing new features so that it could shove them all into its subscription and mitigate profit losses from tariffs.</p><p>I'd guess Samsung is taking the reverse approach: It wants to hook us with free Galaxy AI perks, then throw them behind a paywall and deal with the blowback then. After all, it did <em>warn</em> us it would charge for AI eventually.</p><p>Perhaps I'm worrying over nothing, and we'll still receive free auto-generated nutrition plans, running plans, and the health coach's services even after 2025. However, Samsung will examine its health and AI competitors, which charge $10–20 per month, and see that its customers have few alternatives left to turn to.</p><p>If Samsung starts to paywall even some of these tools in 2026, it'll make the Samsung Health experience <em>very</em> different, closer to the free, watered-down version of Fitbit.</p><h2 id="would-you-pay-for-a-samsung-health-subscription-2">Would you pay for a Samsung Health subscription?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CNFEsF8R8aG7BJUiZccGnK" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-ui-8-beta-1-running-together" alt="The Together feature in the Samsung Health app on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CNFEsF8R8aG7BJUiZccGnK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Maybe this speculation is premature. But when I saw that rumor about the Samsung Health Running Coach, exactly what I'd been waiting for, I had to remind myself to look this gift horse in the mouth before letting myself geek out. It's AI-generated, like the other new features.</p><p>I could see Samsung offering one overall Galaxy AI plan for all your devices, similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One</a> AI Pro plan. Or else it could keep the phone AI subscription separate from the Samsung Health Coach subscription.</p><p>So let's assume that Samsung Health goes from a free app to a paywalled one sometime next year. Are you excited enough by AI coaching, nutrition, and health data that you'd pay for it after the free trial ended? Would you continue using Samsung Health but ignore the AI tricks entirely? Or would a paywall push you to look elsewhere for a different fitness app?</p> ]]></dc:content>

Because of the way Android is developed and distributed, you've always been able to build it yourself, to your own specifications.</p><p>Let's be honest, though; it was fun for some people, but traditionally it's been a pain in the ass that few people are able to do. Troubleshooting cryptic commands to build some software overnight that might not even work is something most people don't feel like even trying. I don't blame anyone; it can be a headache, no matter how fun you might find it.</p><p>The good news is that you don't have to do it yourself any longer, and companies like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-murena-one-is-pure-android-not-pure-google">Murena</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/eos-review-privacy-focused-android-without-google">e-foundation</a> are doing all the hard work for you. And you know what? They make a really damn good product, one I think everyone needs to check out for themselves, and it's called /e/OS.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yB5aSK3ZTrZcPkks9nxJVL" name="Murena-Fairphone-4.jpg" alt="Murena Fairphone 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yB5aSK3ZTrZcPkks9nxJVL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Murena)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I don't hate Google. The company does a lot of things I don't like, but it also does a lot of things I do like. I choose to embrace Android for a reason: I think it's the best commercially available platform and offers the most choice, so the things you buy do what you want them to do.</p><p>When you take the best parts of Android and work to turn it into software built for users instead of financial gain, the results are amazing. With the release of /e/OS 3, it's reached the point where it's a good choice for everyone.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pVoaO6sFXZs" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>You have access to every feature you can think of that doesn't require a giant tech company to act as an overseer. Secure cloud backup? It's there. An intuitive interface that can be customized to work best for you? That's there, too.</p><p>So are all the apps you love because it's Android; you can even access a network tool to help you find your phone when you lose it, without Google or Apple shepherding how you're doing it. While the software has been more than usable for a while, the latest version takes the final step. It's as good or better than Google's Android or iOS.</p><p>There are two reasons why now is the perfect time to check out what /e/OS has to offer. First, and most important to a lot of us, is that you probably won't have to spend any money.</p><p>The software is designed to run really well on modest hardware (remember when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-go">Android was that way</a>?), so it will likely work with your last phone if you didn't trade it in for something new and shiny. It will even work well on phones as old as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-pixel-november-update-squashes-the-first-round-of-android-15-bugs">first Google Pixel</a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-5-specs">OnePlus 5</a>. You can find a list of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://doc.e.foundation/devices" target="_blank">221 supported models here</a>, but if you do have a few dollars to spend, you can also buy it preloaded on phones from Murena and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/fairphone-5-ifixit-perfect-repairability-score">Fairphone</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1851px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="GUCSaY8eKAjJMzgxZsQBT" name="e-os-3-smartphone" alt="/e/OS 3 on a smartphone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GUCSaY8eKAjJMzgxZsQBT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1851" height="1041" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Murena)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You can also trust the software, much more than you can trust anything else. I'm not saying you shouldn't trust Google, Apple, or Samsung, but /e/OS is 100% open-source, and an entire development community pores through the code to make sure it does exactly what it is advertised to do. Nothing more, nothing less.</p><p>A good portion of Android is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/aosp" target="_blank">still that way</a>, but much of what you'll find in a new phone comes from Google or the company that made it, and they aren't sharing how it works. To know exactly what a Google Pixel can do, you have to either be part of the development team or trust the development team.</p><p>To know exactly what an /e/OS phone can do, you simply need to read what is made freely available to everyone. No marketing team or sales division is acting as a middleman between you and what you want to know.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1678px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:57.63%;"><img id="4nWrBwRHNS8YAn5VeyQRkA" name="AOSP.jpg" alt="AOSP" src="https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4nWrBwRHNS8YAn5VeyQRkA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1678" height="967" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Trying it is easy, too. You will need a computer with sufficient space to download the installer and files themselves; the process is straightforward. Make sure your phone is up to date, works, and has a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-cables-android-auto">USB cable</a> plugged in. The simple installer walks you through everything else.</p><p>But maybe you're not ready to leave Google or Apple behind, and that's fine. Both companies offer great reasons to buy their products and are a good choice for everyone on most fronts.</p><p>If you're interested in privacy, having a little more control over your digital life, or even curious about what else is out there, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://e.foundation/e-os/" target="_blank">head over to the e-foundation</a> and have a look. I think you'll like what you find.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The video gives viewers a peek into his memorable moments, as he shares stories looking back at some of his photos.</p><p>A short snippet of the video has been doing the rounds on TikTok, where Chan shows off his Pandas to the world. While these Pandas are definitely adorable, what caught our attention was the phone he was using. It looks like one of the latest foldable devices, due to the obviously visible hinge in the center.</p><p>When we looked a little closer, we saw that the phone is small enough to be held in one hand, and sleek too, when unfolded.</p>                    <blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@people/video/7511799977451080990" data-video-id="7511799977451080990" style="max-width: 605px; min-width: 325px;">                        <section>                            <a target="_blank" title="@people" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@people">@people</a>                            <p></p><a target="_blank" title="♬ Lofi - Domknowz" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/Lofi-6799585653702019073">♬ Lofi - Domknowz</a></section>                    </blockquote>                <p>The device's form factor has led us to believe that it could either be the Huawei Mate X6 or the Honor Magic V3. Upon comparing screenshots from the video clip with his Honor Magic V3, Android Central's Nick Sutrich noted that they appeared to be identical phones. He specifically pointed out the battery icon, hinge piece, and corners of the device as being a match to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review">Honor Magic V3</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, others on the team speculate that Jackie Chan actually uses the Huawei Mate X6. It's a bummer that we don't get to see the rear panel of the device; it would've made it easier to guess. As for why we think it's mostly a Huawei Mate X6, it's because Chan has a history of owning Huawei phones.</p><p>The actor has been spotted using Huawei phones since 2016, and in 2019, when a fan gave Jackie a Huawei phone at an event, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://cnalifestyle.channelnewsasia.com/8days/jackie-chan-seen-buying-huawei-phone-once-said-all-chinese-people-should-use-chinese-products-429166">he reportedly pulled out three Huawei phones</a> and said, “I use Huawei and have several of them. Chinese people should use domestic products.

Chan was seen browsing through different models and inquiring about them with Huawei staff.</p><p>According to someone present at the store, the actor wanted to buy the newly launched Mate 60  but was told it was out of stock and could only be pre-ordered. Later, he ended up getting the Huawei Mate X3. Considering Jackie Chan's fascination with the brand, our speculation is leaning towards the fact that the actor owns the new Huawei Mate X6, which was launched in November 2024.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Fortunately, most mobile service providers offer their customers some degree of international coverage, you just need to choose the data plan that works for you (and your budget). </p><p>Up until recently, only the most expensive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/best-unlimited-data-plans">unlimited plans</a> gave users international coverage, but that's swiftly changing as the wireless landscape gets more competitive. The Big Three (Verizon, T-Mobile, and AT&T) already include roaming in Mexico and Canada, but if you want faster speeds or data outside of North America, you'll need to do a little research. Fortunately, whether you're looking to join a Big Three or keep it simple with one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-mvno-carrier">best MVNO carriers</a>, I've gathered all of the best data plans for international travel below.  </p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-at-a-glance"><span>At a glance</span></h3>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_hero" data-id="f1815a52-74d5-492e-96b2-a064b4df3bca">            <a href="https://www.verizon.com/plans/unlimited/" data-model-name="1.

You start by choosing a plan at a base price, and then you mix and match perks based on your needs any given month, each of which cost $10 per month. This can be super convenient if you have a trip coming up, because you can easily plan ahead by adding perks like TravelPass and hotspot data without any real commitment beyond the month in question. </p><p>The Unlimited Ultimate plan also gives you unlimited talk, text, and 15GB of high-speed data in over 200 countries worldwide. Once the 15GB runs out, you'll still get unlimited data at 1.5 Mbps, which is more than sufficient for most simple tasks. With a starting price of $90/month, the Unlimited Ultimate plan can be pretty expensive if you're just signing up for one line, although the price drops considerably when you bring the family along.</p><p>Alternatively, you could also sign up for a more affordable Verizon plan and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.verizon.com/plans/international/international-travel/travel-pass/"><strong>simply use TravelPass</strong></a>. This feature costs $12/day and gives you unlimited talk, text, and data in over 200 countries. Once you add TravelPass to your Verizon account, you'll only be charged for the days you actually use the service, which can come in handy if you generally rely on Wi-Fi calling when overseas. </p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-budget"><span>Best budget</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:801px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:52.06%;"><img id="iW3ezBdsDXPBMzSRVTddME" name="visible-smile-169.JPG" alt="Visible smile logo on phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iW3ezBdsDXPBMzSRVTddME.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="801" height="417" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Visible)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="2-visible-plus-pro-2"><span class="title__text"><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/visible-review">2.

You also get 4K UHD streaming quality, unlimited mobile hotspot data, and a five-year price guarantee so you won't have to worry about your phone bill suddenly getting more expensive. </p><p>Travelers will enjoy free talk, text, and 2GB of data in Mexico, Canada, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands, after which speeds will begin to slow. Subscribers to the Plus Pro plan will also get two days of Global Pass every month, which gives you unlimited talk, text, and 2GB of high-speed data in over 140 countries worldwide. That may not seem very generous, but you can also save up to 12 of these unused Global Pass days to use when traveling, which is pretty good for only $45 per month. Alternatively, you can pay for the annual version of the Visible Plus Pro plan and receive 24 Global Pass days to use at your convenience. Global Pass can also be purchased a la carte for $10 per day. </p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-premium"><span>Best premium</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1990px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="BvTcxLK4iRKgLdiYgUZd9T" name="T-Mobile-Store.jpeg" alt="T-Mobile store sign" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BvTcxLK4iRKgLdiYgUZd9T.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1990" height="1119" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="3-t-mobile-experience-beyond-2"><span class="title__text">3.

There are also a few surprising perks that I haven't seen anywhere else, such as free in-flight Wi-Fi and discounted hotels and rental cars if you book through T-Mobile Travel. International calling will still cost $0.25 per minute, but it's easy enough to just use Wi-Fi calling when you're overseas. </p><p>The problem is that the Experience Beyond plan is quite expensive, costing over $100 per month for a single line.

It's also home to Unlimited Premium, an interesting data plan that offers users a bounty of compelling perks, such as 100GB of Cloud storage, six months of YouTube Premium streaming, free service on select <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">smartwatches</a>, and more. </p><p>The plan also offers a bunch of international benefits that may sound familiar if you read up on T-Mobile's Experience Beyond plan. I'm talking about unlimited text and 50GB of high-speed data (then 256 kbps) in over 200 destinations worldwide, plus free calls, texts, and data in Mexico and Canada. Use a 5G-compatible <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> and you'll even get 5G service in over 90 of the aforementioned countries. </p><p>Google Fi's Unlimited Premium plan starts at $65 per month for a single line, but you'll save some cash by adding up to four lines on your account. All things said and done, it's a pretty reasonable price for what you get, as long as you don't rack up costs overseas with those $0.20/minute phone calls.</p><ul><li><a href="#main"><strong>Back to the top^</strong></a></li></ul><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-choose"><span>How to choose</span></h3><p>There are plenty of great <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cell-phone-plans">phone plans</a> for folks who regularly travel abroad, but that doesn't mean that there's a one-size-fits-all solution. Before you settle on one plan, it's important to consider your needs as a device user, your budget, and of course, your destination. </p><p>For starters, it's best to look at your current wireless plan and see what it offers. Do you only need talk and text on your travels? If so, how much? Do you need data for navigation or surfing the web? Asking yourself these questions is a great place to start when choosing a plan for your journey. And who knows, maybe your carrier already has a great option that'll work for you. </p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vBJsLpu2HdkkTFV4avmuSi" name="visible-sim-card-passport-hero.jpeg" alt="Visible SIM card sitting on top of US passport" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vBJsLpu2HdkkTFV4avmuSi.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you can't get coverage from within your destination of choice, you could also look into your carrier's Wi-Fi calling policy. Wi-Fi is readily available in most countries across the globe, and if you don't frequently send texts or use data while traveling, it could be sufficient for your needs abroad.</p><p>Another piece of advice I'd offer is to watch out for <em>how </em>carriers describe their international coverage. For example, there's a big difference between "free calls <em><strong>in </strong></em>XX countries" and "free calls <em><strong>to </strong></em>XX countries". Both are useful perks, but they mean very different things. One will let you make calls from inside another country, while the latter example means that you can only call other countries from <em>inside the United States. </em>It may seem like an obvious distinction, but it's easy to get mixed up if you aren't careful. </p><p>Lastly, it's important to remember that many carriers offer international coverage a la carte, so you may not need to switch to an entirely new plan to use your provider's network overseas. Verizon, for instance, offers TravelPass in over 210 countries worldwide. It costs just $12 per day and can easily be activated on any of Verizon's data plans.</p> ]]></dc:content>

There's an entire category of headphones and earbuds you may not be as familiar with: sleep headphones. These products can simultaneously block out unwanted sounds and play your favorite music, podcasts, or white noise to ensure you get a perfect night sleep, whether you're in your bed or on a flight overseas.</p><p>If you've ever tried wearing some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">best wireless earbuds</a> to bed, you probably know that regular earbuds aren't that comfortable for sleep. That's why <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/quieton-31-sleep-earbuds-review">sleep earbuds</a>, sleep headbands, and sleep over-ears exist — they are designed specifically for comfort in all sleeping positions. Most sleep earbuds are characterized by a low-profile design that rests within your ear canal, while open earbuds, sleep headbands, and sleep over-ears avoid it altogether.</p><p>There are a bunch of different reasons for why you might want to wear a pair of earbuds or headphones to sleep. Maybe you sleep with someone who snores or live next to a noisy train station. While traveling, you might want to block out airplane turbulence or car noise to catch some sleep. Whatever your needs are, these best sleep headphones and earbuds will help you get the perfect night's sleep.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_hero" data-id="5916d48b-4a68-46fc-b4b0-10c19d48d9d5">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9YcaTcDkUmB766JceRMYbk.jpg' alt="A product render of the Anker Soundcore Sleep A20 against a white background."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Anker Soundcore Sleep A20</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Best overall</strong></em></p><p>Anker's Soundcore Sleep A20 hit all the right notes, providing comfort and battery life at an affordable price point. The earbuds' low profile mean people can wear them to sleep regardless of their sleeping position, including side sleepers. In sleep mode, the Sleep A20 can last for 14 hours straight, for a total of 80 hours with the charging case. You also get a digital sound library of sleep sounds and Bluetooth 5.3 support for playing anything you'd like. </p></p>                </div>                <div class="pro-con"></div>            </div>        </div>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_hero" data-id="a9a91468-b2aa-411b-a4e8-82929eca031e">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AAnMyexpeTfzZok2vd3cJh.jpg' alt="The Anker Soundcore Sleep A10 product render against a white background."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Anker Soundcore Sleep A10</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Best budget pick</strong></em></p><p>If you like the Soundcore Sleep A20 but wish they were a bit cheaper, the Sleep A10 are your perfect sleepbuds. They're slim and designed for side sleepers just like the newer model, and are cheaper. With a more modest 10-hour battery life in sleep mode, these will still get you through the night. Passive noise canceling and low-frequency audio production help make this a great budget choice for a good night's sleep. </p></p>                </div>                <div class="pro-con"></div>            </div>        </div>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_hero" data-id="5c157a94-f31e-4386-aa63-251797532c7b">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/szqDkb46mgzcshziHwHpU9.jpg' alt="The Ozlo Sleepbuds product render against a white background."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Ozlo Sleepbuds</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Best premium pick</strong></em></p><p>For those who want the absolute best sleep earbuds, there are the Ozlo Sleepbuds.

You also get the versatility of Bluetooth 5.0, so you can play anything. </p></p>                </div>                <div class="pro-con"></div>            </div>        </div>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_hero" data-id="da14264a-ec36-4506-8379-9b2a6cd6ffa6">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4uieFX5MgKGvbDAahtBHrG.jpg' alt="The black Sonos Ace headphones in a product render against a white background."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Sonos Ace</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Best sleep over-ears</strong></em></p><p>For sleep in a plane, train, or car, over-ears may be a more comfortable solution than earbuds. The Sonos Ace are a versatile pair of ANC headphones that can be used for everyday use and to catch some sleep. Memory foam and vegan leather make up the earcups and headband for an extremely satisfying fit. A lengthy 30-hour battery life with ANC active makes these an excellent choice for long-haul flights and trips. </p></p>                </div>                <div class="pro-con"></div>            </div>        </div><ul><li><a href="#main"><strong>Back to the top ^</strong></a></li></ul><h2 id="how-to-choose-one-of-the-best-sleep-headphones-in-2025-2">How to choose one of the best sleep headphones in 2025</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Q4pRhV7ncQ6A7mdcHSgFQP" name="Sonos-Ace-in-hand.jpg" alt="Carrying Sonos Ace headphones from headband." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Q4pRhV7ncQ6A7mdcHSgFQP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Not everyone has the same sleeping preferences, so not everyone will like the same sleep earbuds. The closest thing to a one-size-fits-all solution are the Anker Soundcore Sleep A20, which are affordable and comfortable sleepbuds aimed to fit in a variety of sleeping styles. They have neat tech inside, including an MEMS electrical sensor to track your sleep and create a quality score. With these earbuds, you may be able to ditch your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">smartwatch</a> or fitness band.</p><p>The Sleep A20 earbuds come with a pre-loaded sleep sound library, but also work as standard Bluetooth earbuds. In sleep mode, you can get up to 14 hours of battery life on a single charge — that's more than enough for even the longest snooze sessions. At $160, the Anker Soundcore Sleep A20 strike a nice balance between premium features and affordability.</p><p>Those on a budget might prefer the Anker Soundcore Sleep A10, the older model that's available for a $30 discount, sometimes more. It still offers solid battery life and features aimed to help you get a good night's sleep.</p><p>On the other end of the spectrum, there are the Ozlo Sleepbuds, which cost a lump sum of $350. For that, you get a premium set of earbuds and a companion charging case with a bunch of sensors and features. The earbuds include a sleep-detecting accelerometer, and the case offers a tap detection, ambient noise detection, an ambient temperature sensor, and an ambient light sensor. All these factors can be used to determine your quality of sleep, and a built-in alarm helps you wake up.</p><p>Plus, you get Bluetooth Low Energy support for ultra-low power draw and Android features like Auracast. Though, for many, the price is too high with limited feature advantages compared to the Sleep A20.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rPyAhMqzK2ox3a94gBShWZ" name="nothing-ear-open-cu-in-hand-cu.jpg" alt="Nothing Ear (open)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rPyAhMqzK2ox3a94gBShWZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Having anything in your ear can be uncomfortable for some sleepers. If that sounds like you, we have some outside-the-box picks for favorable sleeping environments. For starters, you can consider the SleepPhones — a headband that covers your eyes and sports inbuilt speakers for media playback outside your ear canal.</p><p>There are also the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/nothing-ear-open-review">Nothing Ear Open</a>, which are open-ear buds that remain outside your ear canal. They're bulkier than the other in-ear options, but can be used in a variety of situations, like fitness and everyday wear. Side sleepers should pass on the Nothing Ear Open, but they're an excellent option for people who sleep on their back or stomach. Side sleepers can also opt to only wear one earbuds for a more relaxing experience.</p><p>A pair of over-ear headphones can come in handy for sleeping in upright positions, making them an amazing choice for airplane trips, train rides, and long road trips. For that, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sonos-ace-review">Sonos Ace</a> are impossible to beat. They feature comfortable memory foam and vegan leather materials for comfortability and aren't too heavy. Plus, you get active noise-canceling — most in-ear sleepbuds only use passive sound isolation.</p><p>With USB-C and a 30-hour battery life with ANC active, the Sonos Ace can be your travel companion every step of the way. They're a great pair of everyday headphones, too.</p><p>When choosing a pair of sleep headphones, you should consider whether you're willing to spend money on a dedicated care of night earbuds. If you aren't, the Nothing Ear Open or Sonos Ace may be a more value-oriented option, as they can be used all day <em>and</em> all night. Regardless, you can't go wrong with any of the headphones or earbuds on this list for sleep.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Google says these auxiliary systems will include users with a video production tool, an external camera, or a document camera. What's bringing this capability is a new option within your <strong>Settings > General </strong>tab.</p><p>Users will find a new "Share content from camera" toggle. After enabling, users should find their external cameras within the Presentation icon's "Camera" option in a meeting.</p><p>Google threw in something extra, stating its support for external cameras will bring 1080p and 30fps streaming quality.</p><p>While sharing external content becomes easier, Google Meet's update adds extra improvements for device-based presentations. The post states screen shares will have upgraded video quality, which improves the viewing experience when the presenter is scrolling or showing a video. Starting a screen share becomes faster, alongside a small UI update to make starting presentations and controlling them easier.</p><p>Google ends by stating a small QoL update lets an older presentation resume if a second presenter ends their sharing session.</p><h2 id="google-meet-s-in-the-spotlight-2">Google Meet's in the Spotlight</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1047px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:57.31%;"><img id="exPxz2Jc6wy6MWCyfnrs7A" name="google-meet-share-content-from-camera-example" alt="Google Meet's latest update brings a "share content from camera" option for external camera use." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/exPxz2Jc6wy6MWCyfnrs7A.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1047" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1036px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:57.92%;"><img id="swrbG79YWSHtD5LgQ9kZ8A" name="google-meet-external-camera-selection-ui" alt="Google's external camera update for Meet lets users select which camera to use when beginning a presentation." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/swrbG79YWSHtD5LgQ9kZ8A.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1036" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>It seems this update isn't coming to regular end-users, as Google's patch notes only highlight Workspace users. Those with Business, Enterprise, Frontline (Standard), Enterprise Essentials and Enterprise Essentials Plus, Education Plus, and individual Workspace consumers will see these Meet updates.</p><p>Those on Google's rapid-release domain will see the update beginning this week (June 4), while those on the Scheduled-release domain will begin on June 11. The update should wrap up in ~15 days for both domains.</p><p>Google's been improving the Meet experience since earlier this year when an update for Android brought a redesign and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-mixed-things-up-with-its-meet-redesign">a spotlight on emoji reactions</a>. The company said that update from February is designed to "organize features more intuitively." Moreover, emoji reactions took a front row seat during conference calls, so users can quickly react without playing with menus.</p><p>For computers, Google Meet started rolling out its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-meet-color-sampling-tile-redesign-rolls-out">classy new tile design</a> for callers in April. Meet now utilizes its "color-sampling" capabilities to grab colors from your profile picture and apply them to your card's background. It's also worth mentioning that Google Meet will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-meet-to-sunset-legacy-duo-features-in-september">soon sunset all legacy Duo features</a> in September.

Until now, Nothing has only produced earbuds since launching its first phone.</p><p>While we don't really know what these headphones would look like or what the specs might be, sometime last month, Nothing's design team got to chatting in a YouTube video, and the team broke down what they’re after, though they’re still keeping all the main specs a mystery.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just stepped off stage at @sxswlondon, a massive thanks to @lucyhedges for hosting the session.We discussed how we’ve built @Nothing by breaking the rules: ✖️ No copy-paste features ✖️ No corporate fluff ✔️ Just beautifully bold design, genuine community co-creation, and a… pic.twitter.com/dw90clG8Ea<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1930601394668487038">June 5, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>In Pei's X post, he stated that Nothing was built with "no copy-paste features," and is  "genuine community co-creation, and a belief that tech should feel different."  Then further added that the Nothing Headphone (1) is coming very soon.</p><p>"Our first over-ear headphones are launching on July 1. A whole new product category for us as we continue to level up audio in 2025," Pei confirmed.</p><p>What we do know about these headphones is that Nothing is aiming to give this over-ear accessory high-end sound with its recent collaboration with one of the UK's most iconic brands, KEF, to bring "in sound innovation and bring refined audio experiences to a broader audience."</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://international.kef.com/blogs/news/nothing-kef-audio-partnership">KEF collab press release</a> also subtly hinted at the fact that Nothing's audio products launching later this year will mark the beginning of an "exciting new chapter for the future of Nothing Audio.”</p><p>Nothing’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/nothing-is-talking-big-for-its-debut-over-ear-headphones-landing-this-summer">designers want these over-ears to scream style</a>, as they feel that most over-ear headphones out there are pretty boring when it comes to looks. They also hinted that they're getting "feel-by-touch" controls, suggesting that users will always end up hitting the button they need to on the Headphones 1.</p> ]]></dc:content>

However, to combat this, Samsung developed software to "detect" signs of sleep apnea via the Galaxy Watch, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-expands-global-availability-of-sleep-apnea-feature-on-galaxy-watch-series">that's now rolling out to more people</a> globally. In a blog post, the Korean OEM states its sleep apnea detection feature on the Galaxy Watch is arriving via the Samsung Health Monitor app in 34 European markets.</p><p>The company warns that "availability may vary depending on country-specific registration in some European markets."</p><p>Samsung states this is possible due to the feature's recent reception of CE marking in the European Economic Area. This marking states the Galaxy Watch's sleep apnea feature has met the European Union's health, safety, and environmental standards for consumers.</p><p>More than that, Samsung is bringing sleep apnea detection to users in Australia and Singapore. The company states it also had to walk through the appropriate governmental processes in order to bring the feature here, as well. The feature has obtained clearance via Singapore’s Health Sciences Authority and the Therapeutic Goods Administration in Australia.</p><p>Consumers in these regions with a Galaxy Watch 4 series device <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-hands-on">or newer</a> (with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> or higher) will have access to Sleep Apnea.</p><h2 id="improving-sleep-2">Improving Sleep</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:907px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.15%;"><img id="cFLw2jEqX3jvMiHKepaLyX" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-sleep-apnea-global-expansion" alt="Samsung's Sleep Apnea feature present on a Galaxy Watch." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cFLw2jEqX3jvMiHKepaLyX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="907" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung's been on a journey to improve users' sleep health via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-could-detect-blood-pressure-sleep-apnea-like-galaxy-watch">this Sleep Apnea feature since 2023</a>. It was then that the Korean OEM announced its sleep health feature had successfully passed through South Korea's Ministry of Food and Drug Safety. This meant the feature could launch on supported Galaxy Watches in the country as soon as "early 2024."</p><p>The Sleep Apnea feature leverages the Galaxy Watch's BioActive Sensor to alert users to potential signs of the medical condition. While Samsung says it is useful, it's not recommended for those who've already been diagnosed with sleep apnea.</p><p>Luckily for U.S. folks, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-sleep-apnea-detection-us-fda-approval">the FDA passed Samsung's feature</a> through, meaning it could arrive on Galaxy Watches in the States. That announcement stated the feature could be utilized by consumers aged 22 or older; however, there's a requirement for the watch. If you're interested, you must wear your Galaxy Watch to bed as often as possible. Samsung says the device needs to track your sleep for more than four hours within a ten-day timespan.</p><ul><li><strong>Smartwatch deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/searchpage.jsp?st=smartwatch&_dyncharset=UTF-8&_dynSessConf=&id=pcat17071&type=page&sc=Global&cp=1&nrp=&sp=&qp=&list=n&af=true&iht=y&usc=All+Categories&ks=960&keys=keys"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/search?q=smartwatch"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=smartwatch&crid=19YAPQ38561AK&sprefix=smartwatch%2Caps%2C138&ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_1_10"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/watches-audio-accessories-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/search/smartwatch"><u><strong>Dell</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Currently, Call Notes will automatically play a spoken message explaining to the person on the other end of the call that it is being recording. Soon, that might change, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-phone-call-notes-toggle-teardown-3564540/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> reports users could be able to turn off this spoken message in a future update.</p><p>The team at Android Authority tore down <strong>version 178.0.765584175-publicbeta-pixel2024</strong> of the Phone by Google app and found references to a toggle that would effectively disable the spoken Call Notes message. It's called <strong>Play audio tone instead of disclaimer</strong>, and the feature appears to work exactly like you'd expect based on its name.</p><p>Within the latest Phone by Google version APK, there are two new audio files that presumably relate to this feature. Android Authority surmises that they may be different tones for the beginning and ending of a recording session.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HV4oFxou98WazcAsXE34KC" name="google-pixel-9-call-notes-transcript.jpg" alt="Call Notes summary and transcript on the Google Pixel 9 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HV4oFxou98WazcAsXE34KC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A chime or tone would make it harder for the average person to discern whether their call is being recorded with Call Notes. Unless you're a Pixel user with access to the feature, it's unlikely that you'd know these new Call Notes sounds are really disclaimers that a conversation is being recorded.</p><p>Of course, there is a clear benefit to people recording who want to be subtle, as this feature could remove the awkwardness that the current level of transparency can create.</p><p>At the moment, it's unclear when, or if, this feature will arrive in the stable Phone by Google app. The fact that it is visible in the Phone by Google app beta signals that this is something Google is toying with, but it's not a confirmation that a change will certainly be made.

The user states they've noticed this updated design surface on their Galaxy Z Fold 6, as of Wednesday, June 4. This isn't on the stable version of Google Messages, as the publication states, but it seems more users with the app's beta version are noticing it.</p><p>The Reddit post offered a few screenshots, which showcase a slight change to the app's text field menus, specifically for emojis and the plus icon.</p><p>It seems Google is working on reworking its tabs for Photomoji, Emoji, GIFS, and Stickers. These options are housed in a pill-shaped container, instead of being listed beside each other without any barriers. When tapped, the selected option will take on a more colorful aesthetic, per your Material 3 Expressive choice. The publication calls this a "connected button group," which seems apt.</p><p>Regarding the plus icon, the user noticed the options there are seemingly a little larger in circular boxes and slightly more spread apart.</p><h2 id="google-s-moving-ahead-2">Google's moving ahead</h2><blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages/comments/1l3kfvd/material_3_expressive_on_galaxy_z_fold6">Material 3 Expressive on Galaxy Z Fold6</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages">r/GoogleMessages</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><p>On the other hand, where your texts are displayed, sees a slight change, as Google works in a solid-colored background. The chat bubbles seemingly remain the same; however, the texting field (the conversation) is now housed inside a rounded-corner container. As 9to5 notes, this creates a separation between your conversations and your standard calling, video calling, and menu buttons.</p><p>If you are in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.google.android.apps.messaging/join">Google Messages beta</a>, you may begin seeing this UI update as we close the week. One user with a Galaxy S25 Ultra has yet to see it, so the small update is likely still making its rounds.</p><p>It was during I/O 2025 when Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-unveils-the-most-massive-android-redesign-ever">unveiled its biggest Android redesign</a>: Material 3 Expressive. The company states this new design will focus on designs that feel good and make sense while helping you get more things done. M3 Expressive will lean heavily on colors and shapes to bring Android into this new generation of design. The entirety of the Android OS is expected to take on M3 Expressive, as well as several of Google's apps.</p><p>We've already seen some of these <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gmail/gmails-new-material-3-expressive-design-is-secretly-hitting-some-inboxes">new Expressive changes in other apps,</a> like Gmail.

Now Garmin has thrown its hat in the ring with a U.S. patent for tracking your glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels.</p><p>You can use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ppubs.uspto.gov/pubwebapp/static/pages/ppubsbasic.html">U.S. patent search</a> to find patent number "20250134464," which outlines how Garmin could use its watches' photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals — commonly used for heart rate and blood oxygen — to determine a "user's glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level."</p><p>As the patent explains, HbA1c checks the volume percentage of your blood's hemoglobin proteins that are "glycated," or bound or coated with glucose. Because glucose stays attached to red blood cells for their four-month lifespan, HbA1c "provides a long-term indication of the average blood glucose level...and is typically not impacted substantially by a single meal or activity."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2550px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="b4AGgPiVyDirFpJekzHyRR" name="Garmin-blood-glucose-patent-figure-4a" alt="A Garmin patent figure showing an "electronic fitness device" placing pressure on "human tissue," with various components calculating the level of pressure and sending it to the processor along with PPG data." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b4AGgPiVyDirFpJekzHyRR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2550" height="1434" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p>"Determining and monitoring HbA1c levels can help with the management of glucose and insulin," the patent continues, as diabetics want to maintain their blood levels below 7%. And lowering it below 5% "is believed to improve and maintain an individual's overall health."</p><p>Since, currently, people must draw blood to test levels, it's easy for people to be unaware of their growing HbA1c levels, or to avoid frequent testing because of the discomfort. That's why this "would be of great benefit to users of a wrist-worn device," to have this data available painlessly and continuously, the patent suggests.</p><p>This patented tool wouldn't replace the spot-check blood tests diabetics use on a daily basis. For that, Garmin partnered with Dexcom so you can continuously see your mg/dl of glucose from an attached Dexcom patch on your Garmin watch.</p><p>Instead, this seems more like a preventative tool that would warn prediabetics of bad glucose trends and encourage better fitness and nutritional habits to bring down your HbA1c gradually over weeks and months.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="QEBmLRKeY5w3sQJqFyXZQR" name="Garmin-blood-glucose-patent-figure-2b" alt="A Garmin patent figure showing the bottom sensors of a Garmin watch, with dotted lines pointing to a zoomed-in look at the sensors with various labeled components." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QEBmLRKeY5w3sQJqFyXZQR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What's the hold-up on seeing this feature in Garmin watches now? The patent warns that "conventional electronic fitness devices" will struggle to provide accurate data in this area. Pressure from a tight band can compress your blood vessels, and the size of your ligaments and bones will also skew the results.</p><p>So the watch's processor will need to determine a "pressure metric value" to compensate for these effects and provide accurate results. Garmin's patent outlines how it will attempt to pull this off, but it'll need FDA levels of accuracy before we'd ever see this HbA1c tracking feature in a consumer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a>.</p><p>Samsung execs have openly shared plans to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-exec-health-forum-glucose-monitoring-highlighted">put blood glucose tracking in a Galaxy Watch</a>, while Apple is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/31/apple-watch-glucose-monitoring-feature/">"many years away" from glucose tracking</a> despite several patents on the subject. We've even seen a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/circular-ring-2-heart-health-glucose-trends-annoucement">smart ring promise non-invasive blood glucose data soon</a>. It's no surprise, in other words, that Garmin would try to keep up with its rivals.</p><p>Interestingly, the patent also suggests its pulse spectrometry method could determine other chemical levels like SHb and MHb, signaling rare blood disorders where iron or sulfur binds with hemoglobin and interferes with your blood oxygen levels. And it would determine levels of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood, which could help catch other medical conditions.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="e2btkgXUAf9EJFtmPkPynX" name="Garmin-Fenix-8-bottom-sensors" alt="The bottom of the titanium Garmin Fenix 8, showing the charging port, QuickFit watch band connectors, and etched info about the watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e2btkgXUAf9EJFtmPkPynX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Many patents never see the light of day in consumer products.

But achieving faster browsing speeds also meant Google needed to rethink how the browser leverages a computer's CPU caches.</p><p>Moreover, Chrome's improvements saw a major shift in how it optimized memory layouts. Google's team also reduced the number of "non-relevant" items Chrome caches. The post adds that an update to Chrome's usage of Apple Advanced Typography technology (for font shaping performance) speeds up the browser wherever text is.</p><h2 id="chrome-s-getting-faster-2">Chrome's getting faster</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MoqaNuc7sYrwQGd2Usbkcj" name="Google-Chrome-Android.jpg" alt="Google Chrome logo on a phone screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MoqaNuc7sYrwQGd2Usbkcj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google Chrome has consistently worked on its browsing speed in recent history, and its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chrome-blows-the-competition-away-in-speedometer-3-tests">stunning Speedometer 3 tests</a> in 2024 were no exception. Since the benchmark debuted, Google said its browser improved by roughly 72%. What it highlighted last year was optimization for slower functions, which directly contributed to Chrome's overall speed increase.</p><p>Additionally, Google said Chrome was outfitted with better memory usage when drawing shapes while also cutting out "redundant" processes.</p><p>The latest test and the one from 2024 focused on computers, but that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chrome-doubled-its-speedometer-scores-on-android-with-the-help-of-snapdragon-8-elite">doesn't mean Android phones were left out</a>, especially those with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>. A new version of Chrome, specifically enhanced for higher-end Android devices, doubled its old score on the Speedometer 2.1 test. There's no single way users will notice Chrome's improvements on mobile devices, as Google says these upgrades will affect all facets of browsing. Opening large documents should be a lot smoother and quicker, just to name an aspect.</p><p>With Qualcomm's latest flagship chip, Chrome on Android scored 33.3, blowing its old 18.4 score out of the water.</p><p>Regarding its recent test, Google says it will continue to enhance Chrome's browsing capabilities, and more updates will be on the way.</p> ]]></dc:content>
