But Garmin keeps reporting record-setting profits on watches while bumping up prices across its entire lineup. Who's to say the Fenix 8 Pro won't find a credulous audience? It's still cheaper than a Rolex!</p><p>In 2025, Garmin fans have grumbled about higher watch costs, the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-connect-plus-in-depth-hands-on-much-more-than-an-ai-unfortunately">Garmin Connect Plus subscription</a>, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-watches-are-reportedly-crashing-displaying-a-blue-triangle">massive bootloop crash</a>, and especially when Garmin <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://garminrumors.com/has-garmin-abandoned-the-fenix-7-pro-after-just-1-5-years/">cut off new features for the year-old Fenix 7 Pro</a> to push the Fenix 8. "I'll never buy a Garmin watch again" has been a pretty common refrain on forums, and rivals like COROS and Polar would happily take their business.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6986px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="nVtGoqKtaHgc4d7bbtz6Mh" name="Garmin-Fenix-8-Pro-press-photo-3" alt="A photo of a man in the mountains wearing a Garmin Fenix 8 Pro, using it to check his nearby mapped location." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nVtGoqKtaHgc4d7bbtz6Mh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6986" height="3929" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The 4,500-nit Garmin Fenix 8 Pro MicroLED </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This hasn't stopped Garmin from climbing into the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prAP53613925">5th-best-selling wearable brand in 2025</a>, with a nearly 30% year-over-year growth, closing in on Samsung in 4th. Either the "never again" people weren't honest with themselves, or new customers happily took their place.</p><p>Garmin's recent earnings paint a clear picture.

Upgraded sensors, better hardware, and new health features are the norm. The onus is on them to convince <em>you</em> to keep paying the same price every year or two.</p><p>Garmin takes a very different approach. It usually takes 2–3 years to sell a new watch in each lineup, and it charges more for every new feature. So when the Forerunner 570 added a mic, speaker, and better health sensors, Garmin logic meant that it <em>couldn't</em> cost the same as the Forerunner 265 anymore.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/forerunner-570-and-970-have-made-garmin-tiered-strategy-clearer-than-ever">Garmin's price tier strategy</a> means certain tools, such as dual-band GPS or a mic & speaker, will never come to cheaper watches. For example, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-3-review">Instinct 3</a> was designed for hikers but didn't get topographic maps, making rival watches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-nomad-3-has-impressed-me-as-fun-garmin-instinct-3-rival">COROS NOMAD</a> look much better by comparison.</p><p>Likewise, Garmin's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-forerunner-970-running-tolerance-tool-too-useful-to-be-premium-feature">running tolerance tool</a>, which could help beginner runners understand their body's limits, is also locked off the cheaper Forerunners, upselling those beginners to a premium model they might not need.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Qm3c4DMYtUoCD2tjRSDZgQ" name="Garmin-Fenix-8-main-watch-face" alt="The default watch face on the Garmin Fenix 8 on the author's wrist.

Samsung watches are more expensive than ever, particularly the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic-review">Watch 8 Classic</a> and Watch Ultra. Polar bumped up its watch prices by hundreds of dollars to combat tariffs. And Apple arguably unleashed the floodgates for exorbitant smartwatches with the Apple Watch Ultra.</p><p>But with the Fenix 8 Pro launch, it's a good time to cover the fact that cheaper Garmin watches can still be great, even with Garmin restricting features from them.</p><p>I've previously written about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/three-beginner-garmin-watch-picks-as-garmin-expert">three best cheap Garmin watches for beginners</a>: the Vivoactive 6, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-165-review">Forerunner 165</a>, and Lily 2 Active. That advice still applies if you have a $300-and-under budget; most everyday athletes will get everything they need from one of these.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="PDXSzw9KFA8xDA2TAMqPuS" name="Garmin-Venu-3-muscle-map.jpeg" alt="A muscle map for side lunges on the Garmin Venu 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PDXSzw9KFA8xDA2TAMqPuS.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>But you can spend a little more than that without <em>overspending</em>. I'd say $500 is the cutoff: Most of our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">best Garmin watch</a> picks cost less than that, and you likely don't <em>need</em> to spend more than that, except for these specific scenarios:</p><ul><li>You're someone who goes on all-day hikes and can't make do with a smartphone map app, or backpack for days with limited access to power sources.</li><li>You regularly go skiing, diving, surfing, or other more specific sports that lower-end models don't track as well.</li><li>You want to leave your phone at home for workouts and use the Fenix 8 Pro's LTE calling and satellite messaging — at least until we get <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-should-make-more-pro-watches-like-fenix-8-pro-but-theres-a-challenge">more affordable Garmin LTE watches</a>.</li></ul><p>Outside of these scenarios, you can find everything you need under $500 with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review">Venu 3</a> (mic and speaker, 5th-gen sensors with ECG, a sleeker design); Instinct 3 (military-grade ruggedness, flashlight, longer battery life with a solar option); or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-265-review">Forerunner 265</a> (dual-band GPS, training load, run coach plans, daily workout recs).</p><p>Garmin makes these watches feel like compromise picks to upsell you, but everything else a premium watch would offer — titanium cases, voice commands, spare hours of GPS tracking — is probably something you can live without.</p><p>Of course, I love my extra-fancy, overkill Garmin watches and would be a hypocrite to say you <em>shouldn't</em> overspend on expensive maps, rich-people sports, and excess battery life. Grab yourself a premium Fenix 8 Pro or Forerunner 970 and enjoy.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Displays and side rails are almost universally flat across companies and product lines. Batteries are big. Ultrawide and telephoto cameras are all but standard. Even the corners of phones are nearly all rounded out. Some of these trends are great, others I could do without.</p><p>But, for far too many years, companies have used ugly, annoying protruding lenses that are too often aligned to the top-left of the phone. This not only makes the lenses prone to breaking if the phone is dropped, but it also makes the phone uneven. Everyone knows how much phones wobble when placed on a table, and it's annoying as heck.</p><p>However, the upcoming iPhone 17 and the Galaxy S26 both <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/samsung-galaxy-s26-edge" target="_blank">appear to be adopting</a> Google's superior camera bar design, one that not only centers the camera configuration but also creates a nice, even, horizontal camera island in place of raised lenses. I think it's better for any number of reasons, and it looks like it's finally becoming the standard.</p><h2 id="down-with-raised-lenses-2">Down with raised lenses</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DUcrUhphpMsCLyfbKF6m28" name="pixel-10-pro-vs-iphone-17-air-vs-iphone-17-pro-vs-samsung-galaxy-s26" alt="Leaked renders of the iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone 17 Air, and Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge alongside an official render of the Google Pixel 10 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DUcrUhphpMsCLyfbKF6m28.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Galaxy S26 render via Android Headlines, Pixel 10 render via Google, iPhone 17 render via Majin Buu (on X))</span></figcaption></figure><p>Above, you'll see leaked renders of the Apple iPhone 17 Air, Apple iPhone 17 Pro, Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge, and an official render of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review">Google Pixel 10 Pro</a>. There's no denying the similarities here.</p><p>Ever since the Pixel 6, Google has shown the world that a camera bar is the superior way <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-design-lead-discusses-large-camera-visor">to house all that clunky camera hardware</a> in an elegant fashion. After all, there's no way to keep a phone feeling thin and still deliver the camera quality people want without a big ol' camera lens sticking out of the back. Phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-magic-v5-review">Honor Magic V5</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> are probably the epitome of this concept.</p><p>However, many companies attempted to take the "simple" approach by placing the camera sensors behind large, protruding lenses on the backs of phones.

That's right, both Samsung and Apple seem to have misunderstood <em>the entire purpose</em> of the camera island.</p><p>Instead of flattening the backs and completely solving the problem of asymmetry and wobble, both of these companies have only reduced those issues. The lenses still protrude, and while there's little doubt that these all will wobble less than previous designs, this should have solved those issues.</p><p>Meanwhile, Google's excellent camera visor design is not only completely flat across the entire surface, but it has a really classy layer of metal trimming the outside and the right quarter of the design. This helps beef up durability over time and reduces the number of glass surfaces that could break in the event of a drop.</p><h2 id="google-is-setting-a-design-standard-2">Google is setting a design standard</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3671px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="p3oJVCUBw6s2H6oRXF7Mv9" name="Google-Pixel-10-review-21" alt="The Pixel 10 lying flat on a marble surface" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p3oJVCUBw6s2H6oRXF7Mv9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3671" height="2065" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'm really glad to see the camera visor making its way into a more standardized smartphone design format, even if Google still does it best.

With 2GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, you have the power and storage necessary for speedy Wear OS apps and music storage. And it has a rugged design rated MIL-STD-810-H for protection.</p><p>Considering most cheap Wear OS watches cost about $200, snagging a new model for a little over $100 is about as cheap as you'll find. <a class="view-deal button" href="" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="d210a6bc-2424-41a9-9bb4-e90ef736fece" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="TicWatch Pro 5: $349.99" data-dimension48="TicWatch Pro 5: $349.99" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You want a fast, rugged watch that prioritizes third-party apps; you hate having to charge your watch daily; and your first priority is saving money, followed by good Android integration.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You want the newest Wear OS software with Gemini; you care more about a small, comfortable design than battery life; or you don't really need watch apps.</p><p>The closest Wear OS equivalent to the TicWatch Pro 5 is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2r-review">OnePlus Watch 2R</a>, which has an identical 1.43-inch display, Snapdragon chipset, and a battery life average of three days.

Why is this watch so inexpensive?" The answer is that TicWatches have a downside compared to other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a>: They don't support Gemini or Google Assistant. For whatever reason, Mobvoi hasn't managed to get the signature app working on its watches.</p><p>You also have to accept that it still runs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-4">Wear OS 4</a>, though it will hopefully jump to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> soon. For comparison, newer Android watches will launch with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a>, supporting all the latest app upgrades and UI improvements.</p><p>We wouldn't recommend getting the TicWatch Pro 5 at full price ($349) when you could buy a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Pixel Watch 4</a> for the same price. But at $109? You'll never see a new Google or Samsung watch at that price; you'd have to compare the TicWatch Pro 5 against budget brands like Amazfit that can't compete with Wear OS for software, even if it's an older version.</p> ]]></dc:content>

However, what I didn't expect to like as much as I did is Google's flavor of Android 16. It's vibrant, responsive, and it brings some welcome changes that I've been hoping to see on Pixel software.</p><p>That said, the Pixel UI has never been my favorite, and while I like the changes Google has made with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-review">Android 16</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-unveils-the-most-massive-android-redesign-ever">Material 3 Expressive</a>, there are still some things I would like to see Google implement in future versions of Android. In fact, many of these features feel so commonplace on other Android phones, I'm surprised Google hasn't implemented them on Pixels.</p><h2 id="quick-settings-2">Quick Settings</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4183px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5JqS9eaPkcEVDuG9xkxBEf" name="Google-Pixel-10-review-03" alt="Quick Settings on the Pixel 10" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5JqS9eaPkcEVDuG9xkxBEf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4183" height="2353" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Perhaps my favorite change to Pixel UI is with the Quick settings. I wasn't a huge fan of the unnecessarily large tiles in previous versions, which limited the number of tiles you could view at a time compared to One UI. But now, Google lets you customize the Quick Settings panel more than I thought it would ever allow.</p><p>You can now resize any tile simply by long-pressing it. You only get two choices, which are essentially 1x1 or 2x1, but it allows you to fit more tiles onto the panel and provide it with more personality, letting you highlight the most important tiles if you so choose.</p><p>That said, there still are some annoying quirks that haven't been addressed with Android 16.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4223px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="qcHg4kMeTR7PrPTyagWRHU" name="Google-Pixel-10-Android-16-4" alt="Pixel 10 and Galaxy S25 Plus Quick Settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qcHg4kMeTR7PrPTyagWRHU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4223" height="2375" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For a feature called "Quick Settings," I feel like it's not that great at actually offering quick access to some essential settings. For some reason, it takes two swipes of the panel in order to access the brightness slider, which is annoying when I want to quickly adjust it beyond the auto brightness.</p><p>Additionally, the actual Settings button is also inaccessible until the second swipe. Sure, I could have an icon on the home screen or swipe through the app drawer, but I prefer not to clutter my home screen with apps/widgets. I may just be spoiled by Samsung's Quick Settings, which gives you immediate access to the Settings icon after one swipe down.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4062px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Du9jhjyCvwST9AkPYJwEsC" name="Moto-G-Power-2025-review-08" alt="Holding the Moto G Power 2025 and showing the quick settings panel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Du9jhjyCvwST9AkPYJwEsC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4062" height="2285" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Finally, I would love to see Google add an option to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/how-change-back-to-single-notification-quick-settings-panel-one-ui-7">separate the notification panel and Quick Settings menu</a>. I've gotten used to this on Samsung and Motorola phones, and I have started to prefer it since it shows more tiles or notifications at once, and I can easily swipe between the two panels.</p><h2 id="multitasking-2">Multitasking</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4031px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="57BGqnNs7pVgcpNNruax5U" name="Google-Pixel-10-Android-16-5" alt="Pixel 10 next to the Galaxy S25 Plus with the multitasking view open" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/57BGqnNs7pVgcpNNruax5U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4031" height="2267" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While Google is focused on improving the multitasking experience on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldables</a> like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-hands-on">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a>, the experience on its traditional phones feels a bit lacking.</p><p>The Open Apps view simply displays large cards side by side, which doesn't offer a particularly helpful view of your apps. This isn't a huge deal, but it doesn't feel as useful as the Open Apps view from other OEMs. Furthermore, while access to features like Screenshot and the text selector are useful, I would like the option to see recommended apps to quickly jump into one.</p><p>Also, it doesn't make sense to me that I have to swipe all the way to the right in order to find the Clear All button. Even Motorola allows me to open the view and tap Clear All without swiping. I can also lock an app to the Open Apps view so that it stays open when I clear the rest, which is helpful when I'm streaming YouTube Music, for example.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DjteYa4P7bQ2GESnwDyqGU" name="Google-Pixel-10-Android-16-6" alt="Pixel 10 next to the Razr Ultra 2025 with an open side panel of apps" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DjteYa4P7bQ2GESnwDyqGU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One feature I've been begging to see on Pixels is a native side panel. This is a space to quickly access your favorite or most-used apps simply by swiping from the side of the display on nearly any screen. It's incredibly useful, and usually the first thing I set up when using a new phone. It's also available on just about every other smartphone I've tested, from Samsung to TECNO, so it's odd that Google <em>still </em>hasn't included an option for it, despite giving us a taskbar on foldables.</p><h2 id="more-customization-2">More customization</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="EanvkdzoHDSkmWMHY55N2V" name="Google-Pixel-10-Android-16-7" alt="Pixel 10 and Galaxy S25 Plus Quick Settings editor" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EanvkdzoHDSkmWMHY55N2V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> come with some level of customization, and the Pixel UI has improved on this front, especially with the aforementioned Quick Settings. That said, while there is a decent amount of customization, I would like to see more.</p><p>The Open Apps view is just one example; Google should let us <em>choose</em> the style in which apps are presented. Same with the Quick Settings menu; we should be able to further rearrange, resize, and change the style of the tiles and panel. Samsung does a great job of letting you rearrange the different elements on Quick Settings, and that would be a great starting point.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3008px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QwefJKDp6nLVP78xzBqyrS" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-stacked-widget" alt="A stacked widget on the Galaxy S25 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QwefJKDp6nLVP78xzBqyrS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3008" height="1692" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>But even more than that, Google should let us customize other aspects of the Pixel UI, such as the shape of app icons and content shown on the status bar, allowing us to choose which icons we want presented and how. OnePlus offers this on its phones, and I always appreciated this as a way to declutter the top of my screen.</p><p>And as someone who prefers a cleaner home screen, I would also love to be able to stack widgets.</p><h2 id="best-of-both-worlds-2">Best of both worlds?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FTYuydExpAGrAN85qrg6TU" name="Google-Pixel-10-Android-16-1" alt="Pixel 10 next to the Galaxy S25 Plus with Google Lock open" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FTYuydExpAGrAN85qrg6TU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are plenty of smaller things, too, which could add up to some pretty granular customization options. However, Android has always been about providing its users with options, and while many like the Pixel UI for what it is, offering the option for deeper customization could go a long way.</p><p>Maybe Google could launch a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-good-lock">Good Lock</a>-style app (perhaps called "Pixelate"), which gives users more ways to customize their phones without Google needing to mess with the core Pixel experience.

While they may be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/BrendanEich/status/1963012916875231354" target="_blank">complaining on social media</a>, CEOs of companies like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/brave-browser-secretly-installing-vpn">Brave</a> know that nobody will continue to support the code base that makes their product possible the way Google has been doing.</p><h2 id="who-are-the-losers-2">Who are the losers?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3774px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8wNc88sFgWN2ay2k6stBCo" name="Microsoft-logo.jpg" alt="The Microsoft logo at MWC 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8wNc88sFgWN2ay2k6stBCo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3774" height="2123" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When someone "wins," it means someone has to lose as well. I see two outright losers from this decision: Microsoft and Internet publishers.</p><p>Microsoft doesn't need Google to continue to support and maintain Chromium, even though its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/have-you-tried-microsofts-new-edge-browser">Edge browser</a> uses the engine. It's entirely capable of doing it and would have been happy to do so if it meant its web browser market share could grow as Chrome collapsed. Having Google still doing most everything it has been doing means Microsoft will need to spend more money to compete.</p><p>Lastly, internet publishers will now see Google, whose AI is already affecting business models, sharing some of the data it collects with competitors. That means even more AI companies will be able to sidestep actual web articles in favor of an AI-generated response, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/googles-ai-overviews-in-search-might-kill-publishing-and-its-going-to-backfire-eventually">reducing web traffic and revenue</a> for the companies producing the content. Many had hoped for some sort of "opt-out" of AI web indexing without being penalized in proper search results, but that was not part of the ruling.</p><h2 id="so-what-about-us-2">So what about us?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.91%;"><img id="PbCAker93FMnB5iSzuEETV" name="google-io-2021-keynote-3-billion-android-devices.jpg" alt="Google I/O 2021 Keynote 3 Billion Android Devices" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PbCAker93FMnB5iSzuEETV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1145" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While it's interesting to see how this court ruling will affect the finances of tech companies, what's most important to me (and many of you) is what it means for us, the over 3 billion Google customers who use the company's products and services.</p><p>The news is decidedly neutral. The suit may have been brought to protect users like you and me, but the result doesn't really do much there.

The latest leak comes from Android Headlines via prominent tipster On Leaks, which got their hands on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/samsung-galaxy-s26-edge">official-looking CAD renders</a> of the Galaxy S26 Edge, giving us a closer look at the device.</p><p>Right off the bat, the renders showcase the device from all angles and seem to have a flatter display, with a front camera at the top. You can also spot thinner bezels on the device, with the power button on the right side, with the volume controls right above it.  The frame of the phone is also slightly more sqaured off as well.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">OK #FutureSquad...

Instead, in 2025, we're seeing the Ear 3 finally come around. While the Nothing Ear can handle rumbling bass and sub-bass, with other such audio refinements, it remains to be seen how the Ear 3 takes things further.</p> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Screen protectors are Android phone accessories that feel almost mandatory to keep your gadgets safe against cracks and scratches. However, as a review that tests many phones and even more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/best-google-pixel-10-pro-xl-screen-protectors">screen protectors</a>, I find them to be wildly inconvenient. They're difficult to apply, it can be hard to find them in stock at stores near you when you need them, and can need replacing often. There might be a better way, and I tried it at the Zagg booth at IFA 2025.</p><p>Zagg's On-Demand InvisibleShield machine is sort of like a kiosk for custom screen protectors. Name just about any device model and pick a film screen protector variant, like matte or privacy, and order it like you would a coffee. There is information for thousands of devices stored in the Zagg On Demand machine, with the precise measurements for each.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5Q8uiieSNBNe5dkPCjKdcX" name="Zagg-Screen-Protector-4" alt="Zagg's On Demand screen protector machine cutting film for a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5Q8uiieSNBNe5dkPCjKdcX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This wide-ranging support for phone and device models is extremely useful for niche models, or new and old ones. For instance, if you want to get a screen protector in your home country for a phone that isn't generally available there — think using an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-magic-v5-review">Honor Magic V5</a> in the U.S. — you're probably out of luck at a big box retailer. However, a shop with an On Demand machine can cut a film for your uncommon device or ten-year-old phone in minutes.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="asmLgKoSAAVMGgWsvnmKdX" name="Zagg-Screen-Protector-5" alt="Zagg's On Demand screen protector machine cutting film for a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/asmLgKoSAAVMGgWsvnmKdX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>After you name your device, you'll need to pick a film screen protector type. A notable limitation of the On Demand machine is that it can't cut tempered glass screen protectors, only TPU film. A Zagg representative told me that's why there aren't as many Zagg On Demand service providers in the U.S. as there are in Europe; the American market prefers tempered glass over film.</p><p>Personally, I find matte film screen protectors to be the perfect mix of feature set and protection. The matte finish helps diffuse sunlight for better visibility, and the film protects your screen from scratches without being another thing for you to crack.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FNjqYSPxh57u6dMb2UHqbX" name="Zagg-Screen-Protector-3" alt="Zagg's On Demand screen protector machine cutting film for a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FNjqYSPxh57u6dMb2UHqbX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You can choose from Zagg's InvisibleShield Defense, Elite, or Extreme film screen protector types depending on the feel you're looking for. From there, you can choose either Ultra Eco (biodegradable), Ultra Matte (anti-glare), Elite VisionGuard (blue-light blocking), or Privacy Matte versions. After that, an operator will put your chosen film into the machine, it'll precision-cut it, and soon it'll be ready to be applied.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="e2a65tXi7USicXJFGPrpYX" name="Zagg-Screen-Protector-1" alt="Zagg's On Demand screen protector machine cutting film for a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e2a65tXi7USicXJFGPrpYX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In just a few minutes, you'll end up with something like I did in the photo above — a phone with a cut-to-order screen protector. I was fascinated by the process, and find there to be a few major advantages to this kind of service. For one, you're getting an expert to install your screen protector. If you don't like how it turns out, you can address that right then and there without having to go through a return or warranty process.</p><p>There's also the fact that this process allows stores to provide screen protectors for far more devices than they ever could with pre-packaged kits. It's an approach that uses less waste as well. Even large retailers like Best Buy struggle to keep a variety of screen protectors in stock for same-day pickup, but with Zagg On Demand, it's nearly instant.</p><p>Zagg has been using On Demand machines for over five years now, and I hope they catch on more. It's cool to watch, and has too many practical benefits for both businesses and customers to ignore.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Lau confirmed that OnePlus is in the process of developing its new DetailMax Engine to deliver "clarity and authenticity" for users and their captured photos. Lau states that, to create the DetailMax Engine, he was involved in interviews with a wide range of users about what they want most out of such software.</p><p>Users informed OnePlus that they want "clear and real" photos, and pictures that remain crisp and detailed even when pinching to zoom.</p><p>Lau says the company's DetailMax Engine computational imaging software has evolved to a point where it can "capture and interpret vastly more data, delivering images with unmatched depth and realism." The company states its new in-house engine will never mask photos with "over-beautification or distortion," once again highlighting the true-to-life, in a way, appeal of a user's photography.</p><p>Lau informs users that testing for the early prototype is underway, and that he's been involved in it so far. The company says the engine should be ready by launch, meaning all the wrinkles and things should be ironed out. Lau thanks Hasselblad for guiding OnePlus toward this imaging future it's racing toward and states it's excited for new opportunities, whatever those may be.</p><h2 id="the-end-of-an-era-2">The End of an Era</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ZD9tpSMioRfEMgypYQLecH" name="OnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13 next to OnePlus 13R" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZD9tpSMioRfEMgypYQLecH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We've had to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/more-rumors-oneplus-15-in-house-camera-system-reported">settle with rumors</a> about OnePlus' supposed departure from Hasselblad thus far, and the most recent ones shed more (alleged) light on it.

The first of which was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/ayn-thor-pre-orders-open-tonight-and-its-much-cheaper-than-i-thought">AYN Thor</a>, a dual-screen clamshell handheld, is still available to pre-order via Indiegogo.</p><p>The second is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/ayn-announces-dual-screen-thor-and-next-gen-odin-3-handhelds">AYN Odin 3</a>, arriving as the long-awaited successor to the ever-popular Odin 2. However, instead of just dropping both the Thor and Odin 3 at the same time, AYN opted to let the hype build for the Thor first, and now it's time for the Odin 3.</p><p>More than anything else, the most exciting aspect of the Odin 3 is the chip at the helm. It's powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite, the same SoC found in many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> released over the past year. This marks the first handheld to be announced with the 8 Elite, although we suspect <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/ayaneos-konkr-pocket-fit-elite-could-set-the-bar-for-android-gaming-handhelds">AYANEO's KONKR Pocket FIT</a> will soon follow.</p><h2 id="ayn-odin-3-specs-2">AYN Odin 3 Specs</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mUf13ignOxk" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol empty" ></th><th  ><p>AYN Odin 3</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6-inch AMOLED, 1920 x 1080, 120Hz</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>8GB/12GB/16GB/24GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>128GB (UFS 3.1) / 256GB/512GB/1TB (UFS 4.0) + microSD</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>8,000mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6.0</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Extras</p></td><td  ><p>Active Cooling, DisplayPort Alt Mode, 3.5mm Audio Jack</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>Android 15</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Beyond that, the AYN Odin 3 looks not all that dissimilar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://amazon.com/dp/B0DT4G4PD2">Retroid Pocket 5</a>, albeit with a larger screen and more comfortable ergonomics. Some of the other specs include a 6-inch AMOLED display, with a 120Hz refresh rate, along with a massive 8,000mAh battery.</p><p>AYN is offering a total of four different configurations, starting with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of UFS 3.1 expandable storage for the base model. At the top-end, you'll get the Snapdragon 8 Elite paired with 24GB of RAM and 1TB of UFS 4.0 expandable storage.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1516px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="neQaKPi4BnfNrZkRF35TN" name="ayn-odin-3-product-render-colors-1" alt="Render of AYN Odin 3 in Black" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/neQaKPi4BnfNrZkRF35TN.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1516" height="852" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYN)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1512px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="LcsNSMiTbgKyZwMNb8PCP" name="ayn-odin-3-product-render-colors-3" alt="Render of AYN Odin 3 in Gray" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LcsNSMiTbgKyZwMNb8PCP.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1512" height="850" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYN)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2506px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="GaDyRRZZ3tRv76RZe8AAR" name="ayn-odin-3-product-render-black-1" alt="AYN Odin 3 First Released Product Render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GaDyRRZZ3tRv76RZe8AAR.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2506" height="1409" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYN)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2017px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="YzXUALTKrwaxp6qhsin5d" name="ayn-odin-3-product-render-colors-5" alt="Render of AYN Odin 3 in Clear Blue" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YzXUALTKrwaxp6qhsin5d.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2017" height="1134" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYN)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1995px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="tsCCgSLwmJDYdjWYTXHBd" name="ayn-odin-3-product-render-colors-4" alt="Render of AYN Odin 3 in Clear Purple" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tsCCgSLwmJDYdjWYTXHBd.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1995" height="1123" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYN)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Part of what makes the Odin 3 so exciting isn't just the fact that we're getting a dedicated handheld with the Snapdragon 8 Elite. It's that pricing starts at just $299, and even if you max out the RAM and storage, it's only $499.</p><p>The only device released this year that gets even close to that is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/redmagic-astra-oled-gaming-tablet-ive-always-wanted">RedMagic Astra</a> tablet at $549. But that's just for the base model with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. If you wanted to match configs between the Astra and Odin 3, the former would set you back $899, $400 more than AYN's handheld.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iuKk9HYGFUJxzWkHBqjUn" name="ayn-odin-3-product-lifestyle-4" alt="AYN Odin 3 product lifestyle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iuKk9HYGFUJxzWkHBqjUn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYN)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's absolutely wild to see AYN not only release a new flagship handheld, but doing so at an extremely affordable price. Considering that Lenovo just announced the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/handheld-gaming-pc/lenovo-legion-go-2-specs-officially-revealed">Legion Go 2</a> with a starting price of $1,049, it might be time to consider an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">Android handheld</a> and learn the wonders of Winlator.</p><p>If you're like me and can't wait to get your hands on the Odin 3, you're kind of in luck. When announcing the price, AYN confirmed that pre-orders will begin on September 7 at 9:30 PM ET over at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/odin-3-the-ultimate-6-120hz-oled-gaming-handheld/coming_soon">Indiegogo</a>. The only downside to this is that we'll be waiting a little while, as the IGG landing page says that these aren't expected to begin shipping until November.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="bd1b30c5-033b-4448-ae36-a2f054257014">            <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/odin-3-the-ultimate-6-120hz-oled-gaming-handheld/coming_soon" data-model-name="AYN Odin 3" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FoBLWSVAoVvRPbeqax6eVC.jpg' alt="AYN Odin 3 (Black) square render "></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">AYN Odin 3</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>A new flagship Android handheld</strong></em></p><p>It's been almost two years since the Odin 2 was released.

This doesn't fix anything that you might think is "wrong" with the S25 Edge, except now the price isn't stupidly crazy expensive. That could be enough reason to make it your next new phone.</p><p>Let's dive in.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-pros"><span>The Pros</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9LsA2guYNRTpYU3bdU4tci" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-colors-24" alt="Holding the Galaxy S25 Edge in all three colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9LsA2guYNRTpYU3bdU4tci.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung makes a lot of different phones at just about every "level" of quality. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review">The S25 Edge</a> is clearly designed to be on the premium side of it all.</p><p><strong>It's fast</strong>. Samsung will take the magic inside a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-2">Qualcomm Snapdragon chip</a> and sprinkle some extra secret stuff on it, and make incredibly responsive phones. Inside, the S25 Edge has mostly the same parts as its thicker brother, the "regular" S25, and that means it will be nice and snappy to use.</p><p><strong>The display is awesome</strong>. Samsung makes some of the best displays, both phone-sized and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/stunning-8k-tv-samsung-has-zero-bezels">big old TV-sized</a>, that you can buy. That's why many other companies buy them from the Korean tech giant. The S25 Edge has a beautiful display, and that's the part of the phone you pay the most attention to.</p><p><strong>It's thin and light</strong>. Titanium is not a great material for anything that will run hot, like a phone, but its other properties - namely, its sturdiness and light weight- make it desirable. The S25 Edge is a really thin phone that only weighs about 160 grams. It's <em><strong>the </strong></em>highlight of the product and where it takes its name.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-cons"><span>The cons</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5X3g5jjGrSrgzYF9ifFnTi" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-jet-black-hands-on-3" alt="The Galaxy S25 Edge camera sensors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5X3g5jjGrSrgzYF9ifFnTi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Three things instantly come to mind here, and no price reduction will "fix" them.</p><p><strong>The camera</strong>. I won't try and tell you the camera system on the Galaxy S25 Edge sucks, because it doesn't. In fact, I'll wager it's better than a lot of other phones you can buy today. But it's not as good as the cheaper "regular" model and nowhere near as good as what you'll find on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a>, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16</a>. That was a much bigger problem when the price was the same or higher than any of those phones, but it's still <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/i-took-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-to-a-concert-to-see-if-telephoto-lenses-are-overrated">lacking when it comes to getting up close and personal</a>.</p><p><strong>The battery</strong>. A thin phone means a thin battery, and even Samsung hasn't been able to change physics to allow otherwise. The battery life on the S25 Edge can be decent, but it can also be a disaster depending on how much you use it throughout the day and what you're trying to do with it. It shouldn't be a surprise to anyone, smaller batteries equal less time between charges.</p><p><strong>The thinness and heat</strong>. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-soc-for-galaxy-s25-series">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> inside the S25 Edge gets hot as Hades. It is supposed to get that hot; there's nothing wrong with it. The issue is that with a phone so thin, moving that heat away fast enough can become an issue. Samsung did everything right, but without the sheer mass and being made with titanium, the phone will need to throttle down the speed more often than others. If you live in the Yukon, this might not be an issue. If you live in Arizona, well ...</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-my-verdict"><span>My verdict</span></h3><p>This Amazon deal fixes the biggest, most glaring issue with the Galaxy S25 Edge: its price tag. But it doesn't change anything else.</p><p>If you really want a super thin phone, for whatever reason, well, this is the phone you should be buying. Do it now, while it's on sale, so you won't have to spend way too much money on it.</p><p>If you need a great camera with a superb telephoto lens system, this phone is not for you, and no price reduction can change that. Most everything else is in place, but digital zoom is so 2010.</p><p>If you like to constantly check your phone or play games for hours on end, you're not going to love the battery life. No mincing words here, it's made smaller and can't provide as much juice as other S25 models.</p><p>For a lot of people, this will be an awesome phone to have. It would probably work great for me, in fact.

The publication states that Samsung has reached out to its suppliers with new numbers for September. This month, the company reportedly plans to produce 260,000 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> units, a notable 60,000-unit increase from its original plan.</p><p>It appears that the popularity of the latest book-style foldable has forced Samsung to produce more. Additionally, the post claims that Samsung's Fold 7 production in 2025 could "exceed" its "annual expectations."</p><p>However, the post says that Samsung had to increase its Fold 7 production in August, too, by roughly 100,000 units. It adds that "early adopters" (pre-orders) are a major catalyst behind the Fold 7's extreme production boost on Samsung's side. This is something that was reported before, especially following the company's summer Unpacked event.</p><h2 id="the-popular-one-2">The popular one</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="eywqvFaRMzpU9poUfE3Cr3" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on-32" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 hinges hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eywqvFaRMzpU9poUfE3Cr3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Regarding the publication's "early adopters" note, in July, reports rushed in about the Galaxy Z Fold 7's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-finally-pulls-ahead-of-the-flip-in-sales-in-korea">stunning performance</a> in South Korea. It was reported that, for the first time ever, the Fold 7's pre-orders were more popular than the Flip 7. The larger foldable pulled 60% of the pre-orders following Unpacked, which is a stark turnaround from the Flip 6's 70% dominance in 2024.</p><p>It seems that the changes and upgrades made to the Fold 7 have pushed people to reconsider their foldable of choice. Of course, the Fold 7 has received a thinner build, and it's also much lighter than it previously was.</p><p>That's not all, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-says-galaxy-z-fold-7-screen-decade-long-durability-report">Samsung also paraded its Fold 7 around</a>, detailing everything new and improved that consumers can expect. One of the major highlights is that, through its screen tests, the Fold 7 is expected to survive roughly 500,000 folds. In layman's terms, Samsung states this should last the "average user" around 10 years. The phone's UTG (ultra thin glass) was also improved, meaning the phone's crease throughout these thousands of folds should remain minimal.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="73694d2c-660e-477a-938e-e8606f4f7225">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n492cdTmAtXoxYWXC3iyrB.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 7 is its thinnest-ever book-style foldable.

Things are just as impressive under the hood, as the 'Fan Edition' Samsung phone also boasts an upgraded Exynos chipset, 8GB of RAM, and One UI 8 straight out of the box. </p><p>The phone also comes with a triple array camera system, much like the rest of the S25 lineup, with an upgraded 12MP front-facing camera that's perfect for taking selfies. Furthermore, the Galaxy S25 FE comes with a large 4,900mAh battery (that's a bigger battery than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-hands-on">Galaxy S25 Edge</a>), all of the latest AI software tools, and seven years of OS and security upgrades guaranteed. </p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AbkdzoFSTR7FC8KowH7oYF" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-FE-4" alt="The Samsung Galaxy S25 FE in hands-on photos." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AbkdzoFSTR7FC8KowH7oYF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Sure, the Galaxy S25 FE isn't a dramatic transformation over its predecessor, and it certainly isn't going to win any awards for revolutionizing performance, but it's a well-priced smartphone that's simply good at being a smartphone. That being said, it isn't that much cheaper than the standard Galaxy S25 or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-review">Google Pixel 10</a>, so if you can find a good deal on those flagships, I'd probably skip the Galaxy S25 FE altogether.</p><p>That being said, if you're a fan of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phones</a> and you want to try one of the best 'Fan Edition' phones released in years, then the S25 FE is a great buy, <em>especially </em>with a deal like this attached.  </p><p>It's not uncommon to see <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-verizon-phone-deals-plans">Verizon deals</a> advertise free phones, but it's always nice to see an offer that has so few strings attached. All three of the eligible data plans come with unlimited talk, text, and data on Verizon's vast 5G network, plus you'll receive access to a ton of useful international and entertainment perks. The Big Three carrier is even offering free $200 gift cards with select online purchases, so be sure to look into that when you buy to see if you're eligible. </p> ]]></dc:content>

The company just took it up a notch by introducing Voice Translate for phone calls in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-review">Pixel 10</a> series.</p><p>This new feature in the phone app allows the AI voice model to translate what you're saying into another language, in real-time and in the sound of your speaking voice. If you live in the U.S. and you've <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/first-things-to-do-with-the-google-pixel-10">just bought the Pixel 10</a>, here's how you can take advantage of Voice Translate on your next phone call.</p><h2 id="how-to-set-up-and-use-voice-translate-during-calls-on-the-pixel-10-2">How to set up and use Voice Translate during calls on the Pixel 10</h2><p>1. Open the <strong>Phone</strong> app, tap the <strong>hamburger</strong> menu and tap <strong>Settings</strong>.</p><p>2. Next, tap <strong>Voice translate</strong> and enable the toggle switch.</p><p>3. On the same page, choose the <strong>Language you speak</strong> and you can download additional languages if needed. Give it some time for the new language pack to finish downloading before trying it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:74.81%;"><img id="D8xHDQ8AXCZ5gb5reTqx4m" name="pixel-10-voice-translate-phone-calls-1" alt="Pixel Voice Translate in phone calls on Pixel 10" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/D8xHDQ8AXCZ5gb5reTqx4m.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3240" height="2424" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>4. Once Voice translate is set up and enabled, make a call and tap <strong>Call Assist</strong>. Next, choose <strong>Voice translate</strong>.</p><p>5. You'll then get an option to select the speaking language of the caller.</p><p>6. Both parties will hear a brief automated message that says the call is translated by Google AI in each speaker's voice and that the audio is not saved.</p><p>7. After this, you simply continue the conversation normally, and the AI will translate your voice to the caller's language, but using your tone and speaking style. The same goes for the other party, and you'll hear their voice translated into your language.</p><p>8. The entire call will be transcribed on your Pixel 10 as the conversation goes on.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:74.81%;"><img id="4QxCrNWBmAbn8XKQqoZCo4" name="pixel-10-voice-translate-phone-calls-2" alt="Google Pixel voice translate during calls on Pixel 10" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4QxCrNWBmAbn8XKQqoZCo4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3240" height="2424" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Note</strong>: Voice Translate works even if the person you're calling doesn't have a Pixel 10. Both voices will still be translated to sound like each person. It works fairly well in our experience, and even though the translation is not always perfect, it doesn't really detract from the conversation.</p><h2 id="speak-your-mind-with-the-pixel-10-s-awesome-new-feature-2">Speak your mind with the Pixel 10's awesome new feature</h2><p>This live Voice Translate feature during phone calls is quite game-changing and helps break down the language barrier even further. It only works on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/which-google-pixel-10-model-should-you-buy">Pixel 10 series</a> and later, which means Google can now do this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">on-device</a> and in near-real time thanks to the advancements made to the Tensor G5 chip. Currently, Voice Translate supports translation between English and the following languages:</p><ul><li>French</li><li>German</li><li>Hindi</li><li>Indonesian</li><li>Italian</li><li>Japanese</li><li>Portuguese</li><li>Russian</li><li>Spanish</li><li>Swedish</li></ul><p>Just like the new Pixel Journal app, privacy is taken very seriously. Google explicitly states on its support page that no conversation audio or transcription is stored on the device. Conversations are never sent to Google, and neither are they retrievable after the call. The feature works even without an internet connection, further ensuring privacy. Voice Translate can be easily deactivated at any time, or you can turn it off for particular calls.</p><p>The Google Pixel 10 is one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android smartphones</a> you can buy today, and features like Voice Translate really help separate it from the competition.

What started as a nifty note-to-audio feature is now becoming a full-blown conversation machine that’s sharper, snappier, and far more expressive.</p><p>Instead of being stuck with the same old back-and-forth, you now get four flavors to choose from: <em>Deep Dive</em> for detailed analysis, <em>Brief </em>for quick rundowns, <em>Critique </em>for feedback-driven takes, and <em>Debate </em>for when you want two AI hosts to square off over your notes.</p><p>Perhaps the real star of the show is the debate mode because this is where it gets interesting. When you give NotebookLM a proposal or research draft, it can spin it into a podcast-style clip. Instead of a flat summary, you’ll hear multiple AI voices laying out a structured debate around your work.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">🚨Rolling out NEW audio overview formats: (Default) Deep Dive: a thorough examination of your sourcesBrief: 1-2 minute, bite-sized overviewsCritique: an expert review, offering constructive feedback on your materialDebate: a thoughtful debate between two hosts pic.twitter.com/m3z3yASMyF<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1962949985546187120">September 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><h2 id="you-control-the-conversation-2">You control the conversation</h2><p>You can also adjust the tone and runtime of these AI podcasts, meaning you can choose between a fast one-minute overview or a deeper, extended analysis.</p><p>The updates don’t stop there.

There are a few exceptions, but none that would be able to match up with Samsung's flagship tablet lineup.</p><p>Since the first Ultra Galaxy Tab was released with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-tab-s8">Tab S8 series</a>, I've considered the line to be the absolute best that money can buy. And it appears, at least from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-fe-galaxy-tab-s11-ultra-hands-on">Brady's initial impressions</a>, that will continue with the Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra once it's released.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CbbTUYWHZABsAXJqhxp5mW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-S11-2" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 and S11 Ultra." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CbbTUYWHZABsAXJqhxp5mW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's just something about the almost 15-inch display that draws me in, combined with the premium design, S Pen, and expandable storage. The Tab S11 Ultra checks all of those boxes yet again, managing to get even slimmer than before, while retaining most of the same features as before, save for the move back to a single selfie camera.</p><p>Now, a question pops into my head that I haven't been able to really answer: what can Samsung possibly do next? There are some outside-the-box ideas that come to mind, such as turning it into a foldable device, similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/laptops/lenovos-new-16-inch-thinkpad-x1-fold-is-the-most-flexible-versatile-windows-pc-ever" target="_blank">Lenovo's ThinkPad X1 Fold</a>, that runs Android.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2070px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="xFE9fssxFzGsst56Rnk9fb" name="lenovo-thinkpad-x1-fold-wc" alt="Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Fold with Keyboard attached and propped on desk" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xFE9fssxFzGsst56Rnk9fb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2070" height="1164" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Windows Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Perhaps that's the most logical next move, because I don't really think Samsung, or any other company, can do anything else that would be considered "ground-breaking." At least not with keeping the "traditional" slab of glass or aluminum. I mean, the Tab S11 Ultra is just 5.1mm thin, which is 0.3mm thinner than last year's model, and now matches up with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-ipad-pro-m4-13-inch-long-term-review">13-inch M4 iPad Pro</a>.</p><p>It's a weird thought to have, realizing that at least when it comes to the absolute best of the best, the ceiling has likely been reached. Provided that Samsung keeps the Ultra line around, I suspect we're in store for a bunch of minimal design changes (if any), paired with a spec bump and whatever potential changes to Android may be in store.</p><h2 id="where-else-can-samsung-improve-2">Where else can Samsung improve?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="aAHo8NoVaxPv2aexFa3biW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-S11-1" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 and S11 Ultra." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aAHo8NoVaxPv2aexFa3biW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>So if this is "it" for the design, what's next?</p><p>I'm glad you asked! For one, I'd absolutely love to see Samsung stop gate-keeping RAM options for the 1TB model. With the Tab S11 Ultra, you have 12GB of RAM and either 256GB or 512GB of storage. The only way to get 16GB of RAM is to spring for 1TB of storage, and vice versa, and it's just maddening.</p><p>I understand profit margins and all that jazz, but come on now. Stick to one RAM config and make everyone happy. Maybe it wouldn't bother me as much if this were a one-off, but it's not. Samsung does the same thing with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>, as the only way to get the most RAM is to also get the highest storage capacity.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7ppWkqUoV2Q78Crm72jAPX" name="Galaxy-Tab-S10-Plus-2" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Tab S10+ on a desk." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7ppWkqUoV2Q78Crm72jAPX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Last year's Tab S10+ is the only cellular flagship Samsung tablet </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Besides that little frustration, the only other hardware change I'd like to see is for there to be a cellular option here in the States. As it's been done in years prior, the only way to get the Tab S Ultra with cellular connectivity is to import a model released in another country. Samsung isn't even offering a cellular Galaxy Tab S11 model, and instead is leaving the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/hey-samsung-wheres-the-galaxy-tab-s10">Tab S10 Plus</a> to serve as the connected option, which is an odd choice.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="ZVbmhGeJG2Sn5cbtNMydWo" name="ipad-pro-2021-129-adm-2.jpg" alt="iPad Pro 12.9 (2021) with iPhone on table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZVbmhGeJG2Sn5cbtNMydWo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There is one more thing that I'd love, and I mean LOVE, to see Samsung do, and it doesn't even need to wait until the Tab S12 to do it: steal the iPad Pro keyboard design. If I'm working at a desk or table at the coffee shop, there's really nothing wrong with the Smart Cover Keyboard.</p><p>But the instant that I want to sit on the couch and use the tablet as a laptop with the keyboard, it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s8-ultra-book-cover-keyboard-dont-buy">turns into a balancing act</a>. I like the idea of the removable back cover that doubles as a stand, but the actual keyboard portion is just not great. It's flimsy to the point that I accidentally click the trackpad if I push down too hard on one side or the other.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="afJDKZtkLTawmas8tyDAZR" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review-14" alt="iPad Pro M4 next to Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra with keyboard cases" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/afJDKZtkLTawmas8tyDAZR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>None of those are problems with the iPad Pro keyboard, and it's frustrating that Samsung hasn't even really tried changing things up with the design. And no, adding a dedicated AI key doesn't count, nor does offering the Book Cover Keyboard Slim, as it lacks a trackpad.</p><p>I mean, Samsung charges as much as some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebooks</a>, <em>just</em> for the Book Cover Keyboard ($350). Is it too much to ask for a keyboard case that lets me turn a laptop-sized tablet into an Android laptop?</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Patn8Z3Ft6FSe8Jbzke8pW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-S11-5" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 and S11 Ultra." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Patn8Z3Ft6FSe8Jbzke8pW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Not to mention that there isn't even a new Book Cover Keyboard launching with the Tab S11 Ultra, with only the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile-accessories/book-cover-keyboard-slim-galaxy-tab-s11-ultra-sku-ef-dx930ubeguj">Slim version</a> being announced.

Meta Hypernova is a next-generation pair of smart glasses rumored to be announced on September 17, 2025, at Meta Connect 2025.</p><p>Meta Hypernova has been leaked and rumored for months and appears to be a middle ground between the full-fledged computer on your face, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Meta Orion</a>, and current Meta AI-powered smart glasses like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oakley-meta-hstn-smart-glasses-review">Oakley Meta HSTN</a>. If I'm going to make any comparison, it's likely these are akin to a smartwatch on your face, as far as capabilities go.</p><p>They're also slated to ship <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-semg-wristband-whitepaper">with a gesture band</a> to make daily interaction a breeze. We've seen tons of leaks and info appear ahead of the official unveiling and have collected everything in one place below for your convenience. Here's everything you need to know about Meta Hypernova!</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-meta-hypernova-price-and-availability"><span>Meta Hypernova: Price and availability</span></h2><p>Meta Hypernova is expected to be announced at Meta Connect on September 17, 2025. The new smart glasses are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-reportedly-low-sales-expectations-project-hypernova-smart-glasses-report">rumored to retail for $799</a> and are expected to be packaged with an sEMG gesture bracelet. The final retail product name is thought to be "Meta Celeste."</p><p>The glasses are slated to be available sometime later this fall, according to leaks, with Meta reportedly estimating that they will sell around 150,000 units in the first two years due to the price.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-meta-hypernova-design-and-features"><span>Meta Hypernova: Design and features</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1654px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="tVkmiZjCv4R7taoaFErcYG" name="meta-hypernova-leaked-render" alt="A leaked render of Meta Hypernova or Meta Celeste smart glasses and the sEMG wristband" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tVkmiZjCv4R7taoaFErcYG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1654" height="930" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Luna (@Lunayian) on X)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Leaked renders of Meta Hypernova, seen above, have a similar overall design to Ray-Ban Wayfarer glasses. The biggest difference between them is the thickness of the frames, as Hypernova has to fit a display in one of the lenses in addition to extra compute circuitry and a larger battery than Ray-Ban Meta or Oakley Meta smart glasses.</p><p>A key differentiator between those smart glasses products and Hypernova is the inclusion of a single display in one of the lenses. It's not yet known if this is customizable, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-with-display-rumor">but early reports</a> said the display will be in the bottom portion of the right lens. It's likely that Meta is using waveguide optics for Hypernova, as the company was seen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-lets-engineers-talk-openly-about-ar-glasses-hardware-and-challenges">openly bragging about this tech recently</a>.</p><p>The small display in one lens would act similarly to the display on a smartwatch. Since it's small, Meta would need to keep things terse and deliver glanceable information. This will likely range from smartphone notifications to turn-by-turn directions. Leaks also note that a small app launcher can display six icons on screen, similar to the mockup we made in the image below.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jriGiXXyBox8gzXnTUD28B" name="meta-ray-ban-smart-glasses-hypernova-mockup" alt="A mockup of what Meta Hypernova smart glasses could look like using transparent Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jriGiXXyBox8gzXnTUD28B.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A mockup of what Meta Hypernova smart glasses could look like using transparent Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Meta Hypernova is likely using a similar version of the Android operating system that we used on Meta Orion last year. This OS resembles a lightweight version of the Meta Horizon Android-based OS, which powers VR headsets like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Meta Quest 3</a>. We expect Hypernova's OS to be even more pared down, though, and is unlikely to feature traditional windows or full-fledged apps like Orion runs.</p><p>Rumors suggest that the glasses will ship with a handful of dedicated apps, with the potential for Meta to add more apps down the road. Meta AI, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, a camera app, and a maps app are all thought to be pre-installed on each pair of Meta Hypernova smart glasses.</p><p>Unlike Meta Orion, Hypernova isn't supposed to have positional tracking. This means the glasses won't be able to overlay virtual objects onto the real world the way a Meta Quest headset currently can. We expect later versions of Meta glasses to be able to do this, though.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="AMDmQ7j9FheNMVoBMDTpCg" name="meta-ai-logo-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-in-front-01" alt="A Meta AI logo on a laptop with a pair of Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses in front" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AMDmQ7j9FheNMVoBMDTpCg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A next-generation version of onboard Meta AI is expected to launch with Meta Hypernova glasses.

That's on par with what competing brands charge. Now I want Garmin to start bringing this Pro upgrade to a much wider range of watches, but I don't know if it'll be able to pull it off.</p><p>I understand Garmin choosing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-pro-announced-with-lte-satellite-and-microled-key-highlights">Fenix 8 Pro</a> as its launch point. Loyal users get first dibs on InReach cellular calls, satellite messaging, and emergency SOS, without losing the premium Fenix perks they already enjoy. And the Fenix 8's fantastic battery life ensures it can handle the extra battery burn from LTE connectivity.</p><p>The problem, of course, is that the Fenix 8 Pro costs $1,200 or more. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a> fans expect inflated prices, but this stretches the budget most people want to spend. As great as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Fenix 8</a> is, not everyone will want a thick, titanium model when they can get a lighter Forerunner, longer-lived Enduro, or stylish Venu.</p><p>I want Garmin to launch "Pro" versions of its most popular models. It already sells several "Music" variants, which add Wi-Fi and music storage (but nothing else) for $50. A $100 "Pro" upgrade with LTE and satellite could follow that same template, spreading better safety tools across the lineup.</p><p>My concern, though, is that LTE and satellite may end up being another cool Garmin feature restricted to the most premium price tiers and biggest watches.</p><h2 id="why-i-want-more-garmin-x-pro-watches-2">Why I want more 'Garmin X Pro' watches</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8021px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="azJo4AseRLvWQhWcm8MiSh" name="Garmin-Fenix-8-Pro-press-photo-2" alt="A photo of a man in the mountains wearing a Garmin Fenix 8 Pro, using it to call someone using LTE cellular data." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/azJo4AseRLvWQhWcm8MiSh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8021" height="4512" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Garmin Fenix 8 Pro gives you cellular and satellite support for $100 more than the standard Fenix 8. With LTE, you can call and message contacts via the Garmin Messenger app or share your real-time GPS location over LTE via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.garmin.com/en-US/?faq=HbqxxbiBGA3mDhlLX4GUw8">LiveTrack</a> so loved ones have your last-known location in an emergency.</p><p>For satellite messaging, you'll need to find an unobstructed spot to connect with a Skylo satellite for at least 30 seconds, after which the Pro will send your text messages (or SOS) and receive any queued messages.</p><p>Garmin's solution isn't perfect, since friends and family will have to download Garmin Messenger, or else receive your messages from a random Garmin number. But since half of its customers use iPhones, Garmin would have always needed a workaround. It's certainly better than the alternative (nothing)!</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3864px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="qZVgQdpWAmNgoMfQ4oadPb" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-4-Satellite-communications-4" alt="Pixel Watch 4 searching for a satellite connection" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qZVgQdpWAmNgoMfQ4oadPb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3864" height="2174" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What matters is that any Garmin watch will, by default, last for days (if not weeks) longer than an Apple, Galaxy, or Pixel Watch with LTE capabilities. None of these has a LiveTrack equivalent, and only the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/google-pixel-watch-4-hands-on">Pixel Watch 4</a> has satellite SOS via the same Skylo network.</p><p>Serious outdoorsy types who frequently hike in dead zones would much rather rely on a watch that can last for weeks instead of hours for emergencies. You need GPS longevity and peace of mind more than you need apps or Gemini/ Siri smarts on the trail.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-venu-4-wishlist">upcoming Venu 4</a> seems best suited to compete with mainstream watches because of its stylish design, and it would appeal to women who want to run late or hike in isolated areas, but have safety concerns.

And everyone who bought the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/garmin-forerunner-945-lte-review">Forerunner 945 LTE</a> for cellular safety tools would want a modern Forerunner Pro with more fleshed-out features.</p><h2 id="why-we-may-not-see-many-garmin-lte-watches-2">Why we may not see many Garmin LTE watches</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8192px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="okKMT5B8g8bfLdHtTzrvBh" name="Garmin-Fenix-8-Pro-press-photo-4" alt="A photo of a person kayaking while wearing a Garmin Fenix 8 Pro, using it to call someone using LTE cellular data." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/okKMT5B8g8bfLdHtTzrvBh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8192" height="4608" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Garmin sells dozens of watches, so which ones need a cellular 'Pro' upgrade? It'll probably start with premium models like the Tactix 8 for soldiers or Quatix 8 for sailors, for whom staying connected is vital. But I'd want the more accessible Forerunners, Instincts, and Venus to follow.</p><p>Here's the problem: look how physically <em>chunky</em> the Fenix 8 Pro is. Both the 47mm and 51mm Pro models are about 2mm thicker than their Fenix 8 counterparts. At 16mm and 16.5mm, they're blockier than nearly every<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness"> fitness watch</a> out there.</p><p>Garmin told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2025/09/garmin-fenix-8-pro-lte-microled-satellite-messaging-hands-on-everything-you-need-to-know.html">DC Rainmaker</a> that "due to hardware limitations with integrating the LTE antenna," it couldn't make a 43mm Fenix 8 Pro size work. Engineering challenges meant it "wasn't possible" to make the cellular and satellite antennas small enough. They weren't "avoiding" making smaller, LTE-enabled watches as a long-term strategy, but it may not be feasible in the short term.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="e5ZNbibquFyQLLZHdiG8qe" name="garmin-fenix-8-product-photo.jpeg" alt="Photo of the Garmin Fenix 8 on an athlete's wrist, showing a daily suggested workout." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e5ZNbibquFyQLLZHdiG8qe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6000" height="3375" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The too-small Fenix 8 43mm </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The 13.8mm-thick Fenix 8 with a 1.3-inch display isn't what I'd call a <em>small</em> watch! So I'm skeptical that this first-gen antenna could fit inside any Venu model, whether it's the 12mm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review">Venu 3</a> or 8mm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-venu-x1-review">Venu X1</a>. That is, until Garmin's engineers can make one that's smaller but still offers strong connectivity.</p><p>Hopefully, watches like the Instinct 3 or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-forerunner-570-review">Forerunner 570</a> could fit a full-sized antenna inside. Even with the $100 LTE surcharge added, they'd cost half as much as the Fenix 8 Pro, with enough battery life for more casual athletes going on day hikes or nightly runs.</p><p>But maybe that's the problem. Garmin tends to price-lock certain features like offline maps to its most expensive models. Could Garmin decide to only add LTE and satellite to premium models like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-970-review">Forerunner 970</a>?</p><p>I'm hoping Garmin strays from tradition here. It can sell off its $1,200 Fenix 8 Pro stock to superusers, but then it should bring this LTE/ satellite tech to a wider range of models — even if it's only the big ones to start. I'm sure there'll be a big audience for it.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="f49d2555-ae02-41df-9ac0-ef7b5808e653">            <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/garmin-fenix-8-pro-amoled-sapphire-gps-smartwatch-47mm-fiber-reinforced-polymer-titanium-at-t-2025/JXF9YFFS9G" data-model-name="Garmin Fenix 8 Pro AMOLED" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Mmd3NzuKnBtUGNKgxc397n.jpg' alt="Render of the Garmin Fenix 8 Pro AMOLED Sapphire GPS Smartwatch 47mm Titanium"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Garmin Fenix 8 Pro</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Hopefully starting a trend</strong></em></p><p>The Garmin Fenix 8 Pro adds LTE-M and Skylo satellite support to its flagship watch.

First announced with the earbuds, now the headphones will see those improved algorithms as well.</li><li>The second-generation Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones will be available for $449.</li><li>The headphones will see a new Cinema Mode and two new colorways.</li></ul><p>Bose has been on a tear in the summer of 2025, announcing an update to their QuietComfort Ultra earbuds and SoundLink Micro portable speaker. In addition, it's released a new portable speaker, the SoundLink Plus, which we found to be one of the best in its price point <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bose-soundlink-plus-review" target="_blank">in our full review</a>. And now we have the second-gen Bose QuietComfort Ultra to look forward to.</p><p>Announced today (Sept. 5) for preorder and available on October 2, 2025, for $449, the second-generation QuietComforts see a $20 jump from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bose-qc-ultra-headphones-review" target="_blank">2023's launch</a>, likely due to the inclusion of USB-C audio. They'll be available in Black, White Smoke, and in two new limited-edition colors, Midnight Violet and Driftwood Sand, with what Bose is calling "a new premium design with polished metal materials and colorways."</p><p>In a press release, Bose states that the most impactful upgrade to the new headphones is their improved on-head detection, which will automatically start up when connected to paired devices after being placed on your head. They'll go into a low-power standby mode that Bose says will last for months when you take them off and lay them flat or place them back into their carrying case.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6dRjEDZaKMAjKnDmoJv5EH" name="bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones-2nd-gen-midnight-violet-169" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones in Midnight Violet over an other worldly background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6dRjEDZaKMAjKnDmoJv5EH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Bose)</span></figcaption></figure><p>However, given the ANC battle for supremacy between Bose and Sony, it may be that the most impactful update is the improved AI-powered ActiveSense adaptive noise-cancelling algorithms, which could place Bose as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-noise-canceling-headphones" target="_blank">market leader in active noise-cancelling</a>.</p><p>Among the new updates and features, Bose claims to have improved battery life by six hours, now reaching 30 hours with ANC on, and 23 hours with Immersive Audio activated. That's up from 24 and 18 hours, respectively, on the first-generation headphones. When the QuietComfort Ultra (2nd Gen) are drained, 15 minutes of quick charge will get you three hours of playback.</p><p>Like much of the competition, Bose has added USB-C audio support this year, which accommodates 16-bit, 44.1kHz, or 48kHz lossless audio files. And while we're talking about more robust audio options, the new Cinema Mode purportedly gives you a wider sound stage while giving greater clarity to dialogue.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1532px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="VQ8zXNzpsVWaUGUHdGhNi8" name="Bose-QuietComfort-Ultra-Headphones-2nd-Gen-Midnight-Violet-stange-planet" alt="A woman wearing the Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones (2nd Gen)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VQ8zXNzpsVWaUGUHdGhNi8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1532" height="861" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Bose)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's going to be a lot to talk about once both the earbuds and headphones are available, and of course, we'll have reviews for you, so that you can decide if the Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones or earbuds will be among your next audio purchases.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="bd1b30c5-033b-4448-ae36-a2f054257014">            <a href="https://www.bose.com/home" data-model-name="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones (2nd Gen)" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p9RPxB6c9VTvnftm6mzj7R.jpg' alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones (2nd Gen) showing in Midnight Violet"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones (2nd Gen)</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Updates and new features for 2025</strong></em></p><p>Upgrades to ANC and battery life, along with the new addition of USB-C support for lossless audio, could make these a very compelling pair of noise-canceling headphones among some strong competition.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

According to Woodward, nano banana, the Gemini app's imaging editing model, is the catalyst behind the 10 million-plus users who've started using its AI services.

The built-in editor, "nano banana," lets the AI use a user's prompt for better image generation/editing. In short, users can blend photos, mix up designs, and more. For blending, users can tell Gemini to combine two separate photos into one, as if they were always like that.</p><p>Users can even let their imagination shine for selfies. With your prompt, Gemini can turn you into a space-walking astronaut, a rock star, or anything else you can think of. Mixing up designs is sort of like a continuous editing session with Gemini. Users can tell Gemini what to add to an empty room (for example) and continue to tweak its design. It's sort of like follow-up questions, but you're simply expanding and adding onto your ideas with the AI.</p> ]]></dc:content>

A Weather app has already been available on Pixel Watches since Wear OS 3 in 2022, but Google is now launching Pixel Weather on Pixel Watch models starting with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Pixel Watch 4</a>.</p><p>One of the major features here is that the Pixel Weather app on Pixel Watch brings the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-unveils-the-most-massive-android-redesign-ever">Material 3 Expressive design</a> to the app, even though the layout is similar to what's currently available on Wear OS. The app icon matches the phone version with the classic yellow sun on a blue background.</p><h2 id="pixel-weather-isn-t-just-for-phones-anymore-2">Pixel Weather isn't just for phones anymore</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DxbkxK7ruQxz3zgZJ4xwHm" name="pixel-weather-app-1" alt="Pixel Weather app on Pixel Watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DxbkxK7ruQxz3zgZJ4xwHm.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="h4FqEynfwhevcTesSig4Dm" name="pixel-weather-app-2" alt="Pixel Weather app on Pixel Watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h4FqEynfwhevcTesSig4Dm.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>In typical Material 3 Expressive fashion, the city view shows a large pill-shaped card with the current temperature, condition with an icon, and highs and lows in the card. Above the card, you see the city name and the current time. The background also reflects the weather, just like on the phone app.</p><p>Alongside the app, Google has also updated the watch face tiles for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-pixel-weather-app-just-got-a-handy-update-for-unit-measurements">Pixel Weather</a>. There are now three tiles available: one with temperature, high/low, and precipitation chance; one with sunrise/sunset times; and one with UV index. In all tiles, the time and city appear above the weather info. The publication also notes that watch face complications are coming.</p><p>There's no confirmed release date yet for the Pixel Weather app on Pixel Watch, but it is expected to arrive with the Pixel Watch 4 next month. Although Google has already started putting screenshots of Pixel Weather on the Play Store for Wear OS. It's also unclear what will happen to the old Weather app once Pixel Weather rolls out.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Its been rumored for a while that Samsung is looking to drop its base model in favor of the following lineup: Galaxy S26 Pro, Galaxy S26 Edge, and the Galaxy S26 Ultra. It <em>seems </em>like these models are lined up in the tipster's photo in that order, meaning the S26 Edge is in for a major change.</p><p>The tipster alleges the device could see a raised, horizontal camera bar with two camera lenses. As the X post points out, the design is oddly similar to what's been theorized for Apple's upcoming iPhone 17 series.</p><p>The other two devices may continue the design cues we've seen from the Galaxy S25 series. However, as 9to5 states, Samsung might plan for a better Qi2 experience with this new flagship series. There's no getting around the fact that the S25 series <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-support-qi2-wireless-charging">needs a case with the magnets</a> for its "Qi2 support" to work. All three leaked prototypes have a small indentation, which leaves the publication to wonder if this is a sign of more proper Qi2 support.</p><p>The tipster concludes things by alleging Samsung could launch the S26 series "in February."</p><h2 id="what-s-next-for-s26-2">What's next for S26?</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here’s your first look at the Samsung Galaxy S26 dummies, Launching in February, and it looks like Samsung is going with a design very similar to the iPhone 17. pic.twitter.com/z581xHUxph<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1963563003993076135">September 4, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>As previously stated, Samsung's been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-might-switch-things-up-with-its-galaxy-s26-lineup">rumored to shake up its next Galaxy S lineup</a>, something we heard about in July. It was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/leak-shapes-the-galaxy-s26-pro-possible-small-screen-s25-successor">alleged in August</a> that the Galaxy S26 Pro could wind up being the successor to the smaller screen base model, like the S25. Early rumors claim the S26 Pro could rock a 6.2-inch display with a 4,300mAh battery.</p><p>The next Edge, on the other hand, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/rumor-galaxy-s26-edge-s26-pro-battery-specifications-alleged-increases">was rumored</a> to see a larger 4,200mAh battery, up from its current 3,900mAh capacity. Nothing was purported about any design changes, unlike what we're seeing today with the alleged dummy units. Another leak says the S26 Edge could be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-leak-your-next-supercharged-phone-elite-2-rumored">your next superpowered phone</a>, as it's expected to rock the Snapdragon 8 Elite 2 (or 8 Elite Gen 5, whatever its name ends up being).</p><p>The device supposedly appeared in a performance test with Qualcomm's next flagship SoC, with a single-core score of 3,393 and 11,515 in its multi-core stage.</p> ]]></dc:content>

That's when this feature comes into play.

The brand launched three new midrange phones: the Motorola Edge 60 Neo, Moto G06, and Moto G06 Power. The former <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-edge-60-fusion-announced">rounds out the Motorola Edge 60 lineup</a>, while the latter two devices offer large displays and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-power-2025-review">long battery life on a budget</a>.</p><p>The phones are coming to Europe and global markets, but Motorola couldn't say whether they would make their way to the U.S. If prior launches are any indication, we probably won't see the Motorola Edge 60 Neo, Moto G06, or Moto G06 Power launch in North America, at least by those names.</p><p>I went hands-on with the Motorola Edge 60 Neo, Moto G06, and Moto G06 Power, and here's what you need to know about them.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Lenovo, which owns Motorola, provided travel and lodging for Innovation World 2025, but did not have any input in this article.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7dB7RQrybphFGmw8XFUVUh" name="Motorola-Edge-60-Neo-1" alt="The Motorola Edge 60 Neo in the hand and on display at IFA 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7dB7RQrybphFGmw8XFUVUh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Motorola Edge 60 Neo comes a year after the Edge 50 Neo, and retains a similar design and core specs to its predecessor. The big change is a chip upgrade, as the Edge 60 Neo is now powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 7400 chipset. However, it's unclear whether performance will be materially improved compared to the Dimensity 7300 platform that powered the Edge 60 Neo.</p><p>The chip enables <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a>, Gemini, and Circle to Search features, as well as AI-focused camera optimizations.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9kHDcR99U35qpL9UneUUSh" name="Motorola-Edge-60-Neo-5" alt="The Motorola Edge 60 Neo in the hand and on display at IFA 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9kHDcR99U35qpL9UneUUSh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The display is still impressive for the price point. It's the same 6.4-inch pOLED display panel from last year's Edge 50 Neo. The screen still supports 3,000 nits of peak brightness and HDR10+ support — both of which are excellent for interested Edge 60 Neo buyers, as these are excellent for a phone that's this affordable.</p><p>Motorola improved the durability of the Edge 60 Neo this year, adding IP69 dust and water-resistance, which takes IP68 to the next level. IP69 adds protection against high-pressure and high-temperature water tests, meaning in theory, your Edge 60 Neo could survive a dishwasher run (don't do that). It's kind of a gimmick, but more durability is always welcomed. On that front, the display covering is now Gorilla Glass 7i, up from Gorilla Glass 3 on the Edge 50 Neo.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LCDeWLEcyTQrPVFx9nyHfh" name="Motorola-Edge-60-Neo-8" alt="The Motorola Edge 60 Neo in the hand and on display at IFA 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LCDeWLEcyTQrPVFx9nyHfh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Rounding out the list of upgrades is larger battery. The Motorola Edge 60 Neo has a 5,000mAh battery with the same great 68W wired fast charging support. There's also 15W wireless charging support.</p><p>There are no camera upgrades on this year's Motorola Edge 60 Neo — on the back is a triple-camera system with a 50MP main sensor, 13MP ultrawide, and 10MP telephoto lens. For your selfies, there's a 32MP camera lens.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="g9Ut62izFrCyEbz6rmSTYA" name="Motorola-Moto-G06" alt="The Motorola Moto G06 and G06 Power in the hand and on display at IFA 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/g9Ut62izFrCyEbz6rmSTYA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Meanwhile, the new Moto G06 and Moto G06 Power come less than a year after the Moto G05 series debuted. Motorola is calling the display on these phones the biggest it's ever shipped on a Moto G smartphone, as it now measures 6.88 inches in size. The display on both phones supports 600 nits of peak brightness, and it's paired with stereo Dolby Atmos speakers for audio.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Sa2LP3JmZJ83CvMmkqtS7A" name="Motorola-Moto-G06-5" alt="The Motorola Moto G06 and G06 Power in the hand and on display at IFA 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Sa2LP3JmZJ83CvMmkqtS7A.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The big separation between the Moto G06 and Moto G06 Power is, you guessed it, battery life. The regular Moto G06 has a respectable 5,200mAh battery capacity, but the Moto G06 Power elevates that further with a 7,000mAh capacity. Unfortunately, the Moto G06 Power only charges at 18W with a cable; luckily, you probably won't have to charge it very often.</p><p>We're still waiting to learn other key specs and availability details for the Motorola Edge 60 Neo, Moto G06, and Moto G06 Power, and we'll update this article when more information is available.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The company continues that trend with the Lenovo Yoga Tab, a mid-range tablet, and the Lenovo Idea Tab Plus, a budget productivity tablet. Both arrive this month following their official reveal at Lenovo Innovation World 2025.</p><p>I went hands-on with the Yoga Tab and Idea Tab Plus, and they're Android 15 tablets with specific users in mind. The Lenovo Yoga Tab is creator-focused, down to the high-resolution display and preloaded Adobe Creative Suite software. Meanwhile, the Idea Tab Plus is a no-frills option for people who want a decent Android tablet on a tight budget.</p><p>Here's what you need to know about them, and who should buy each one.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Lenovo provided travel and lodging for Innovation World 2025, but did not have any input in this article.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-specs"><span>Specs</span></h2><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Lenovo Yoga Tab</p></th><th  ><p>Lenovo Idea Tab Plus</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>11.1-inch, 3.2K (3200 x 2000 resolution), 16:10 LTPS, 144Hz, 98% DCI-P3, 800 nits, 340ppi</p></td><td  ><p>12.1-inch, 2.5K (2560 x 1600 resolution, 16:10 LCD, 90Hz, 96% DCI-P3, 800 nits, 249 ppi</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</p></td><td  ><p>MediaTek Dimensity 6400</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Memory</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 12GB</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 12GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 256GB</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 256GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Operating system</p></td><td  ><p>Android 15</p></td><td  ><p>Android 15</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>8,860mAh</p></td><td  ><p>10,200mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Front camera</p></td><td  ><p>13MP, FF, f/2.2, 101-degree field-of-view</p></td><td  ><p>8MP, FF</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear camera</p></td><td  ><p>13MP, AF, f/2.2 main camera and 2MP, FF macro lens</p></td><td  ><p>13MP, AF</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Audio</p></td><td  ><p>4x speakers (2x tweeter and 2x woofer) with Dolby Atmos; 2x microphones</p></td><td  ><p>4x speakers with Dolby Atmos; 2x microphones</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 5, Bluetooth 5.2</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>10.06 x 6.53 x 0.24-0.33 in.</p></td><td  ><p>10.98 x 7.13 x 0.26 in.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>458g</p></td><td  ><p>530g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Luna Grey, Seashell</p></td><td  ><p>Luna Gray, Cloud Grey, Sand Rose</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-lenovo-yoga-tab"><span>Lenovo Yoga Tab</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kP8g7hZARG7YTmVNn9tgg5" name="Lenovo-Yoga-Tab-4" alt="The Lenovo Yoga Tab connected to a keyboard folio at IFA 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kP8g7hZARG7YTmVNn9tgg5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Oftentimes, when you think of a "creator" tablet, the word <em>expensive</em> also comes to mind, with tablets like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-fe-galaxy-tab-s11-ultra-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra</a> costing anywhere between $1,000 and $2,000. However, the Lenovo Yoga Tab aims to meet creators at the $550 price point, undercutting both premium and cheaper options, such as the base Galaxy Tab S11 and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-3-review">OnePlus Pad 3</a>.</p><p>The highlight of the experience is the display. I think the 11.1-inch panel is the perfect size for a basic tablet. The screen uses LTPS LCD technology, and while it's not OLED, it'll look better and feel more responsive than the old LCDs you may be used to. The resolution stands out at 3.2K, helping the Yoga Tab double down on its creative focus.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ntGBTmnvvMceazrRGie8e5" name="Lenovo-Yoga-Tab-2" alt="The Lenovo Yoga Tab connected to a keyboard folio at IFA 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ntGBTmnvvMceazrRGie8e5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The resolution makes the Yoga Tab ideal for drawing, photo editing, or video editing, and it looks great in person. It'll even be able to handle color-accurate work, as Lenovo says it covers 98% of the DCI-P3 color gamut. It's not often you see a tablet validated for color accuracy, especially at this price point. The 144Hz refresh rate will be beneficial for basic responsiveness and light gaming.</p><p>I had no issues with the quality of the Lenovo Yoga Tab screen, but the brightness capabilities stuck out to me as a potential concern. The tablet can only hit 800 nits of maximum brightness, which is half that of the Galaxy Tab S11 series. Granted, the Yoga Tab is cheaper, although some creatives might find they need that extra brightness, especially when outdoors.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="UMxD5xt93ueCRmr9m8gPY5" name="Lenovo-Yoga-Tab-5" alt="The Lenovo Yoga Tab connected to a keyboard folio at IFA 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UMxD5xt93ueCRmr9m8gPY5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Under the hood is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> processor paired with up to 12GB of RAM and up to 256GB of storage. Originally, I wished Lenovo equipped the Yoga Tab with the better <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> chip, but the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 actually makes sense for this price point.</p><p>Lenovo touts 20 TOPs of NPU power, but many of the tablet's AI features rely on cloud processing anyway. Lenovo's suite of AI features includes those we've come to expect from mobile devices in 2025, like generative text editing and sketch-to-image generation.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JcqWJE8w6m5KSLMTPsxj85" name="Lenovo-Yoga-Tab-1" alt="The Lenovo Yoga Tab connected to a keyboard folio at IFA 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JcqWJE8w6m5KSLMTPsxj85.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The tablet comes with Adobe Creative Suite pre-installed, plus a free trial, which is a nice touch. However, being that Adobe products are heavily reliant on subscriptions, it doesn't add much extra value to your Yoga Tab purchase. You get a two-month free trial of Adobe Lightroom and Adobe Express, plus a three-month free trial of Perplexity Pro.</p><p>All told, I came away from my brief hands-on with the Yoga Tab pretty impressed — it's a thin, premium-feeling tablet with a few tweaks specifically designed with creators in mind.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-lenovo-idea-tab-plus"><span>Lenovo Idea Tab Plus</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="gucY8J75vpvxiiF7QEtn5h" name="Lenovo-Idea-Tab-Plus-3" alt="The Lenovo Idea Tab Plus at IFA 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gucY8J75vpvxiiF7QEtn5h.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Idea Tab Plus is a slightly larger but cheaper <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> tablet. This 12.1-inch tablet starts at just $270, which is much lower than many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">best Android tablets</a>. At this price point, you're looking at a basic device and expect a few compromises, which is why Lenovo is positioning the Idea Tab Plus toward basic productivity and content consumption.</p><p>Notably, it has the same great in-hand feel as the Yoga Tab, with an aluminum chassis and a thickness of only 6.29mm at its thinnest point. The bigger display is a basic LCD panel with a 2.5K resolution — lower than the Yoga Tab but still more than suitable for everyday use. The refresh rate tops out at 90Hz, and the brightness can only reach 800 nits peak.</p><p>For what it's worth, even the budget Idea Tab Plus manages to grab 96% of the DCI-P3 color space, which is pretty impressive.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ufRrHbftHkmuCNejsuuy7h" name="Lenovo-Idea-Tab-Plus-7" alt="The Lenovo Idea Tab Plus at IFA 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ufRrHbftHkmuCNejsuuy7h.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You might not be able to do photo editing or video editing on the Idea Tab Plus due to hardware limitations, but the display itself is pretty good for color-accurate work. The processor is the 6nm MediaTek Dimensity 6400, which resides firmly in mid-range territory. I didn't notice any lag or general slowness while playing around with the Idea Tab Plus.</p><p>However, it's unlikely to win many benchmarks or crush demanding tasks, even with up to 12GB of RAM onboard.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="a88i7urYDTrQSaF9Bezuhf" name="Lenovo-Idea-Tab-Plus-2" alt="The Lenovo Idea Tab Plus at IFA 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a88i7urYDTrQSaF9Bezuhf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While there are a handful of cost-cutting measures taken to make the Idea Tab Plus more affordable, there are also a few neat perks that come with this tablet. There's a dual microSD and SIM card slot for the 5G model, so you get cellular connectivity <em>and</em> expandable storage. There are more color options, too: Luna Grey, Cloud Grey, and Sand Rose.</p><p>A few things remain consistent across the Yoga Tab and Idea Tab Plus, like quadruple Dolby Atmos speakers and dual microphones.

The increased cover panel gives it much better versatility, and while Samsung still doesn't allow the use of apps, it's easy to get around that limitation.</p><p>Interestingly, Samsung used its in-house Exynos 2500 chipset on all global models of the Galaxy Z Flip 7, deviating from Qualcomm silicon. While recent Exynos designs have been panned (for good reason), Samsung LSI seems to have learned from its mistakes.</p><p>The Flip 7 still isn't in the same league as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a>, Galaxy S25, and other regular phones, but it is quite decent in the context of foldables. The inherent nature of the Flip 7 doesn't allow the inclusion of a sizeable thermal management layer, and as a consequence, it doesn't hold up anywhere as well in demanding use cases.</p><p>However, this is the case with all foldables, and the Flip 7 has a decent showing against the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x-fold-5-review">Vivo X Fold 5</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">Find N5</a>, even if it doesn't quite measure up in some areas.</p><h2 id="more-cpu-cores-than-you-ll-know-what-to-do-with-2">More CPU cores than you'll know what to do with</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Lv9zZPspiFNQmLc54eR3NP" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-7-Review-9" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Lv9zZPspiFNQmLc54eR3NP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Exynos 2500 is built on Samsung Semiconductor's 3nm Gate All Around (GAA) node, which is interesting in its own right as TSMC is still reliant on FinFET, with the Taiwanese fab not switching to GAA until the 2nm revision. With the Exynos 2500, the move to 3nm brings considerable efficiency gains, and that's borne out in everyday use; the foldable has a bigger 4,300mAh battery, and it manages to last up to a day with medium use — something that just wasn't possible on the Z Flip 6.</p><p>While it misses out on custom cores, Samsung LSI went with the latest Arm cores, and there are ten in total, two more than what you get on most mobile chipsets. I think ten cores are overkill, but Samsung clearly wanted to deliver better performance out of the workhorse cores.</p><p>As a result, the Exynos 2500 sees one Cortex X5 core clocked at 3.3GHz, and it is joined by two Cortex A725 cores at 2.74GHz, alongside five A725 running at 2.36GHz. You get the usual dual-core Cortex A520 at 1.8GHz to round out the design.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7</p></th><th  ><p>Vivo X200 Pro</p></th><th  ><p>Vivo X Fold 5</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Geekbench 6 (single-core)</strong></p></td><td  ><p>1857</p></td><td  ><p>2908</p></td><td  ><p>2381</p></td><td  ><p>2184</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Geekbench 6 (multi-core)</strong></p></td><td  ><p>6479</p></td><td  ><p>9452</p></td><td  ><p>7175</p></td><td  ><p>6330</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Geekbench AI (Quantized Score)</strong></p></td><td  ><p>3401</p></td><td  ><p>3767</p></td><td  ><p>2436</p></td><td  ><p>3326</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Geekbench testing shows that having more cores doesn't actually make a difference; the multi-core score is lower than the Snapdragon 8 Elite and Dimensity 9400, only outmatching the older Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. Similarly, the single-core result is among the lowest I've seen on any device, with even the Dimensity 8400-toting mid-range POCO X7 Pro coming close (1573).</p><p>Much like Google with its Tensor platform, it's clear that Samsung LSI was focused on delivering better gains than previous generations of Exynos designs rather than measuring up to what Qualcomm and MediaTek are doing in this category. While the Exynos 2500 doesn't score well in synthetic workloads, it has a much better showing in regular use. I didn't see much in the way of slowdowns or lag, and it just wasn't a problem in the month I used the foldable.</p><p>Samsung did a good job optimizing the hardware, and even though it may not be the best mobile platform by a long shot, it is definitely better than earlier Exynos models.</p><h2 id="a-gpu-upgrade-that-actually-makes-sense-2">A GPU upgrade that actually makes sense</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5239px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iRGEQeAQqbmMxSrXCj85Z5" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-gba-sp-6" alt="Mobapad controllers attached to 3D Printed mount for Galaxy Z Flip 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iRGEQeAQqbmMxSrXCj85Z5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5239" height="2947" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Exynos 2500 features an AMD RDNA 3-based Xclipse 950 GPU, and it has noticeable gains over preceding models.

Overheating and aggressive thermal throttling were a mainstay on earlier Exynos models, and that's thankfully not an issue on the Exynos 2500; the Flip 7 didn't overheat even in extended gaming sessions, and throttling was nowhere as pronounced.</p><p>Even though the hardware isn't the best you can get today, I enjoyed using the Galaxy Z Flip 7. Exynos 2500 isn't anywhere as limiting to use, and that alone is noteworthy. It's evident that Samsung doesn't want to rely entirely on Qualcomm when it comes to its high-end devices, and the changes to Exynos 2500 are meaningful. It will be interesting to see how Samsung can iterate on the design next year, but this is a good start.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The post states this integration with Sonos Voice Control will give users the ability to "switch lights on or off, dim or brighten, and activate scenes with their voice." Regarding lights, the email to Android Central earlier today (Sep 4) states users can adjust the brightness and color temperature of their Philips Hue lights with Voice Control.</p><p>This update will also bring smart plug control capabilities via mic-enabled Sonos products.</p><p>Philips Hue highlights a privacy-focused update between it and Sonos. The company states your voice is "processed entirely on the device." It says what you're saying is not sent to the cloud for processing and that there's no "recording," nor is an internet connection required to utilize Voice Control. Nathan Hart, senior product manager at Sonos, adds, "We built Sonos Voice Control to make controlling your music with your voice faster and easier than ever before, all with the privacy of your data staying right on your speaker."</p><p>This update is looking at a September launch in U.S. English and French for users worldwide.

That's just $50 more than the Galaxy S25 FE, and I'd argue that the Edge is a much better phone (if you don't mind taking a hit in battery life, of course). </p><p>On the other hand, the Galaxy S25 FE <em>has </em>introduced some upgrades that make the phone stand out from the crowd, and just looking at the specs, it seems to be the best FE phone that Samsung has produced in years. Is it the ultimate flagship killer? It's too soon to say, but I certainly wouldn't buy the device without a good deal attached. </p> ]]></dc:content>

That's a very broad term for components that are also used for a lot of other things, but it kind of fits here.</p><p>Most health sensors either emit light or detect light (or both if they're the expensive kind). That's because of all the things you can do with light, and two of the most interesting things are included on many wearable devices: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-can-measure-blood-oxygen-saturation-levels">blood oxygen level (SpO2)</a> monitoring and heart rate detection.</p><p>How can light tell me when my heart beats and how rich my blood is with oxygen? Remember that light doesn't only mean the light a human can see.</p><h2 id="types-of-light-2">Types of light</h2><figure class="van-image-figure pull-right inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="UtbAUMSaYAuYaH3iXHmZSG" name="Amazfit-Helio-Ring-review-04.jpg" alt="The Amazfit Helio Ring lighting up" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UtbAUMSaYAuYaH3iXHmZSG.jpg" mos="" align="right" fullscreen="1" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-right expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class="pull-right inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We're not going to go hard and deep with the technical details here; that's not what this article is about. Light is made of electromagnetic particles (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://quantumatlas.umd.edu/entry/photons/" target="_blank">photons</a>) that are emitted at a certain frequency, causing them to fill many parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. It's fascinating, and I encourage anyone interested to search out more details.</p><p>Our eyes can see light between about 400nm (blue) and 700nm (red) in that spectrum, and the lower wavelengths are commonly called ultraviolet, and the upper end is called infrared.</p><p>No two people see light the same way. For example, my blue shirt is blue to me, but that color is not the same as what you see. It's "blue" because of the wavelengths of visible light it reflects, and we learned what "blue" means to our eyes when we were young. "Blue" will change as we age, but so will our concept of what blue means.</p><p>Machines aren't like that. A box of properly calibrated sensors "sees" exactly the same color of blue. That's how any of this is possible — the sensors know what to look for, and it will be the same from product to product.</p><p>The two important bits here are light outside of the spectrum people can see, and that sensors will "see" things the same way.</p><h2 id="the-process-2">The process</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="f3Pn93oK9ZYwSQVWqfCEuJ" name="Garmin-Forerunner-970-ecg-sinus-rhythm" alt="The Garmin Forerunner 970 showing an ECG reading with Sinus Rhythm data." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f3Pn93oK9ZYwSQVWqfCEuJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'll use SpO2 reading as an example to illustrate how this can work, but methods such as heart rate detection and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-exec-health-forum-glucose-monitoring-highlighted" target="_blank">glucose monitoring</a> can also be implemented using the same principles.</p><p>Inside your wearable, there are tiny LEDs that shine on the thin skin of your wrist. You've probably seen them blinking green, but the two used for SpO2 measurement are <strong>red</strong> and <em><strong>infrared</strong></em><em> </em>(light you can't see that penetrates solids like your skin differently). Those LEDs blink at a specific interval, and some of the light they emit goes through your skin and into the tiny blood vessels.</p><p>There is a pair of dedicated photodiodes that gather the light reflected through the skin from those blood vessels while trying to block the light that doesn't go into your skin.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="c4T7xJpM3uxXn5Xzh9WkHS" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-3-sensors" alt="Close-up of the Google Pixel Watch 3's bottom sensor array" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/c4T7xJpM3uxXn5Xzh9WkHS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin absorb light differently. Hemoglobin that has been oxygenated absorbs <em>more</em> of the infrared light, so <strong>less infrared light will be reflected</strong> back to the photodiode. Hemoglobin that has been stripped of its oxygen does the opposite, absorbing more red light and reflecting less of it to the photodiodes.</p><p>The computer inside your wearable knows how much of each type of light was sent, based on its intensity. It also knows how much was reflected thanks to the photodiodes that measure it. It can then calculate what percentage of the hemoglobin in your blood is oxygenated based on the difference.</p><p>It's a tough idea to wrap your head around at first, but it's really just simple math at this point. A certain amount goes in, and a certain amount comes back. Calculate the difference and have the software make the number meaningful.</p><p>It's also the same way those little gadgets that doctors or nurses put on the tip of your finger to get SpO2 readings are used, but those are checked regularly and discarded<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ask-jerry-are-wearables-ready-to-be-medical-devices-yet"> if they lose calibration</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="rRqhJfgismGivjVXBGTjuf" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-BioActive-sensor" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic's bottom BioActive sensor with green, red, and blue lights activated when testing your skin for antioxidants." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rRqhJfgismGivjVXBGTjuf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>LEDs and photodiodes are also used for heart rhythm, heartbeat, glucose monitoring, and most anything that involves measuring your blood without actually sampling it. That's because specific things in your blood react to different light wavelengths differently.</p><p>You can combine this with what's called a Photoplethysmography (PPG for short, which measures volume based on size changes or your finger or wrist) sensor and a component that measures electricity to measure blood volume and electrical signals, and the time it takes them to travel to and from your heart. This can provide an ECG reading or determine your blood pressure.</p><p>Yes, if your wearable can do one of these things, then it is capable of doing the other, even if it's not programmed to do it.</p><p>These ideas aren't new, and they aren't only used to monitor your health from your ring or watch. However, making the components small enough and using less power was what it took to bring them to your wearable. Remember, you could also measure your heartbeat using many older Galaxy S phones because they had more room for the parts.</p><p>In the end, everything turns into math and numbers when you're a computer. Writing the software to make those numbers mean something is the hard part!</p> ]]></dc:content>

The Korean OEM announced this week that it has developed new features in collaboration with health brands to help users access virtual healthcare when needed.</p><p>"The updates include new virtual visits with doctors through Find Care in partnership with HealthTap, inclusion of Walgreens in Health Records' prescription tracking, and a fresh guided fitness program from iFIT," the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsungmobilepress.com/feature-stories/samsung-health-expands-seamless-access-to-care-anytime-anywhere/">press release added.</a></p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YnBYWc6SaY9bR4bK9mHUcW" name="Samsung-health-features-update" alt="Samsung brings virtual health care right to the app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YnBYWc6SaY9bR4bK9mHUcW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>To break things down further, the FindCare feature on the Health app will basically match you with virtual doctors, who are available either on the same day/week,  when you don't have the time for an in-person appointment or when your doctor isn't available at the drop of a hat.</p><p>It's a great alternative for those days you'd rather skip the Google symptom rabbit hole and just ask a pro for help. Samsung says users can also review upcoming appointments and basically text their doctor between video visits. If new symptoms start to develop or you need to get diagnostic tests done, FindCare has you covered.</p><p>Additionally, Samsung's Health Records feature will now be able to link up with Walgreens pharmacies (U.S. pharmacy chain), making it much easier to keep tabs on your prescriptions, check out past meds, and just generally stay on top of your health routine – all within the app.</p><p>Plus, you can easily add your prescription info from Health Records to the medication tracker, so you don't have to go hunting for your doctor's prescription.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CNFEsF8R8aG7BJUiZccGnK" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-ui-8-beta-1-running-together" alt="The Together feature in the Samsung Health app on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CNFEsF8R8aG7BJUiZccGnK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Finally, fitness enthusiasts also get a little something out of this update. The company is also rolling out premium fitness content so you stay on top of your fitness goals, with guided workouts.</p><p>Much like Apple's Fitness Plus, you can find "high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and Pilates to recovery routines, users can access videos, organized into categories like trending workouts and seasonal recommendations," Samsung added. That said, these new features start rolling out on Sept.8 on the Samsung Health App, helping users access care whenever they need it.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It's been just over a month since we got the ability to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-creative-photo-to-video-remix-rollout">convert photos into videos</a> in the Photos app, and today the company announced it is upgrading the underlying model to Veo 3.</p><p>For those unaware, photo-to-video in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos</a> lets users turn still images into short clips of about six seconds. The feature has been powered by Google's Veo 2 model until now, but the upgrade to Veo 3 should result in "even higher-quality clips."</p><h2 id="photo-to-video-gets-smarter-with-veo-3-2">Photo-to-video gets smarter with Veo 3</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Wij8egwjxwURLFSpN2ih7k" name="google-photos-to-video-mp4-ezgif.com-video-to-gif-converter" alt="Photo-to-video tool on Google Photos" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Wij8egwjxwURLFSpN2ih7k.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>To use this feature, the company is also rolling out its new "Create" tab in the Google Photos app. Now, along with Photos, Collection, and Search, you'll see a new "Create" tab at the bottom, where you can access all creative features.</p><p>To convert a photo into a video, head to the Create tab, select your photo, and pick between two prompts: "Subtle movement" or "I’m feeling lucky."</p><p>Google Photos then uses Veo 3 to create a short clip. You can share the video directly from the app or save it for later. Google says users get a "limited number of generations each day," with higher limits for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-assistant/new-google-ai-pro-and-ultra-subscription-plans-announced-at-io-event">Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers</a>.</p><p>Beyond photo-to-video, the Create tab also includes Remix, which converts images into anime, comic, sketch, or 3D animation styles. Another new feature is Highlight videos, letting you create clips with phrases like "Mom" and "Paris," after which it selects photos and videos, adds music, and builds a video.</p><p>Other features like collage, Cinematic photos, and Animations will also live in the Create tab.</p><p>Google says the new Create tab and photo-to-video powered by Veo 3 are now available to U.S. users. There's no word yet on when these features will roll out to other regions, but it should be sooner rather than later.</p> ]]></dc:content>

I have no idea how this thing is already <em>two years old</em>, but it's taken that time for me to amass a significant number of truly intriguing mixed reality games that are laying the groundwork for smart glasses gaming.</p><p>While we're expecting the first major commercial pair of smart glasses with a display <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-reportedly-low-sales-expectations-project-hypernova-smart-glasses-report">to debut this month</a>, the latest batch of rumors point to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-4">Meta Quest 4</a> looking a lot more like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/the-quest-4-might-slip-to-2027-but-meta-could-unveil-a-lighter-model-next-year-instead">a pair of tethered smart glasses</a> than a VR headset. That's excellent news for mixed reality games, which will be even more fun with lighter, slimmer headwear.</p><p>Meta Quest developers creating mixed reality apps are catering to gamers today and in the future. When smart glasses have the display and capability to run games, they'll be running many of the same types of games we're playing on Meta Quest 3 today, all without the bulk of a VR headset.</p><h2 id="banners-bastions-2">Banners & Bastions</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3YSkFsAZqdscgj7h8Ut9q4" name="banners-and-bastions-official-mixed-reality-screenshot" alt="Looking at the half-globe play space in mixed reality in the game Banners & Bastions on a Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3YSkFsAZqdscgj7h8Ut9q4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1440" height="810" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Banners & Bastions is a new bite-sized roguelike real-time strategy game from the creators of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/airspace-defender/7523170214434197">Airspace Defender</a>. Like that game, everything takes place in a "half snow globe" of sorts, placed conveniently on your lap. You can move this half-globe anywhere you want, so it's just as good a tabletop board game as it is a compact lap game you can play on a plane.</p><p>The gameplay is a bit similar to Steam favorite <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/688420/Bad_North_Jotunn_Edition/">Bad North</a>, but with several different recent roguelike gameplay trends blended in. Each level begins with a preview of the number and type of enemies that will appear, as well as each spawn point's estimated movement direction (handy for putting up walls).</p><p>Players choose units from a random collection of cards that appear on screen, tying into the roguelike nature of the game. You've got a finite amount of money to spend on units, so it's uncommon to buy more than 1-2 cards each turn. Units can be placed anywhere on the map and moved at any time, so while it's important to plan ahead, you can always move things around during combat.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w5Vcdv9qMAo" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Levels are completed in a linear fashion and awarded the traditional 3-star mobile score model. Stars can be used to unlock a sizable skill tree, and you'll unlock new cards and units as you progress in the game. Plus, emergency powers like raining down meteors or calling up reserve soldiers can be used to help keep your units intact between rounds.</p><p>The real draw of playing this in mixed reality is the degree of control you have over the action. The game is hand-tracking-only, which makes it far more convenient to play than most VR games since you only need to put the headset on and launch the game. Hand tracking is phenomenal these days. Even my son, who has historically hated hand tracking because it used to be very finicky, found Banners & Bastions' hand tracking to be super effective.</p><p>Building a mixed reality game that relies on hands instead of controllers ensures that, in a few years, smart glasses with displays and game-ready hardware will be able to play this kind of game on the go with no issue. It's so much better than squinting and struggling to tap the right unit on a phone screen. I also deeply appreciate the game's quick levels, which typically take only a few minutes each to complete, making it a perfect fit for portable gaming.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="0c17f65a-a2a9-4c0f-a3d0-c4bb7ce4568b" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$9.99 on Meta Quest" data-dimension48="$9.99 on Meta Quest" href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/banners-bastions/8387152738076399/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:406px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:99.75%;"><img id="CzZYsyiWqanzwoANRJABeN" name="banners-and-bastions-meta-quest-thumbnail" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CzZYsyiWqanzwoANRJABeN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="406" height="405" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>Protect your kingdom in glorious mixed reality with this excellent minimalist roguelike strategy game that prioritizes your time over extensive stats or town building.</p><p><a href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/banners-bastions/8387152738076399/" data-dimension112="0c17f65a-a2a9-4c0f-a3d0-c4bb7ce4568b" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$9.99 on Meta Quest" data-dimension48="$9.99 on Meta Quest" data-dimension25=""><strong>$9.99 on Meta Quest</strong></a></p></div><h2 id="mythic-realms-2">Mythic Realms</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bCmvvSveRUeCmC58MijqGm" name="mythic-realms-official-screenshot-mixed-reality-skeletons" alt="Fighting little skeletons in mixed reality on a Meta Quest 3 in the game Mythic Realms" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bCmvvSveRUeCmC58MijqGm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1440" height="810" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Mythic Realms is one of the most full-fledged mixed reality games I've played to date. While it starts off as a seemingly simple mixed reality game where you battle monsters in your own physical room, you quickly learn that this game isn't just a combat simulator.</p><p>Rather, this is a full roguelike RPG in the vein of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bethsoft.blade">The Elder Scrolls: Blades</a>. In fact, the gameplay loop is incredibly similar to that title, down to the concept of heading out on quests to gather resources and money to rebuild the town you call home. From blacksmiths who will improve your equipment to daily random events that'll keep you coming back to see what's happening, there's always something fun to do.</p><p>I actually audibly gasped when I realized the depth of the game, as many similar mixed reality titles with fantasy combat and randomized room layouts often just focus on combat and little else.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ojUhCPRdd5E" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>The town itself is fully virtual reality, so while that portion would need some adjustment to work properly on mixed reality glasses, I could see the company adapting the town concept to a diorama size that's a bit more manageable in mixed reality. I really enjoy seeing the town in VR, though, so it feels excellent in its current configuration for Meta Quest 3 and 3S headsets.</p><p>The way Mythic Realms transforms your playspace — even if you only have a small bedroom with very little walking space — is nothing short of incredible. Doors and windows become portals to another world, letting you see "outside" to a place that otherwise might not exist. Even the ceiling is replaced by open sky, which is peaceful and lovely until a fire-breathing dragon inevitably comes along and ruins your day.</p><p>But while the visuals are impressive enough, it's the gameplay loop that keeps bringing me back. I love the concept of a roguelike that mixes battle, crafting, and harvesting mechanics into one game. Every other roguelike I've ever played always just focuses on combat, while Mythic Realms offers plenty of combat-free situations throughout each run.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="1692484b-dc89-4f78-88c7-e5837af1b2e9" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$19.99 on Meta Quest" data-dimension48="$19.99 on Meta Quest" href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/mythic-realms/8364993590228690/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:406px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:99.75%;"><img id="TsVDiNQw6fHcUzXfTTJpVD" name="mythic-realms-official-artwork-meta-quest-thumbnail" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TsVDiNQw6fHcUzXfTTJpVD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="406" height="405" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>Transform your room into a lifesize roguelike game, complete with combat, fishing, hunting, mining, and more.

Other Wear OS watches won't get the update for some time, and trying out dozens of custom watch faces only made it clearer how exciting an exclusive feature this is.</p><p>After restricting old, battery-guzzling watch faces in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> with Watch Face Format (WFF), Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/wear-os/wear-os-6-will-bring-facer-back-onto-android-watches">worked with Facer</a> and other apps on a solution: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/05/whats-new-in-watch-faces.html">Watch Face Push API</a>.</p><p>With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a>, each watch face app gets one "slot" in your watch's favorites menu, visible by tapping and holding the display. Pick a watch face in the mobile app, and it pushes onto that slot. Your watch's storage isn't cluttered with old faces because your latest pick overwrites the old one.</p><p>You can use as many watch face apps as are compatible with Wear OS 6, but since most of them require a subscription for the best faces, you'll probably want to stick with just one. So, I looked through the options in Facer, TIMEFLIK, WatchMaker, and Pujie to see which stood out.</p><h2 id="facer-2">Facer</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div

Premium: $40/year or $5/month</strong></p><p>Facer is crammed with unofficial faces for popular brands like Pokémon, Totoro, Zelda, and Star Wars. However, Facer also has official brand partners, including SpongeBob, Garfield, Barbie, Star Trek, and Tetris, as well as "Watchmaker" faces designed to mimic luxury watch faces. You'll find plenty of high-quality designs to tempt you, along with the more amateurish ones.</p><p>The best aspect of Facer is that each face has a "power impact" rating, which warns you if it will affect your watch's battery life. You can also tap a Sun/Moon icon to swap between the active and AOD layout, checking in advance if the latter isn't too battery-intensive.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="VB5o2MMeTGzk37V4zFvu7m" name="Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-Facer-Borderlands" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic showing a custom Borderlands watch face from Facer, sitting next to a Galaxy phone showing the Facer app, with information about the watch face's "Power Impact" and ambient mode look." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VB5o2MMeTGzk37V4zFvu7m.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Facer has a wide range of Wear OS 6-compatible faces, and at least 100 are free if you want to try the app out without committing to Premium; considering Samsung and Google have about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/wear-os/we-weighed-galaxy-vs-pixel-watch-for-best-wear-os-watch-faces">60 and 30 official faces</a>, respectively, that's nothing to sneeze at — even if the best options are paid.</p><p>There's also the Facer Creator tool, where you can create your own custom designs; it's meant for publishing faces for people to download or buy, but you can simply save your designs to your account's "My Designs" folder and upload them to your watch.</p><h2 id="watchmaker-2">WatchMaker</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="T26PXfDGk8TVchJAuVgWwn" name="Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-WatchMaker-classic-face" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic on a person's wrist, showing a custom watch face from WatchMaker with a black, classic-style look." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/T26PXfDGk8TVchJAuVgWwn.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="vJX5tFoKo7Ew2mBWq8X3xn" name="Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-WatchMaker-face-Warossa" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic on a person's wrist, showing a custom watch face from the WatchMaker app imitating a Warossa watch." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vJX5tFoKo7Ew2mBWq8X3xn.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="oqbyiYPwSpsWRAqN5yXX5o" name="Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-WatchMaker-face-samsung-gear-s3" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic on a person's wrist, showing a custom watch face from the WatchMaker app of a Samsung Gear S3 watch." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oqbyiYPwSpsWRAqN5yXX5o.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p><strong>WatchMaker VIP: $20/year or $5/month</strong></p><p>WatchMaker has hundreds of thousands of WFF faces, though only 30 free ones at any one time.

In a press release, the company states consumers will find a 7.2-inch FHD Plus display; however, the 60 Ultra rocks TCL's new NXTPAPER 4.0 technology. It seems like the new 60 Ultra will join the likes of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/tcl-nxtpaper-4-fixes-one-of-the-technologys-biggest-hidden-issues">TCL's NXTPAPER 11 Plus tablet</a> with this enhanced, seven-core display tech.</p><p>This 4.0 screen tech offers a natural light display with zero flickering, blue light purification, no reflection, anti-glare, and more. TCL claims its NXTPAPER 4.0 is natural and should give the feeling as though you're staring at the real world, sans any digital displays.</p><p>This display can also "switch to warmer tones" once night falls to create a more comfortable experience that evolves as the day does. Moreover, it may also help users get to sleep better as the lack of blue light won't mess with their circadian rhythm.</p><h2 id="nxtpaper-cameras-ai-2">NXTPAPER cameras & AI</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:150.00%;"><img id="cNXYJFwC83wsh96rQCDvw6" name="tcl-nxtpaper-60-ultra-on-table" alt="A TCL NXTPAPER 60 Ultra lying on a table beside flowers and some scattered papers." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cNXYJFwC83wsh96rQCDvw6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="400" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: TCL)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Other hardware specs include a circular triple camera array on the back of the 60 Ultra. TCL states this will provide consumers with a 50MP main camera, a 50MP telephoto with a 3x zoom, and an 8UW camera, per its official document. On the front, consumers will find a 32MP lens.</p><p>Powering the device is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-7400-7400x-ultra-efficient-gaming-ai-chips">MediaTek's Dimensity 7400</a> SoC, an ultra-efficient chip capable of handling games and AI.</p><p>Artificial intelligence is another aspect that TCL has focused on for its 60 Ultra. More specifically, the company states its AI, such as the TCL Note app and the Max Ink Mode, helps users interested in reading and writing daily. The former is said to offer a paper-like writing experience with AI tools to help users be more productive. The Max Ink Mode offers a "distraction-free" experience for users looking to read without being bothered by notifications.</p><h2 id="the-60-ultra-s-junior-and-a-new-watch-2">The 60 Ultra's Junior and a new Watch</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:900px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="J9UV7nNLcAuHuRWPy85DdK" name="tcl-nxtpaper-60-ultra-stylus" alt="A model using the TCL NXTPAPER 60 Ultra and its stylus outside." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/J9UV7nNLcAuHuRWPy85DdK.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="900" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: TCL)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:850px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:70.59%;"><img id="DLTkQnZFwKMVw39oJoWsCX" name="tcl-nxtpaper-5g-junior" alt="The new NXTPAPER 5G Junior, a device aimed at younger users with eye-safe displays and a Digital Detox feature." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DLTkQnZFwKMVw39oJoWsCX.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="850" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: TCL)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:899px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.74%;"><img id="Nt2eHdRisDrftdEN5Xg5DX" name="tcl-nxtpaper-mt48-kids-smartwatch" alt="A pink TCL MOVETIME MT48 smartwatch on a young model in a library." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Nt2eHdRisDrftdEN5Xg5DX.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="899" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: TCL)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Rounding things out for the 60 Ultra is 12GB of RAM (plus an additional 12GB via RAM expansion) with up to 512GB of storage.

Younger users will also find a "Digital Detox Mode," capable of helping them cut out distractions for a digital life that's not so jarring and hectic. This phone, with 256GB of storag,e starts at €249 (~$290). TCL states the 5G Junior will hit the European market in October.</p><p>Additionally, the TCL MOVETIME MT48 smartwatch for kids was also announced.

Coupled with a 1.68-inch display, the MOVETIME MT48 starts at €150 (~$174) in preparation for its late October launch in Germany, the UK, Spain, Italy, and France.</p> ]]></dc:content>

However, it now looks like YouTube will soon crack down on users sharing accounts outside their household.</p><p>It seems YouTube has started notifying users who are part of a Family plan but not physically located in the same household as the family manager.

One turns the Fenix 8 Pro into a true standalone smartwatch; the other gives it fantastic visuals, at the expense of battery life.</p><p>Announced on September 3, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/1701921/">Garmin Fenix 8 Pro AMOLED</a> ships in two sizes: 47mm ($1,200) and 51mm ($1,300), making it just $100 more than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Garmin Fenix 8</a>. In exchange, you can subscribe to the InReach service and stay connected with friends and family on long outdoor excursions, whether your phone is dead, at home, or out of LTE range.</p><p>The Fenix 8 Pro MicroLED only comes in one 51mm size ($2,000); while cheaper than the Garmin MARQ series, it's still one of Garmin's most expensive models ever. In exchange, you get the brighest smartwatch display ever, courtesy of 400,000 individual LEDs that prevent the burn-in you get with AMOLED displays.</p><p>Here's everything we've learned about the Garmin Fenix 8 Pro, including how much an LTE/ satellite subscription costs and where it's available, how the Pro compares to the Fenix 8 for battery life, and what the fuss is with MicroLED displays.</p><h2 id="how-lte-and-satellite-works-on-the-garmin-fenix-8-pro-2">How LTE and satellite works on the Garmin Fenix 8 Pro</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8192px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="okKMT5B8g8bfLdHtTzrvBh" name="Garmin-Fenix-8-Pro-press-photo-4" alt="A photo of a woman kayaking while wearing a Garmin Fenix 8 Pro, using it to call someone using LTE cellular data." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/okKMT5B8g8bfLdHtTzrvBh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8192" height="4608" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Garmin Fenix 8 Pro currently gets cellular coverage in 34 countries and territories, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/connectivity/fenix8pro/coverage/">listed here</a>. Essentially, it's available in the U.S. and Canada, most of Europe, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand.</p><p>While an Apple or Android watch with LTE can use your phone number and native messaging, the Fenix 8 Pro must use Garmin's InReach plan, which messages directly through Garmin Messenger.</p><p>Your contacts will need to download Messenger to call you or send voice messages; you can text people without Messenger, but they'll receive that text from a random Garmin number.</p><p>The Fenix 8 Pro uses low-powered LTE-M cellular networks instead of standard LTE. Standard LTE towers typically have LTE-M signals, too, so you should get coverage wherever your phone normally would. Garmin says this LTE-M solution maximizes your watch's battery life, but that these signals are more susceptible to getting blocked by large concrete or steel buildings.</p><p>Previously, the Fenix 8 could send messages through Garmin Messenger, but only with an InReach satellite device as an intermediary. Now, the Fenix 8 Pro can stand alone, letting you stay connected via cellular or satellite.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2088px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:76.63%;"><img id="boyDaQ3KEFjVKZxvAjw84F" name="Garmin-Fenix-8-Pro-satellite-coverage-north-america" alt="A map showing the Garmin InReach satellite and cellular coverage areas for the Garmin Fenix 8 Pro in North America." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/boyDaQ3KEFjVKZxvAjw84F.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2088" height="1600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2094px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:76.41%;"><img id="qRLWyZ6SuFeoAxh4hdALwE" name="Garmin-Fenix-8-Pro-satellite-coverage-europe" alt="A map showing the Garmin InReach satellite and cellular coverage areas for the Garmin Fenix 8 Pro in Europe." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qRLWyZ6SuFeoAxh4hdALwE.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2094" height="1600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>A Fenix 8 Pro InReach account includes both LTE and satellite messaging.

Japan, Australia, and New Zealand are excluded.</p><p>Any areas above 65ºN, such as Northern Canada, can't get a satellite signal because "the satellite network will orbit below the horizon." But in the eligible areas, you should always be able to sync with Skylo satellites as long as there aren't any trees or terrain obstructing the connection.</p><p>Garmin says it'll take about 30 seconds to establish a satellite connection, then about 10 seconds to send your messages; it'll then maintain the connection long enough to receive any queued messages from others.</p><p>Unlike Garmin's dedicated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-inreach-messenger-plus-announced">InReach Messenger Plus</a>, the Fenix 8 Pro can't send voice messages or photos over satellite; you'll need an LTE connection.

But these new features come with noticeable trade-offs, aside from the higher price.</p><p>The Fenix 8 Pro 47mm measures 16mm thick, or 2.2mm thicker than the Fenix 8 47mm; the 51mm Pro measures 16.5mm (a 1.8mm gap), while the 51mm Pro MicroLED hits a whopping 17.5mm thick.</p><p>The Fenix 8 was already on the thick side for Garmin watches; now, the Pro lineup is significantly bulkier than nearly any fitness watch on the market, and likely won't be especially comfortable for sleep tracking; you'll probably want to get the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-index-sleep-monitor-comfortable-band-insightful-health-data-launch">Garmin Index Sleep Monitor</a>, too.</p><p>Thankfully, the Fenix 8-to-8-Pro weight gap is negligible, so it won't be less comfortable. Still, the Fenix 8 was already on the heavy side if you're used to Garmin models that use fiber-reinforced polymer instead of titanium.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="eJdCTaTDPe9awCzVhgfudX" name="Garmin-Fenix-8-side-view" alt="A close-up side view of the Garmin Fenix 8 with the default watch face" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eJdCTaTDPe9awCzVhgfudX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Garmin Fenix 8 47mm </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Fenix 8 and 8 Pro share identical training software and map tools, plus the same design perks like sapphire glass, 10 ATM water resistance with dive-proof buttons, and an MIL-STD-810H rating for thermal and shock.</p><p>While the Fenix 8 Pro is longer-lived than most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watches</a>, it does lose some battery life compared to the base model.

The Pixel 10 series is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-esim">eSIM-only</a> in the U.S. However, it turns out there is at least one way to get a Pixel 10 device in the U.S. with a physical SIM card slot.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/09/02/google-pixel-10-replacements-physical-sim-support-rma/">9to5Google</a>, users requesting replacement Pixel 10 devices are receiving the global version, which has the SIM card slot at the top. The publication cited a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1n6tegp/rmaed_a_pixel_10_pro_xl_new_replacement_has/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1">Reddit post</a> where a user requested a replacement Pixel 10 Pro XL due to a "screen issue."</p><p>Apparently, the unit shipped to them was not the U.S. version but a global model complete with a SIM slot. The device was identical to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-xl-vs-pixel-9-pro-xl">Pixel 10 Pro XL</a> they had, just with the SIM slot on top.</p><h2 id="physical-sim-pixel-10-units-lack-mmwave-5g-2">Physical SIM Pixel 10 units lack mmWave 5G</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VhiW4KqroShFTegj5eBMKH" name="pixel-10-pro-xl-sim-slot-usa" alt="Pixel 10 Pro XL with a SIM slot" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VhiW4KqroShFTegj5eBMKH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Reddit)</span></figcaption></figure><p>And it hasn't happened with only one user. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1n6tegp/comment/nc3yxni/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">Another Redditor</a> in the same thread reported the same, though they didn't specify their Pixel 10 model. The original poster said they had reached out to Google about why they had received a physical SIM version, but hadn't yet received a reply.</p><p>As it turns out, however, there is one drawback for U.S. users getting a physical SIM version of the Pixel 10. The U.S. eSIM-only units support <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/explaining-5g-millimeter-wave-sub-6-low-band-and-other-terms-you-need-know">mmWave 5G networks</a>, while global SIM models do not. So if you get that version in the US, you'll miss out on the fastest speeds and must rely on sub-6GHz 5G only.</p><p>That said, it appears there's still no way to directly get a physical SIM Pixel 10 from Google. It looks like the company is only providing replacement units, and we expect even those will soon be swapped out for the eSIM variant in the U.S.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/1943169/614286/10014?subId1=ac-us-5420766087977553015&sharedId=ac-us&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Ftop-deals%2Fcell-phone-deals%2Fpcmcat1563302848653.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat1563302848653" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1690538&xcust=ac_us_4103361842085162595&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1943169%2F565706%2F9383%3FsubId1%3Dac-us-4792126853743754287%26sharedId%3Dac-us%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.walmart.com%252Fcp%252Fcell-phones%252F1105910%253Fpovid%253Dweb_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.androidcentral.com%2Fphones%2Fsamsung-galaxy%2Fsamsung-brings-one-ui-8-beta-to-older-flagships-and-mid-range-phones" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://shop-links.co/link?publisher_slug=future&exclusive=1&u1=ac-us-8840006662694302210&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fshop%2Fall-deals%2Fcell-phone-deals%2F&article_name=One%20UI%208%20is%20nearly%20ready%20for%20the%20Galaxy%20S25%2C%20with%20a%20fifth%20beta%20now%20rolling%20out&article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.androidcentral.com%2Fphones%2Fsamsung-galaxy%2Fone-ui-8-beta-5-for-samsung-galaxy-s25" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dcell%2Bphone%26crid%3D19CKV7OMEPEMF%26sprefix%3Dcell%2Bphone%252Caps%252C222%26ref%3Dnb_sb_noss_1%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1377800089846706275-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100048248-15733793?sid=ac-us-3245051012332737972&url=https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100048248-15735111?sid=ac-us-1233504750112697981&url=https://www.att.com/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The tablets are designed to understand and react to what you're doing, whether you're typing, speaking, or looking at something on screen. Gemini Live is a key feature, and it lets you have a natural back-and-forth about on-screen content or even real-world objects seen through the camera.</p><p>There’s also Drawing Assist for cleaning up sketches, Writing Assist to help refine your tone, and a floating AI overlay that you can easily tap while you multitask. Samsung is making these AI capabilities available for free until the end of 2025.</p><h2 id="a-true-mobile-workstation-2">A true mobile workstation</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="aAHo8NoVaxPv2aexFa3biW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-S11-1" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 and S11 Ultra." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aAHo8NoVaxPv2aexFa3biW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>But where the Galaxy Tab S11 really stands out is with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-samsung-dex">Samsung DeX</a>. The new Extended Mode turns your tablet and an external monitor into a true dual-screen setup.

It has a new cone-shaped tip that allows for a wider range of angles and a hexagonal design for a more comfortable grip. The new Quick Tools puts all your drawing and editing options a tap away, while Sticky Note lets you scribble right on top of your Samsung Notes without switching apps.

While the Galaxy S25 FE bears a striking resemblance to its predecessor, it does pack a sneaky set of upgrades including a new chip, upgraded front-facing camera, and a bigger battery with faster charging. For small tablet lovers, there's finally a new 11-inch Galaxy Tab S11 to go along with the behemoth <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/samsungs-galaxy-tab-s11-ultra-is-here-and-it-aims-to-replace-your-laptop">Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra</a>.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-launches-galaxy-s25-fe">Samsung Galaxy S25 FE</a> is the first Galaxy S25 phone to run <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/my-8-favorite-things-about-the-one-ui-8-beta">One UI 8</a>, based on Android 16. It's a small detail, and the other four Galaxy S25 devices will get the update eventually, but it goes to show how Samsung is bridging the gap between midrange and flagship territory with the Galaxy S25 FE. Meanwhile, the Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra is even thinner and sports a fresh processor as well.</p><p>I briefly went hands-on with Samsung's new phone and tablets at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/ifa">IFA 2025</a>, and I have to admit, I'm excited. It's good to have a small, current-generation tablet in Samsung's lineup again, and it's great to see the Galaxy S25 FE fleshed out as a flagship-killer. Here's everything you need to know about them.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-specs"><span>Specs</span></h2><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol empty" ></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy S25 FE</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy Tab S11</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.7-inch<br>2340 x 1080 FHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2X   </p></td><td  ><p>11-inch<br>2560 × 1600 Dynamic AMOLED 2X, 120 Hz     </p></td><td  ><p>14.6-inch<br>2960 × 1848 Dynamic AMOLED 2X, 120 Hz     </p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Deca-core Exynos 2400 (4 nm)   </p></td><td  ><p>MediaTek Dimensity 9400 Plus     </p></td><td  ><p>MediaTek Dimensity 9400 Plus </p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Memory</p></td><td  ><p>8GB</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td><td  ><p>12GB (16GB with 1TB storage)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>128GB, 256GB, 512GB</p></td><td  ><p>128GB, 256GB, 512GB</p></td><td  ><p>256GB, 512GB, 1TB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Operating system</p></td><td  ><p>One UI 8</p></td><td  ><p>One UI 8</p></td><td  ><p>One UI 8</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Front camera</p></td><td  ><p>12 MP f/2.2   </p></td><td  ><p>12 MP (Ultra Wide 120°)     </p></td><td  ><p>12 MP (Ultra Wide 120°) </p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear cameras</p></td><td  ><p>12 MP f/2.2 (Ultra Wide) 50 MP f/1.8 (Wide)<br>8 MP 3x f/2.4 (Telephoto)   </p></td><td  ><p>13 MP     </p></td><td  ><p>13 MP<br>8 MP (Ultra Wide)     </p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>4,900mAh   </p></td><td  ><p>8,400mAh</p></td><td  ><p>11,600mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging</p></td><td  ><p>45W Super Fast Charging Fast Wireless Charging 2.0 Wireless PowerShare</p></td><td  ><p>45W Super Fast Charging</p></td><td  ><p>45W Super Fast Charging</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>161.3 x 76.6 x 7.4 mm   </p></td><td  ><p>165.3 x 253.8 x 5.5 mm     </p></td><td  ><p>208.5 x 326.3 x 5.1 mm     </p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>190g</p></td><td  ><p>469g     </p></td><td  ><p>690g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>IP rating</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Jetblack, Navy, Icyblue, White</p></td><td  ><p>Grey, Silver     </p></td><td  ><p>Grey, Silver</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-s25-fe"><span>Samsung Galaxy S25 FE</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="y2Uyt2etCfqQJoktXPs4EF" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-FE-2" alt="The Samsung Galaxy S25 FE in hands-on photos." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y2Uyt2etCfqQJoktXPs4EF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When I first held the Samsung Galaxy S25 FE, it felt quite similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-hands-on">Galaxy S24 FE</a>, but the differences became quickly apparent. The glossy back of the Galaxy S24 FE, which ended up being a fingerprint magnet, is now gone in favor of a smooth matte finish. It's available in Jetblack, Navy, Icyblue, and White, and I think the darker colors pair nicely with the silver aluminum side rails to create an excellent contrasting look.</p><p>The rear side of the phone has a basic triple-camera array, much like the three main Galaxy S25 models, albeit without the DSLR-style lens covers. It also doesn't have the oval-shaped camera bump riser we see on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review">Galaxy S25 Edge</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>.

The Galaxy S25 FE isn't breaking any records, but its thinner 7.4mm profile is certainly a welcomed addition compared to the 8mm thickness of its predecessor. On the design front, it's also 23 grams lighter than the previous model, weighing in at only 190 grams. Anytime you can get a 6.7-inch smartphone under 200 grams, it's worth taking note of — this is a difference you'll feel in both your hand and pocket.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BHuZTijDCu3hRigV5AUKZF" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-FE-6" alt="The Samsung Galaxy S25 FE in hands-on photos." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BHuZTijDCu3hRigV5AUKZF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, there's not much new about the display. The panel itself isn't bad at all; it's a 6.7-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2x screen with support for 120Hz refresh rates. However, the bezels on the Galaxy S25 FE still aren't uniform, leaving you with a larger "chin" below the bottom of the display. It's an unfortunate characteristic that may be distracting to some and makes the phone feel cheaper than it is.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5MFLoWPjddb7oCNtfNvymM" name="S25-FE-Bezels" alt="The bezels on the Samsung Galaxy S25 FE that aren't uniform." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5MFLoWPjddb7oCNtfNvymM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Galaxy S25 FE is now powered by the Samsung Exynos 2400 chip, a slight bump from the lower-spec Exynos 2400e found within the Galaxy S24 FE. You get the same 8GB of memory and 128GB of base storage, though it can be upgraded to 512GB for the first time.</p><p>There are clear performance limitations here, at least going off the spec sheet, but Samsung managed to cram even more AI features in the Galaxy S25 FE. It gets many of the best One UI 7 and One UI 8 tools, like the ProVisual Engine for the camera system and the Now Bar and Brief. Speaking of the cameras, the front-facing sensor is upgraded to 12MP on this year's model.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5rdejtR6KaGiswQ6FaeZZF" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-FE-3" alt="The Samsung Galaxy S25 FE in hands-on photos." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5rdejtR6KaGiswQ6FaeZZF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Battery capacity is upped to 4,900mAh and there's now support for 45W wired fast charging, which should help deliver all-day battery life.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-tab-s11"><span>Samsung Galaxy Tab S11</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="aqrPxCEh3Xb58tN5A29XWo" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-S11-8" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 with the Book Cover Keyboard attached." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aqrPxCEh3Xb58tN5A29XWo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you recall, there was never a Samsung Galaxy Tab S10, so the Galaxy Tab S11 marks the first 11-inch flagship tablet from Samsung in over two years. In the time since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9">Galaxy Tab S9</a> released, a lot has changed and a bunch has stayed the same, too. The overall look and feel of the Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 is still here, but it's thinner at 5.5mm compared to 5.9mm.</p><p>Samsung kept the same display for the Galaxy Tab S11, an 11-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2x panel with 120Hz support. There is a new stylus to pair with it, as Samsung redesigned the S Pen to be more ergonomic and add tilt-based writing and drawing features. The S Pen is now hexagon-shaped, with six flat sides that end in a cone-shaped tip for drawing.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xPoccTwjDz7bMSngXxoPxA" name="New-S-Pen" alt="The new S Pen for tablets (left) compared to a regular pencil (right)." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xPoccTwjDz7bMSngXxoPxA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The new S Pen for tablets (left) compared to a regular pencil (right).  </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This feels like using a standard pencil, and I find it more comfortable and natural to use than the old S Pen and the Apple Pencil — both only have one flat side.

There is a 16GB memory option, but it only comes with the 1TB storage configuration, so it'll be an expensive upgrade. There's no doubt that the Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra is powerful, and Samsung is trying to capitalize on that power in software this year.</p><p>You get a new version on Samsung DeX on both tablets called Extended Mode, which lets you take advantage of both your Galaxy Tab S11 screen and an external monitor. You can use this for multitasking, dragging and dropping content between screens, or present separate content on each display. Another new way to use Samsung DeX is with workspaces — you can create up to four separate desktop environments for different tasks in DeX mode.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CbbTUYWHZABsAXJqhxp5mW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-S11-2" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 and S11 Ultra." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CbbTUYWHZABsAXJqhxp5mW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Of course, these enhanced DeX features will be most useful on the Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra, which packs a 14.6-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2x screen. It's designed to be paired with the Book Cover Keyboard Slim for those who want to turn the tablet into a laptop alternative. Personally, I find the sheer size of the Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra to be daunting — it's too big for what I prefer to use tablets for. However, you might enjoy having that extra screen real estate for productivity and content consumption.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="aAHo8NoVaxPv2aexFa3biW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-S11-1" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 and S11 Ultra." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aAHo8NoVaxPv2aexFa3biW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The side profile of the Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Finally, it's worth calling out that the Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra is now just 5.1mm thick, which is a crazy number. With that being said, I didn't get the same "wow" factor from holding the Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra as I got from using the Galaxy S25 Edge. The thickness simply doesn't seem as big of a deal on a tablet compared to a phone, but it <em>does</em> matter if you like to use a case or keyboard cover attached.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-availability"><span>Availability</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nerFJgEwc5cZz5tYCUgutW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-FE-All-Colors" alt="All four colors of the Samsung Galaxy S25 FE." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nerFJgEwc5cZz5tYCUgutW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 FE is available starting now, Sept. 4, in four colors: Jetblack, Navy, Icyblue, and White.

The publication claims the device will offer three major features: wireless charging, reverse wireless charging, and NFC capabilities for "practicality" reasons. While these are elements to a handheld device that we typically expect from flagships nowadays, the post says Samsung is also focusing on the trifold's longevity.</p><p>Foldables, whether they're like the clamshell Flip 7, the book-style Fold 7, or these larger three-screen "trifolds," the publication says Samsung is supposedly looking to address durability concerns. To do this, the post claims the device is taking an "inward-folding" approach, which will enable Samsung's design to protect its "main display when folded."</p><p>This also takes us back to another alleged feature: the trifold's G-folding method. The post suspects that this mechanism will aid the device in keeping dust and other debris away from this sensitive folding display when folded shut. Additionally, there are rumors that Samsung has taken some of its work with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-finally-pulls-ahead-of-the-flip-in-sales-in-korea">Flip 7 and Fold 7's</a> hinge to increase the longevity of the trifold's folding lifespan.</p><h2 id="the-long-awaited-trifold-2">The long-awaited trifold</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="4txujVEQvBDeorsM3bCXXE" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-flip-7-mint-hands-on-4" alt="Samsung Galaxy Fold 7 and Flip 7 in Mint hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4txujVEQvBDeorsM3bCXXE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1407" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are some important notes to make here from these rumors, especially about the trifold's potential inspiration for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-says-galaxy-z-fold-7-screen-decade-long-durability-report">increased hinge/folding longevity</a>. Shortly after the latest Galaxy foldables launched, Samsung discussed its Fold 7 and how its upgraded screen and other mechanics could help it withstand up to a decade's worth of folds. The company stated its latest screen tests show that it can survive up to 500,000 folds, which would take the "average user" up to 10 years to reach.</p><p>The phone's UTG (ultra thin glass) also got an upgrade, which should help reduce the appearance of a crease even more.</p><p>On a related note, there were some rumors just recently that seemingly came <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-trifold-leak-one-ui-animations-qi2-nfc-into-focus">straight from Samsung's One UI software</a>. The leaked animations seemed to suggest NFC, wireless, and reverse wireless charging. What surfaced showed that the majority of this will be done via the right-most side of the phone, where its vertical triple camera array resides.</p><p>Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-galaxy-z-trifold-and-android-xr-headset-are-finally-landing-this-year">has confirmed</a> that its trifold is looking at a second half of 2025 launch. It's still up in the air when that could take place.

Even using high-tech codecs like LDAC doesn't deliver <em>true</em> hi-res audio because there's always a level of compression between your phone and Bluetooth earbuds.</p><p>Audiophiles worried about downgrading their audio quality by switching to a Galaxy S25 have nothing to fear. Samsung's engineers have ensured that you get excellent quality audio from the Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25 Plus, and Galaxy S25 Ultra, regardless of how you're listening to music.</p><p>While the Galaxy S25 family doesn't have a traditional 3.5mm headphone jack, you can always pick up an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Headphone-Adapter-JSAUX-Compatible-Samsung/dp/B07XYQ2ZKH/">inexpensive USB-C to 3.5mm adapter</a> to connect wired headphones to a Galaxy S25. Thankfully, there's nothing to configure or pair when you use a pair of wired headphones. Just plug them in and enjoy the tunes!</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">best music streaming service</a>, Tidal Hi-Fi, works perfectly on the Galaxy S25 Ultra and is even better when paired with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-headphones">best USB-C headphones</a>. This ensures that you don't have to worry about remembering your adapter, and also never have to worry about charging a pair of headphones or earbuds just to use them.

Samsung prefers LDAC over aptX HD, so be sure to look for LDAC when you choose a pair of Bluetooth earbuds or headphones to get the highest possible wireless sound quality. The Galaxy S25 family supports SBC, AAC, LDAC, and Samsung Seamless Codec for Bluetooth playback.</p><p>While LDAC and aptX HD are the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-to-stream-hi-res-music-from-phone">best way to stream hi-res audio</a>, there's no such thing as true lossless audio over Bluetooth. A Bluetooth signal <em>always</em> has to be compressed to some degree, and while most people probably can't tell the difference between a good pair of wired headphones and high-quality hi-res Bluetooth earbuds, audiophiles won't be fooled.</p><p>That being said, only Sony phones deliver higher-quality audio playback, as our sister site <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.whathifi.com/smartphones-tablets/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra">What Hi-Fi pointed out</a> in their Galaxy S25 Ultra review.

They (unsurprisingly) support Sony's LDAC codec, which is perfect for the Galaxy S25 family.</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DCQ4GLL2"><strong>Bowers & Wilkins Pi8</strong></a>: We recommend these for non-Samsung Android phones, as they primarily support the aptX HD codec for hi-res audio transfer.</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Edifier-NeoBuds-Plus-Cancelling-Bluetooth/dp/B0DHRMD3JT/"><strong>Edifier NeoBuds Plus</strong></a>: A more budget-conscious choice that still supports LDAC and hi-res sound.</li></ul><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-does-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-s-sound-quality-really-compete-with-apple-or-sony"><span>Does the Samsung Galaxy S25's sound quality really compete with Apple or Sony?</span></h2><p>Sony has long been considered the de facto standard for Android phone audio quality, but Samsung is no slouch in the audio department. While Apple notably enhanced its audio quality with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16</a> release, the Galaxy S25 family isn't too far behind, offering crisp and detailed audio quality, specializing particularly in delivering clear vocals.</p><p>Audio reviews of the Galaxy S25 family have often noted that low-level dynamics aren't quite as good as Apple's or Sony's latest phones, but that the S25 family is still in the overall top tier when it comes to sound reproduction. That's particularly true when using the built-in speaker on the S25 family, as Samsung's use of Dolby Atmos tuning transforms the phone's speakers into a virtual wall of sound.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 family supports everything you need to get a high-quality audio experience on the go. Wired headphones using a USB-C cable are the best option for the highest possible quality sound, while Bluetooth earbuds that support hi-res LDAC audio are the second-best option. We recommend browsing our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/what-are-the-best-headphones-to-pair-with-the-galaxy-s25-for-premium-sound">best Galaxy S25 premium headphones</a> guide so you can get a full understanding of what's available and what makes them the best for Samsung's 2025 flagships.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-is-the-audio-quality-consistent-across-different-apps-on-the-s25"><span>Is the audio quality consistent across different apps on the S25?</span></h2><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 family's audio quality is managed on a system level to ensure consistent audio quality between apps. Samsung offers a built-in audio equalizer with support for several Dolby Atmos profiles, sound presets, adaptive age filters, and even a UHQ upscaler for supported wired headphones.</p><p>While some apps may have individual equalizers that can be used in addition to the system equalizer, it's recommended to use Samsung's built-in option for the most consistent audio quality.</p><p>Each type of audio source can have its own settings, too, and the Galaxy S25 will intelligently remember which settings you prefer for each audio source. For example, if I connect my Bluetooth <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro</a> to my Galaxy S25 Ultra, it will have individual settings I've tailored for it, while a pair of wired headphones will have a different set of settings saved and automatically applied.</p><p>Apps can individually have their own sound profiles, too. Here's how to configure that:</p><p>1. Launch your audio app of choice and <strong>start playing a song or video</strong>.</p><p>2. Pull down on the right side of the status bar and <strong>long-press the volume slider</strong>.</p><p>3. A <strong>Sound and effects</strong> box will appear with audio options for the specific app that's playing audio.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3030px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.73%;"><img id="RqGYRQGPb4w72XCqtcarKg" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-app-audio" alt="Adjusting app audio settings on the Galaxy S25" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RqGYRQGPb4w72XCqtcarKg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3030" height="3052" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This way, each app can have its own distinct audio settings. This is particularly useful for adjusting audio mixes between video, music, and other sound sources. To reconfigure an app's audio properties, follow the steps above or go to the main audio section by following these steps:</p><p>1. Open system settings by navigating to the <strong>Settings</strong> option in the app drawer, or pulling down on the right side of the status bar and tapping the settings gear icon on the top right.</p><p>2. Select <strong>Sounds and vibration</strong> from the list.</p><p>3. Select <strong>Sound quality and effects</strong> from the list.</p><p>4. Select <strong>App sound settings</strong> from the list.</p><p>5. Select the app you want to adjust audio properties for.

Individual hearing profiles can be made to adjust for hearing loss for different age ranges, as well as sound tuning via a 9-slider equalizer with various presets. Each audio source also includes its own customizable preset that is automatically saved.</p><p>To access the system-level equalizer and sound profiles, follow these steps:</p><p>1. Open system settings by navigating to the <strong>Settings</strong> option in the app drawer, or pulling down on the right side of the status bar and tapping the settings gear icon on the top right.</p><p>2. Select <strong>Sounds and vibration</strong> from the list.</p><p>3. Select <strong>Sound quality and effects</strong> from the list.</p><p>4.

Once you've done that, open the equalizer section and tune the sound further. Equalizer allows you to very specifically tune the audio profile, while the presets and the Dolby Atmos section are more automated.</p><p>Additionally, you might want to select <strong>Boost dialogue</strong> when listening to a podcast or other audio source where human speech is the most important thing to hear. You can also choose <strong>Loudness normalization</strong> to help keep explosions and other loud sound effects from hurting your ears while watching movies or videos.</p><p>Folks looking for age-specific audio profiles should choose <strong>Adapt sound</strong>, then select your specific age bracket from the list. Clicking the gear icon next to each age bracket allows you to also choose which ear will primarily use audio for phone calls, and if you prefer a clear or soft sound profile.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Google just announced a whole host of new Android features, AI-powered tools,  and an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-drop-september-material-3-expressive-expansion-adaptive-audio">exclusive Pixel feature drop today </a>(Sept. 3). This update brings several fun tools for Android users, along with expanded support for LE Audio sharing and Auracast.</p><p>Users will finally be able to pair two <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-you-need-know-about-bluetooth-le-audio">LE Audio Bluetooth headphones</a> to one phone, so two people can listen to the same track at the same time. No more trying to hit play at the exact same moment — you'll both be in sync! This just makes it more intimate for two people to basically watch anything together, whether you're at a cafe or on a plane; watching your favorite show becomes seamless.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="tp8W5DJ8UJHVqVtgYh6rsV" name="Audiorsharing-Auracast-LE-audio" alt="Android Sept update brings Auracast and LE audio sharing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tp8W5DJ8UJHVqVtgYh6rsV.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="800" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>And this feature isn't limited to just two people; if you're with a group and want to share a catchy soundtrack you've just been hooked onto,  you can also share the audio with multiple people, thanks to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/i-tried-bluetooth-auracast-at-ifa-2024">Auracast</a>.</p><p>All you have to do is connect their headphones to your phone by scanning a QR code or with a single tap using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.android.com/better-together/">Google’s Fast Pair</a> —  without needing to hand over your earbud. It can pretty much transform your next hangout session with your friends into a private silent disco, without the hassle of looking for a speaker or having them open up the soundtrack on their devices. However, for this feature to work, both the phone and headphones must support LE Audio.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:54.83%;"><img id="txCoKE2uMdMTCBwCARX6ei" name="Audiorsharing-Auracast-LE-audio" alt="Android updates and feature drop this September" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/txCoKE2uMdMTCBwCARX6ei.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="658" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Furthermore, LE Audio Auracast will now become available for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8">Google Pixel 8</a> series and newer, Samsung flagship devices released since 2023, and some Xiaomi and POCO models.</p><h2 id="android-bot-that-looks-like-you-2">Android bot that looks like you</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IL6M7L4reSQ" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Imagine yourself as an Android bot in a superhero costume, or you'd simply like to turn a fun picture of yourself into one that features an Android bot that looks just like you! Google is finally bringing a tool called "Androidify" that will let you build your own Android bot.</p><p>All you have to do is upload a selfie onto the web or the Google Play app, write a prompt, add some accessories, and see what AI builds. The tool will then use "Gemini 2.5 Flash to caption the photo, Imagen to generate your custom Android bot, and (in some cases) Veo 3, Google’s latest video generation model, to animate your bot with different vibes.</p><p>This is definitely a cool tool to bring tap into the creative side of you, or probably experiment with your style as an Android bot. You can check out some inspiration from Google's own experiments with their mascot, like their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4E_oSld9ws">garage band</a> filming a music video or an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6nhmJ-o01Y">Oreo superhero</a> saving the world from an asteroid.</p><p>Additionally, Google notes that animating your Android bot into an 8-second video on Veo is a feature restricted to Fridays in September, with a limited number of creations available.</p><h2 id="ai-tools-keep-getting-better-2">AI tools keep getting better</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.39%;"><img id="Ss4xpBYdecmVCWtmrJEW77" name="Android-features-Sept-drop" alt="Android's Sept patch brings AI powered tools and more" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ss4xpBYdecmVCWtmrJEW77.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2096" height="1182" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Along with these major drops, Google is also making it easier to text with AI-powered suggestions on Gboard.
