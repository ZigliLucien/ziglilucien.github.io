                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The brand-new Oppo Find X8 series includes the Fitbit app in the pre-installed Google folder by default.</li><li>While most Android phones ship with a slew of pre-installed Android apps, this is the first time the Fitbit app has been included.</li><li>The presence of the Fitbit app on the Oppo Find X8 series could be a precursor to it being included on more Android phones in the future.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The Oppo Find X8 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Oppo Find X8 Pro</a> are now available globally, and we've reviewed the Find X8 Pro as one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> you can buy — if you're outside of North America. Aside from packing a great camera and impressive specs, the Oppo Find X8 series includes a new, pre-installed Google app for the first time: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit">Fitbit</a>.</p><p>The move, initially spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/11/21/fitbit-might-come-preloaded-on-your-next-android-phone/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, represents a first for an Android phone. On Find X8 phones, the Fitbit app is pre-installed and appears in the Google folder. Interestingly, the Fitbit app seemingly replaces the Google Fit app in this folder, since the latter isn't installed by default. While the company's own Google Pixel brand has included the Fitbit app on its phones, the Oppo Find X8 lineup represents the first time a partner OEM made the switch.</p>

<p>This comes as Google tries to streamline its fitness offerings. The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-redirects-fitbit-store-purchases">shut down the Fitbit web dashboard earlier this year</a>, but is simultaneously going all-in on the Fitbit app for mobile. In fact, Google Fit APIs are being discontinued, and Google is giving developers until June 30, 2025 to switch, according to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/health-and-fitness/guides/health-connect/migrate/migration-guide" target="_blank">support document</a>.</p><p>While most Android users in the U.S. probably aren't importing an Oppo Find X8 device, the inclusion of the Fitbit app could be a sign of what's to come stateside. Future phones from the likes of Samsung, Nothing, and OnePlus could similarly feature the pre-installed Fitbit app, taking the place of Google Fit. Although many users like Fitbit and the features it offers, some users are unsatisfied by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-design-fitbit-app-redesign">how it feels out of place</a> beside other stock Google apps, using its own color theme and ignoring system defaults.</p><p>"The Fitbit app has been available since earlier this year to Android OEMs as we continue to support the health and wellness of more consumers," a Google spokesperson said in a statement to Android Central. "Several device manufacturers have chosen to preload the app on their mobile devices."</p><p>This statement reveals that while Oppo is the first partner OEM to include Fitbit in its default apps package, other companies have had the opportunity to as well dating back to early 2024. Presumably, more brands will follow as Google Fit continues to give way for Fitbit as Android's top fitness service.</p><p><strong>Update (Nov. 21, 2:45 p.m. ET)</strong>: Added comment from Google spokesperson.</p>

<p>The Kiwi Design H4 is the company's brand new halo-style strap that is designed to take weight off your face with an easily adjustable strap that has ample padding for your forehead and the back of your head.</p><p>Better yet, it features quality batteries from Amprius Technologies in Fremont, California, including dual USB-PD charging tech that ensures your Meta Quest gets the correct voltage at all times and doesn't get overcharged. That battery not only adds hours of additional playtime but also helps better balance out the head strap for added comfort.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You like to play long VR sessions and need more comfort or longer battery life.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You only play for 30 minutes or so at a time or are already comfortable with the head strap you've got.</p>
<p>My previous favorite head strap was the BoboVR M3 Pro but Kiwi Design's strap adds tweaks the strap design in a way that's far more comfortable. Not only is it higher up and larger, but that forehead padding is adjustable via a handy dial in the front.</p><p>Kiwi also thought of plenty of other niceties like a rigid front connector — instead of the annoying cloth Velcro one most head straps use — as well as a battery that intelligently adjusts voltage to ensure your headset gets the right amount of power without that annoying hissing sound some batteries make.</p><p>While you're adding extra comfort to your Quest 3 or 3S, you should also grab a pair of Kiwi Design G4 Pro controller straps. They're <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/KIWI-design-Controller-Compatible-Accessories/dp/B0DFXW7JTN"><strong>20% off</strong></a> right now and are the most comfortable controller grips I've ever used.</p><p>They not only add important grip and padding to the Quest 3 or Quest 3S controllers — which are a little too compact for my liking — but the hand strap is a luxuriously soft cloth that feels similar to one of those extra-soft blankets you might have on your couch.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You tend to drop the Quest 3 or Quest 3S's controllers, or just find them uncomfortable/too small.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You use a dock to charge your controllers. Most grips aren't compatible with a dock.</p>
<p>These grips also have a convenient battery door on the side so you don't have to remove them just to swap out the controller battery every so often. If you haven't used controller grips yet, you're seriously not ready for how much better these make things. It's unreal!</p><p>Kiwi Design also has its V3 facial interface replacement on sale which is <em>a lot</em> more comfortable than the default facial interface shape and padding. This isn't just a silicone pad you put over top of the original facial interface, it's a full replacement that also adds ventilation to keep the Quest 3's lenses from fogging up during play.</p><p>Plus, it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/KIWI-design-Interface-Compatible-Accessories/dp/B0D48YLZJD"><strong>20% off</strong></a> right now during Kiwi Design's early Black Friday sale. The V3 <strong>ONLY</strong> works for the Meta Quest 3, though, so if you have a Quest 3S you'll want to grab the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/KIWI-design-Facial-Interface-Compatible/dp/B0DFXXW829/">Kiwi Design V4 facial interface</a>, instead.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>The default face pad isn't comfortable for any reason or your lenses get fogged up while playing.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You find PU leather uncomfortable.</p>
<p>The supple padding both wicks away sweat and is super easy to clean thanks to the PU leather material it's made of. The padding is easily removed and reinstalled via a Velcro backing, and most other face pads fit without issue. If you've already got some face pads lying around from other Quest headsets, they should work on this one.</p><p>Two pads come in the pack so it's easy to swap pads when you swap the headset, ensuring you're only sharing fun, not sweat.</p><p>Black Friday doesn't officially start until November 29, 2024, but there's no reason to wait until then to outfit your Quest 3 or Quest 3S with the best accessories. We don't ever see deals better than these, so you might as well jump on them now if you've been considering upgrading your headset this year.</p>

<hr>
<p>With Android 16's first preview in the wild, a recent discovery suggests a slight revamp for its eye-health-focused feature.</p><p>According to Mishaal Rahman (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-16-dp1-even-dimmer-3501674/">Android Authority</a>), Google has slightly reworked its lower brightness feature in the first Android 16 Developer Preview. Rahman states that "Extra Dim" has seemingly been reworked to "Even Dimmer" with the latest OS build. These features are reportedly the same; however, the latter has only surfaced on the Pixel 9.</p><p>Rahman states users must "manually" activate this "Even Dimmer" mode via the Accessibility page within Settings.</p><p>More importantly, the major change is that "Even Dimmer" will reportedly appear in Android's brightness bar. This likely means users can lower their brightness even further through the Quick Settings menu.</p><p>The post reiterates that this feature is essentially an "additional dimming layer." Discoveries show that Google intends users to utilize "Even Dimmer" in darker scenarios where you wouldn't want a blindingly bright display. It's worth mentioning that these lower brightness levels can only activate once the brightness bar is "at its lowest."</p><p>Elsewhere, Rahman discovered that Android 16 Developer Preview 1 teases an upcoming Quick Settings tile for "Even Dimmer." Rahman speculates that the setting in the Accessibility page will arrive <em>before </em>the tile.</p>

<p>Google's original plan, "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-beta-even-dimmer-setting-spotted">Extra Dim</a>," was discovered earlier this year during the Android 15 beta. Most of its functionality seems similar to what was seen during Beta 1. Moreover, the report stated that testers could find it within the Adaptive brightness toggle via the Display settings page. This made it so users were required to go in and set this mode every time they wanted a (much) lower brightness.</p><p>Now, with Google seemingly reworking it and placing it outside the settings, users can quickly toggle, slide the bar, and go. However, one concern is how such a vastly lower brightness setting could affect those with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM sensitivity</a>.</p><p>Google just dropped its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-developer-preview-1-is-here-with-new-features-and-a-snappier-release-timeline">Android 16 Developer Preview 1</a>, which is packed with several new features. This extremely early release signifies Google's earlier planned schedule for the release of Android 16. According to its timeline, the next major OS is planned for a Q2 2025 release. Elsewhere, it seems the software could include a new trick to calm down <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-has-a-new-trick-to-put-a-damper-on-annoying-app-pings">those annoying notifications</a>.</p><p>Android 16 could feature a "Notification Cooldown" feature that "softens" the volume/alert of notifications that constantly notify you.</p>

<p>We're about to get a new wave of flagship Android phones in 2025, and the Samsung Galaxy S25 series will most likely be the first major global launch. We should expect a trio of new models like the last few years, which means many would be contemplating an upgrade. Samsung will be pushing its hero model front and center — the Galaxy S25 Ultra — which is slated to come with a host of upgrades.</p><p>All those who skipped the S24 Ultra would be looking at the new model as a potential candidate. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> is another strong smartphone worth looking at.

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> is rumored to have a slight design change, and this render (above) gives us a good idea of what it could look like. That, and our first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-should-you-wait" target="_blank">S25 Ultra case</a> that we've received from Fibreborne, points to the phone having flat sides and rounded corners. This puts it more in line with the rest of the series, but the edges of the Ultra would have a lesser curve than the S25 and S25 Plus. Some of the leaked dimensions point to the phone <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-thinnest-lightest-model-rumor">being lighter</a> and slimmer than its predecessor, which means it could be lighter than even the Pixel 9 Pro XL.</p><p>The main silhouette of the Galaxy S25 Ultra should be similar to the S24 Ultra, with a similar layout for the ports and buttons. Even the camera layout seems to be nearly identical, based on the leaked renders and the cases we received. While the flat sides and lighter design should make it easier to hold, it's still going to be a massive phone. Other design staples should also be in place, such as the IP68 waterproofing, the S Pen stylus, and the USB-C 3.2 port.</p><p>We should also expect <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-color-options-tipped">similar colors for the S25 Ultra</a> as we have for the current-gen phone. Samsung.com should have some exclusive shades, which would vary depending on the region.</p>

<p>The Pixel 9 Pro XL adopted a new design language with glossy, flat sides and a more pronounced camera bar on the back. This very iPhone Pro-like aesthetic actually looks very flattering, and the new colours it comes in really helps it stand out. The 9 Pro XL is relatively slim at 8.5mm in thickness, but it is on the heavier side at 221g. Thankfully, the edges don't really dig into your palm to make it uncomfortable.</p><p>The Pixel 9 Pro XL is the larger variant of the 9 Pro, and is the direct replacement for the Pixel 8 Pro even though the nomenclature is a bit different this time around. You get IP68 dust and waterproofing, Gorilla Glass Victus 2 scratch protection over the display, and eSIM support.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GGAfLvqLid7eLG5D28wsYk" name="galaxy-s24-ultra-dead-to-me.png" alt="Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra with Battery Dying wallpaper" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GGAfLvqLid7eLG5D28wsYk.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We don't have a lot of information about the S25 Ultra's display yet, other than the fact that the corners will be more curved than the current model. Everything points to it being the same 6.8-inch size with a QHD+ resolution, LTPO 120Hz refresh rate, and support for HDR playback. We could see an improved Corning Gorilla Armor scratch protection, higher peak brightness, and a better anti-reflective coating. One trick that it will continue to have is support for the S Pen stylus with over 4,000 levels of pressure sensitivity.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Pixel 9 Pro XL features Google's Super Actua display panel of the same 6.8-inch size and a resolution of 2,992x1,344 pixels. This LTPO panel also has a higher peak brightness than the current S24 Ultra of 3,000 nits, along with a 120Hz variable refresh rate. The biggest issue still plaguing Pixel phones is the abysmal 240Hz PWM dimming rate which it uses across the brightness spectrum. This can cause severe headaches for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">people that are sensitive</a> to this, and can end up being a deal-breaker.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JSWpEtXtpmh2kSKikBmvB" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-purple-03.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra cameras" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JSWpEtXtpmh2kSKikBmvB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p>We might not have the official price for the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra yet, but based on Samsung's track record for this year alone, it'll most likely be $100 more than the S24 Ultra's pricing. The latter officially starts at $1,299.99 (less during <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/live/black-friday-samsung-deals-2024">Black Friday deals</a>), which means the S25 Ultra will be either the same or more. You should expect the same storage variants starting with 256GB. RAM should also be 12GB, but this could be spec'ed higher up to 16GB in order to run newer Galaxy AI features. The phone will also most likely sport the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> SoC, which is said to bring laptop-class CPU performance to smartphones.</p><p>The Google Pixel 9 Pro XL cannot hope to compete with the raw processing power of the S25 Ultra, as its Tensor G4 SoC simply isn't built for it. Google has made big improvements to thermal efficiency and AI performance with this generation, compared to the previous one. In our review, we noticed that while the SoC still throttles when playing demanding games, it doesn't get as hot, so it takes longer for the phone to reach its thermal threshold.</p><p>Pricing is slightly better for the Pixel. While most should skip past the entry 128GB model, the 256GB variant costs $1,199, 512GB is $1,319, and the 1TB variant is $1,549. This is, of course, before you apply any coupons or discounts from retailers, which there most certainly will be. Unless you pre-order the S25 Ultra, this phone is unlikely to see any sort of discount for at least a few months after launch.</p><p>You can take a look at all the differences in specs in the table below.</p>

<p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-and-s25-plus-rumored-to-use-sony-sensors">rumor</a> from December 2023 suggested that Samsung will switch to all Sony sensors for the S25 and S25 Plus models, but the Ultra might continue using Samsung's ISOCELL sensors. Samsung already rejigged the telephoto cameras on the S24 Ultra this year, dropping the magnification of the 10x module to 5x but, in turn, using a higher resolution sensor. It's high time we got better ultrawide and selfie cameras for the Ultra, and our hope is that they change with the S25 Ultra. In terms of capabilities, the S24 Ultra can already record 8K videos and capture HDR videos, so our guess is that we could see some new AI-based capture modes like the Pixel.</p><p>The Pixel 9 Pro XL passed our camera tests with flying colors, delivering excellent details, colors, and white balance. It's also very effective for capturing subjects in motion, like pets or toddlers. Whether it's low-light or day-light, the 9 Pro XL's cameras are up to the job and almost never disappoint. Exclusive AI features like Add Me take the photography experience a step further.</p>

<p>The Galaxy S25 Ultra is rumored to have the same battery capacity as the S24 Ultra, which is not a bad thing. The 5,000mAh capacity delivered multiple-day battery life on the S24 Ultra, so I would imagine with the newer chip and other software optimizations, the S25 Ultra should do just as well, if not better. Samsung hasn't budged from the 45W wired charging for many years, and it doesn't seem like it will anytime soon.</p><p>The Pixel 9 Pro XL has impressive battery life, often stretching well beyond a full day, even with heavy use. According to our parent company's lab test results, the 9 Pro XL took an average of 13 hours to drain its battery completely, compared to the nine hours it took for the 8 Pro. Considering it has nearly the same capacity as the 8 Pro, the power efficiency of the new Tensor G4 really shines here. Charging speed has gotten better, but only for the 0-30 minute dash and when using Google's 45W charger.</p>

<p>One of the big talking points of the Galaxy S25 Ultra is going to be the software. It's slated to run <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsungs-android-15-update-gets-an-up-close-reveal-in-this-one-ui-7-hands-on-video">One UI 7</a>, which is supposed to be massively overhauled, based on what we've seen so far. Samsung should be releasing a beta for it before the year ends, but you should expect a new look for the notification shade and toggle buttons, new icons and UI elements, and most importantly, more AI integration in the form of notifications summaries and more.</p><p>Samsung should also be finally implementing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-seamless-update-support-rumor">Google's seamless update</a> tech for smoother update installations. You can expect a lot of talk about new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> features which should be even more tightly integrated within the UI, along with new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> features. The S25 Ultra should also be getting seven years of OS and security updates. Keep in mind that One UI 7 will eventually come to the S24 Ultra, but it's possible some features will be kept exclusive for the S25 series.</p><p>The Pixel 9 Pro XL launched with Android 14 but was one of the first phones to get the Android 15 update. Google will also be supporting this phone for the next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-9-software-updates">seven years</a> in terms of software updates. Google's AI features in the 9 Pro XL are nothing short of amazing. The Reimagine tool especially is incredibly fun to play with as it lets you modify the environment around your subject in a very realistic manner.</p>

<p>If you are a current Samsung user still holding on to the S23 Ultra, then the S25 Ultra should be a good upgrade. Be prepared to shell out a hefty premium though, which I'm guessing you probably won't mind having skipped a generation. The Galaxy S25 Ultra will no doubt be yet another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phone</a> in 2025 as it's a proper all-rounder tackling photography, productivity, and gaming, in a single device.</p><p>For the majority of users who don't care about the S Pen or need a gaming smartphone, the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL will serve you a lot better. The cameras are simply amazing, the design is unique, battery life is stellar, and it has some of the best software in the Android space. Prices of all the variants should be a lot more competitive as well, compared to the S25 Ultra.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google is adding a new Android feature that will keep your apps signed in after restoring from a backup or switching to a new device, it announced in a post on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2024/11/maintain-strong-user-relationships-with-restore-credentials.html"> Android Developers Blog </a>. It's called Restore Credentials, and it's built right into the existing Credential Manager API. Best of all, it requires no manual action from the user, as it is handled on the app and Android side automatically.</p><p>Here's how it works. When a user signs into their app account on an Android phone, app developers can create a restore key for the user. It's saved locally, and can be uploaded to the cloud if the user has agreed to back up the app's data. Then, when a user <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-transfer-data-your-old-android-phone-your-new-phone">starts restoring from a backup</a> on a new device, the app's data and its restore key are transferred. The app can be signed into the app, without the Android user even needing to open it. In other words, your phone <em>should</em> be just how you left it.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/everything-ios-18-stole-from-android">Similarly to the iOS feature</a>, it's likely that not all apps will automatically retain their sign-in status after restoring from a backup. Developers will need to add the new functionality in the Credential Manager API to their app, which may take some time. Google explains how to do this in its post, and recommends developers delete restore keys after a user manually signs out of an app.</p>

<p>Restore Credentials are based on Google's existing implementation of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/upgrade-to-passkeys-on-pixel-with-google-password-manager">passkeys</a>, and incorporate standards from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/" target="_blank">FIDO Alliance</a>.</p><p>All this happens during the backup and restore process, with the idea being that you should be automatically signed into your apps after the restore process is completed. Google says that the introduction of Restore Credentials should make it easier to switch between Android phones, regardless of manufacturer. It claims that 40% of U.S. users reset or replace their phones each year, so eliminating friction in the restore process is crucial.</p><p>Being that Restore Credentials mimics a fan-favorite iOS feature, it's likely that Android users will appreciate this new functionality the next time they reset their device, or switch to a new one.</p>

<ul><li>Galaxy S25 "Slim" rumors surface, stating the device will still feature three cameras despite its thinner profile.</li><li>The device will allegedly receive a 200MP primary lens, a 50MP ultrawide camera, and a 50MP telephoto lens with 3.5x zoom.</li><li>Rumors adds that the device could leverage Samsung's new ALoP tech to deliver strong cameras in a thin frame.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Rumors continue to pile up about Samsung's potential S25 series addition as its supposed camera strength surfaces.</p><p>According to a post, X tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/saaaanjjjuuu/status/1858733585466855562">Sanju Choudhary</a> claims the supposed "Galaxy S25 Slim" will debut with a flagship-level camera (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2024/11/samsung-galaxy-s25-slim-camera-details-seemingly-revealed.html">Android Headlines</a>). Per the report, the thinner S25 will supposedly feature a 200MP Isocell HP5 primary camera. The tipster adds the lens will likely feature a "1/1.56-inch" sensor.</p><p>Despite its thinner form, Samsung is rumored to continue the three-lens trend on the back of the S25 Slim. The tipster claims the phone will feature an ultrawide lens paired with an assumed telephoto camera. Regarding the former, the post states it could arrive with a 1/2.76-inch sensor with 50MP strength within the Isocell JN5 series.</p><p>Additionally, the telephoto lens is reportedly entering at 50MP with the same sensor size as the JN5 series and 3.5x zoom capabilities.</p>

<p>Additional (rumored) details about the Galaxy S25 Slim's cameras sort of double down on what <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-galaxy-s25-slim-could-pack-a-serious-camera-punch-despite-its-thin-profile">we heard earlier in November</a>. The device was originally theorized to debut with an "Ultra" camera, pushing speculation to believe a 200MP camera was involved. The latest rumor doubles down on that and expands on what was missing: auxiliary lenses. It was uncertain if the Slim variant could even support two extra lenses due to its thinner frame; however, the tipster claims Samsung could leverage new tech.</p><p>The post on X states the Korean OEM could work in a strong ultrawide and telephoto lens thanks to its new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-telephoto-camera-module-alop-detailed">ALoP camera technology</a>.</p><p>Samsung recently detailed ALoP (All Lenses on Prism) tech, which places the camera's lenses "horizontally upon the prism, remaining in the plane of the smartphone body." In short, the company appeared confident that its new tech could deliver what consumers want (strong cameras) while retaining a sleek and thin phone. It wasn't clear where Samsung could show off this tech, but recent rumors push us toward the "Galaxy S25 Slim."</p><p>In other news, a recent database discovery might prove that the Slim model exists. Model number SM-S937U was found in the GSMA IMEI database. A report claims it resembles the S25 series' SM-S937 model number, which could mean the Slim exists. We're likely a few months from a launch as the device is rumored to debut in Q2 2025.</p>

<ul><li>Rumors have surfaced, claiming Google has cancelled a future Pixel Tablet with the codename "Kiyomi."</li><li>Reports conflict as one claims this device is the Pixel Table 3 while another can allegedly "confirm" it's the Pixel Tablet 2 that's been abandoned.</li><li>The rumors are strange considering reports have surfaced about a supposed keyboard accessory for the Tablet 2 and more computer power for the Tablet 3.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Strange rumors have surfaced, suggesting Google has already dropped the idea of a future tablet release.</p><p>The rumors stem from a report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/exclusive-google-cancels-pixel-tablet-3-development">Android Headlines</a>, which claims Google has abandoned the idea of a "Pixel Tablet 3." The publication claims that the company "made the decision last week" to discard project "Kiyomi."</p><p>Supposed sources close to the matter "confirmed" that Google has reassigned the Pixel Tablet 3 team to other areas within the company.</p><p>Strangely, a more recent report by Mishaal Rahman (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-tablet-2-canceled-3502094/">Android Authority</a>) states Google might have actually canceled its Pixel Tablet 2. Rahman's alleged evidence is that the rumored "Kiyomi" codename belongs to the second-gen tablet, not the future third-gen. Moreover, it seems that Google was in the beginning stages of the Pixel Tablet 2 with only whispers and ideas for a Tablet 3, which hadn't yet started its development cycle.</p><p>Rumors claim Google was working to bring Wi-Fi and 5G connectivity to the Kiyomi-codenamed Pixel Tablet 2. Additionally, Rahman reiterates previous findings that suggest Kiyomi would've debuted with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> while the Pixel Tablet 3 would (likely) have the G6. More importantly, Rahman claims Google is moving away from a Tablet 2 over concerns that it won't "sell very well."</p><p>With rumors surfacing from two different areas, it's wise to take what's been said with caution. Android Central has reached out to Google for more information about this future Pixel Tablet cancellation. We will update this article when we hear back.</p><p>What's more, Rahman states a "Pixel Tablet 3" could still happen in some capacity. It remains to be seen what name it arrives with and what goodies it could bring.</p>

<p>Cancellation rumors about either device are strange, especially considering rumors of progress <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-2-accessory-prototype-rumors">surfaced about them recently</a>. The Pixel Tablet 2 was reportedly entering its prototyping stage with a valuable accessory: a keyboard. The accessory was rumored to arrive as a "keyboard cover," meaning it would keep the tablet's display safe when transporting and used to prop it up when typing.</p><p>Elsewhere, rumors claimed the Pixel Tablet 2's design was similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">the original device</a> from 2023.</p><p>Speculation about a potential Pixel Tablet 3 claimed Google was giving it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/pixel-tablet-3-second-usb-c-port-desktop-rumor">more computer-like power</a>. The company was allegedly looking ahead to the tablet to provide it with a second USB-C port. The report stated the port would support DisplayPort output with the USB 3.2 standard. With such support, the Pixel Tablet 3 would support an additional external display, making it easy for users to get some work done as if they were on a laptop.</p><p>However, with the way rumors are flying right now, it's hard to know which way Google is going until it states officially.</p>

All we had seen up to that point were games where stuff would come out of the walls so you could shoot or grab them. In other words, similar ideas to early VR titles that were fun for 20-30 minutes but lacked any real lasting value.</p>

<p>One year later, the brilliant developers in the Meta Quest ecosystem have proven me <em>very</em> wrong, with three new games proving that mixed reality <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/the-quest-3s-mixed-reality-isnt-just-the-gimmick-you-think-it-is">is more than just a gimmick</a>. I first saw how mixed reality games could change the landscape <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/mixed-reality-games-getting-good">in February</a>, and these latest releases have completely changed my expectations going forward.</p><p>Of course, this has been building throughout the year. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/homeworld-vast-reaches-arrives-on-meta-quest">Homeworld Vast Reaches</a> debuted with a way to play the entire strategy game in mixed reality, while titles like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/starship-home-mixed-reality-game-impressions">Starship Home</a> only exist in mixed reality by transforming your four falls into a spaceship.</p><p>Now, The Last Stand, Spatial Ops, and Wall Town Wonders are taking the concept even further in ways that totally blew me away, once again adding more games to the never-ending list of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">must-play Meta Quest 3 games</a>.</p>

<h2 id="turning-your-home-into-a-laser-tag-arena-2">Turning your home into a laser tag arena</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SkTh4kn7FsA" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Spatial Ops is the latest title from Resolution Games, the folks behind Angry Birds VR, Demeo, Racket Club, and several other VR classics. The company is no stranger to mixed reality but this is the first mixed-reality-only game they've built for the Meta Quest platform.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>My family and I had a blast playing the arena mode in the house on a Saturday morning.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Spatial Ops' biggest claim to fame is its ability to turn any large space into a "laser tag arena," for lack of a better term. You set up barriers, weapon spawning locations, and even flags to capture. Arenas can be any size you want, but the bigger the arena, the better your experience will be.</p><p>My home isn't particularly large — it's about 1,000 square feet — and the layout isn't particularly helpful for an arena-style game, but my family and I still had a blast playing the arena mode on a Saturday morning with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s">Meta Quest 3S</a>, Quest 3, and even a Quest 2.</p><p>Running around the house blasting each other and picking up power-ups was great family fun, and, like I said previously, a bigger space would be even better for the formula. I found that Capture the Flag or Point Capture works best for smaller spaces as you can defend a small space effectively, while a free-for-all match mostly feels like chaos.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Spatial Ops' single-player campaign feels like a true next-generation Time Crisis light gun game from the glory days of 2000s arcades.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>And while the arena mode might be the glitzy mode that gives content creators millions of views, it's the single-player campaign mode that will bring players in for the long haul. In essence, Spatial Ops' single-player campaign feels like a true next-generation Time Crisis light gun game from the glory days of 2000s arcades.</p><p>We've got plenty of light gun games these days, but Spatial Ops sets itself apart by using portals to bring the action to your room in a unique way. Not only do these portals have a unique effect that made me hone my focus on them, but they also appear on any of the four walls in your room as well as on the ceiling.</p><p>This true 360-degree gameplay felt downright incredible, and I found myself smiling constantly during every minute of gameplay. It's got seven chapters in total, each of which will take 20-30 minutes to complete, making it a respectable length without feeling long in the tooth.</p>

<h2 id="a-living-christmas-village-on-your-walls-2">A living Christmas village on your walls</h2>

<p>Wall Town Wonders isn't a "Christmas-themed" game — although I fully expect this to be one of the first promised seasonal updates — but it certainly does feel like a Christmas village that came to life. The best part is that you won't need to install any shelves since all the buildings sit on the wall all by themselves.</p><p>In Wall Town Wonders, you'll be managing a tiny village that resides on the walls of your room. As you'd expect from a village management game, things are a bit more interactive/intimate than you'd expect from a city builder.</p><p>While there's no direct control over the denizens of your town as is the case in a game like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/townsmen-vr-meta-quest-3-exclusive">Townsmen VR</a> — meaning you can't pick them up and place them anywhere at any time — there are times when a character will hop on your controller so you can bring them somewhere as part of the game's story.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zjtpVr74wMWW9eHRQ27FJ6" name="wall-town-wonders-quest-3s-official-screenshot-town" alt="An official screenshot of a wall full of buildings in Wall Town Wonders on a Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zjtpVr74wMWW9eHRQ27FJ6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Cyborn)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You'll also be directly controlling characters flying planes, riding on the back of miniature (yet giant) lizards, and even combing through mines to dig up ore and other resources. The town simulation isn't relegated to just putting up buildings by any means; your direct input is what will make your town truly thrive.</p><p>Some buildings will automatically bring in resources — the restaurant and some shops bring in gold, while smiths and other crafters will bring in their respective resources — but many important resources are gathered through mini-games that you directly control, as well.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>I found myself marveling at the miniature lives of the folks who frequented my town, getting up close and personal to see what they were up to when walking in and out of rooms that exist somewhere behind the drywall.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>After a little while, you'll build a tropical pond on your floor, which houses diving contests and fishing tournaments, all of which you'll play from a giant's perspective. Berry hunting with the ridable lizards sees the little green guys crawling on your walls while tending to the town's garden, which sometimes involves shooting bugs that crawl out of imaginary holes in those same walls.</p><p>It's all very fun and imaginative and marks one of the most charming times I've yet experienced in any VR or mixed-reality game. I found myself marveling at the miniature lives of the folks who frequented my town, getting up close and personal to see what they were up to when walking in and out of rooms that existed somewhere behind the drywall.</p><p>Not only is the placement of objects super convincing but there's even a way to adjust the lighting to better match your room if you're really a stickler for realism. Plus, controller and hand-tracking support means you can play this as casually as you want, although I generally found that I preferred controller support for some mini-games.</p>

<h2 id="not-just-another-zombie-shooter-in-a-mall-2">Not just another zombie shooter in a mall</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/36VKeCiTA64" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>The Last Stand is the...ahem...last game I'll cover today, and I'll keep it mostly brief. That's not because I didn't like it at all — quite the contrary. It's because the game just launched in early access and is best when played in half-hour bouts.</p><p>This one is made by the folks behind <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/drop-dead-the-cabin-hands-on-synthwave-zombies-are-more-fun-with-a-friend">Drop Dead: The Cabin</a> and the accompanying Home Invasion mixed reality mode. If anything, The Last Stand feels like the full version of what the team was trying to do with Home Invasion, as the game turns your room into a mall store that you'll need to defend.</p><p>The twist is that another human player is on the other side of the mall, and only one person can walk away with the title "survivor."</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Your real furniture can be used to duck behind and protect yourself from virtual gun fire, and that was just super trippy to me.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Developer Soul Assembly is currently developing a proper progression game mode, but for now, you can still enjoy defending your store and keeping at the top of the leaderboards, playing rounds with friends or random folks alike.</p><p>The concept alone is interesting enough, but I was impressed by how large my tiny 10ftx10ft guest bedroom felt once The Last Stand attached doorways and windows to the walls. People often add ceiling-to-floor mirrors to make rooms feel larger than they are, but this is a next-level room makeover — well, except for the boarded-up windows and invading zombies, of course.</p><p>Looking out at a mall-sized room outside my own room was simply surreal, but taking in the sights doesn't last long as the other player will be shooting at you all while zombies try to consume your brains. Zombie kills equate to cash earned, and the handy tablet you have on your back gets you a quick way to buy better gear and weapons to progress faster.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="o6bVHwmujBipQkokqgdCAV" name="the-last-stand-official-screenshot-01" alt="An official screenshot of The Last Stand on a Meta Quest 3 showing a player attacking another player from across the mall" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o6bVHwmujBipQkokqgdCAV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Soul Assembly)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I also loved being able to designate one wall as the "main" wall, which would completely change the look and feel of the room. Soul Assembly says that rooms with more furniture in them are best for this game and that immediately made sense when I picked a wall with no furniture against it. Your <em>real furniture</em> can be used to duck behind and protect yourself from virtual gunfire, and that was just super trippy to me.</p><p>I'm really looking forward to seeing proper character progression and some other features built out for this one over time. It's only a few bucks, though, which makes it easy to pick up without feeling like you got ripped off.</p>

<p>These three games are just a few examples of how good mixed reality gameplay has gotten, and this is just the tip of the iceberg. Many more mixed reality games are coming out before the end of the year, and I expect this class of games will only continue to grow as developers learn how to transform your physical space into new, fun games.</p><p>The best part is that you don't even need the most expensive headset for this since the Meta Quest 3S delivers full-quality mixed-reality gameplay for only $299.</p>

Multiple reports from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/YoutubeMusic/comments/1gvhrim/my_ui_is_buggy/?utm_source=embedv2&utm_medium=post_embed&utm_content=post_body&embed_host_url=https://9to5google.com/2024/11/20/youtube-music-now-playing-controls/" target="_blank">Reddit users</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/11/20/youtube-music-now-playing-controls/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a> indicated that YouTube Music's Now Playing page was testing a significant shakeup, with buttons moving around and a new-look scrubber. Android Central can confirm the test firsthand, as the redesigned Now Playing screen has appeared on at least one of our devices.</p><p>Previously, the actions carousel appeared directly under the song title, artist, and album artwork. This carousel gives users access to buttons for like, dislike, comments, sharing and more. However, the new test moves the main playback controls — including play/pause, forward/rewind, and shuffle/loop — directly under the song title and artist name.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:313px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:244.41%;"><img id="QBbUtybK7QN5gBSqBQLN66" name="YouTube-Music-Controls-Test" alt="The new layout for controls in YouTube Music." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QBbUtybK7QN5gBSqBQLN66.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="313" height="765" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The test moves those crucial Now Playing buttons closer to the center of the screen, and the song details. It also shifts them further away from the bottom of the screen, which may cause reachability issues when using your phone one-handed. This is a unique problem for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music">YouTube Music</a>, because it has the actions carousel that forces the main Now Playing buttons upward or downward on the screen. Other streaming apps, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/spotify">Spotify</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/apple-music-youtube-music-playlist-transfer">Apple Music</a>, don't have this problem because they don't have an actions carousel or equivalent.</p><p>Additionally, the timeline is redesigned, taking cues from the main YouTube app. It's now a rectangle without a visible dot for the scrubber. Instead, the scrubber will appear if you try and hold and drag along the timeline to skip or go back. It's a more minimalist design that will feel familiar if you're used to other Google timeline scrubbers.</p><p>Of course, since the Now Playing buttons are moved up, the actions carousel must be moved down. It's now in between the up next/lyrics/related buttons at the very bottom of the screen and the main Now Playing buttons.</p><p>While these changes may take some getting used to, it has been a while since YouTube Music updated its Now Playing screen, so maybe it was time for a tweak or two. This seems to be a somewhat limited test for now, and we're not sure when it might roll out to all YouTube Music users. You might have to wait and hope you get lucky, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-music-recap-2024-arrives-early">those YouTube Music users who got their Rewind stats early</a>.</p>

<p>Google has hit back at the U.S. Department of Justice, accusing it of pushing a "radical interventionist agenda" to break its search business.</p><p>According to a report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apnews.com/article/google-search-monopoly-penalty-justice-department-84e07fec51c5c59751d846118cb900a7" target="_blank">Associated Press</a>, the DOJ has made it official—<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-could-be-forced-to-sell-off-chrome-to-level-the-search-playing-field">it’s coming for Google’s search monopoly</a>. After Judge Amit Mehta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/justice-department-vs-google-ruling-search-dominance">ruled against the tech giant</a>, the DOJ issued a 23-page proposal detailing its plan to force Google to part ways with Chrome and tighten the reins on Android.</p><p>Back in August, a U.S. court called out Alphabet for throwing billions at Samsung and Apple to keep Google as the default search engine. Judge Mehta ruled the tactic straight-up broke antitrust laws.</p><p>The DOJ argues that cutting Chrome loose would strip Google of a key internet gateway, giving rival search engines a fair shot to compete.</p><p>Alphabet isn’t backing down from what it calls the DOJ’s “extreme" proposal. Kent Walker, Google’s global affairs chief, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/doj-search-remedies-nov-2024/" target="_blank">argued</a> that splitting off Chrome and Android could hurt user security, privacy, and the overall quality of their products.</p><p>Walker raised concerns that the DOJ’s plan might force Google to share sensitive info—like proprietary tech and even personal search queries from millions of Americans—with unknown entities at home and abroad.</p><p>He also slammed the DOJ’s proposal for adding extra steps for Pixel users, requiring two separate choice screens just to get to Google Search.</p><p>Walker also warned that the DOJ’s plan could leak trade secrets to foreign companies, slow down AI progress, and have major negative effects on the global tech landscape.</p><p>The DOJ’s proposal goes way beyond what the court decided, targeting not just Google Search but a whole range of beloved Google products used around the globe, Walker wrote.</p><p>The DOJ has been taking aim at Alphabet’s habit of pre-installing Google products on Android, suggesting both "behavioral and structural fixes" to stop Google from using its power in Chrome, the Play Store, and Android to unfairly push Google Search.</p>
