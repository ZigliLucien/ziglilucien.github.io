<ul><li>Garmin has launched the Instinct 3 Solar and Instinct 3 AMOLED, both in 45mm and 50mm case sizes.</li><li>The Instinct 3 Solar is even more long-lived than its predecessor but keeps its monochrome, low-resolution display.</li><li>The Instinct 3 AMOLED is more expensive and shorter-lived with no solar recharge, but can display much more information.</li><li>New features include a built-in flashlight, multi-band GPS, sleep coaching, and enhanced safety features.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>After months of leaks, the Garmin Instinct 3 has made its expected arrival at CES 2025. It ships in 45mm and 50mm cases, each size available in both AMOLED and MIP Solar with a built-in flashlight.</p><p>The series' trademark epic battery life returns, but only the Solar version has "unlimited" daily battery life (with several hours of sunlight per day), up to 260 GPS hours, or up to 60 multi-band GPS hours.</p><p>Even without the solar boost, the Instinct 3 Solar beats the Instinct 3 AMOLED for daily battery (40 vs. 24 days), GPS (60 vs. 40 hours), and multi-band GPS (34 vs. 30 hours). But this Solar version has the same 176 x 176 resolution and infamous two-windowed, monochrome MIP as the Instinct 2 — though the display is slightly larger at 1.1 inches.</p><p>That's why many will jump to the AMOLED version for a 1.2-inch (390 x 390) or 1.3-inch (416 x 416) display, accepting the battery trade-off. Otherwise, you'll need to switch to the 90-day <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-launches-new-fenix-8-and-enduro-3">Garmin Enduro 3</a> for a full-resolution MIP display, and that costs $400 more.</p><p>Whether you choose the MIP or AMOLED display, Garmin gave all Instinct 3 models a built-in LED flashlight taken from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-2x-solar-review">Instinct 2X Solar</a>. So you'll be able to illuminate your path (at the significant cost of battery life).</p><p>Other series similarities persist, such as 10ATM water resistance, MIL-STD-810 thermal and shock resistance, training readiness, daily suggested workouts, and post-workout recovery time data. But the Instinct 3 <em>looks</em> slightly better because Garmin mixed some aluminum into the polymer bezel for a little facelift.</p><p>The Garmin Instinct 3 Solar costs $399 (45mm) or $449 (50mm), while the Instinct 3 AMOLED costs $449 (45mm) or $499 (50mm); these prices generally match what the last generation cost prior to price drops. All versions have a Black case with Black or Charcoal bands, but Garmin is selling "Limited Edition" versions of the AMOLED in Neo Tropic green or the Solar in Twilight blue that may sell out quickly.</p><p>Beyond the Instinct 3, Garmin has announced several other products at CES 2025, including a new HRM 200 and a Zumo R1 Motorcycle Radar. Plus, it won a "2025 CES Best of Innovation" award for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-inreach-messenger-plus-announced">InReach Messenger Plus</a>, which it announced last year.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2AiAyA3QtfckEyWjzSQrCN" name="Garmin-Instinct-3-Solar-press-photo" alt="A photo of the Garmin Instinct 3 Solar on a man's wrist as he looks down at the main watch face" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2AiAyA3QtfckEyWjzSQrCN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you're considering a switch from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-2-solar-review">Garmin Instinct 2 Solar</a> to the Instinct 3, you'll find a decent selection of new software features. You'll get advanced sleep coaching with nap detection, plus relaxation reminders and meditation guidance. You add a gyroscope for more accurate wrist tracking, plus (with AMOLED) on-screen workout animations and muscle maps.</p><p>For runners, you'll see new widgets for training load focus, load ratio, and upcoming races, as well as multisport auto transition, grade-adjusted pace, and wrist-based running dynamics. And you'll get more accurate location tracking, thanks to multi-band GPS and the dynamic SatIQ tool for swapping to better accuracy when needed.</p><p>Plus, you'll get dozens of new sports modes: Jump Rope, Indoor Walking, Virtual Running, Obstacle Racing, Golfing, Disc Golf, Archery, BMX, Boating, Water Skiing, Snorkeling, Wakeboarding, Wakesurfing, Tubing, Whitewater, Motorcycling, Overlanding, Motocrossing, ATVing, Snowmobiling, Pickleball, Badminton, Squash, Table Tennis, Padel, Platform Tennis, Racquetball, XC Skate Skiing, Ice Skating, Basketball, Volleyball, Field Hockey, Ice Hockey, Football/Soccer, American Football, Lacrosse, Rugby, Ultimate Disc, Cricket, Softball, Baseball, Boxing, Mixed Martial Arts, Jumpmaster, and Inline Skating.</p><p>As for other changes, the Instinct 3 adds an on-device Connect IQ store, Garmin Messenger app compatibility, Stocks and Tides views, live event sharing, incident detection reports, and advanced cycling dynamics.</p><p>In terms of battery life, the Garmin Instinct 3 45mm matches the Instinct 2 Solar 45mm with a 28-day baseline and "unlimited" with solar, but its solar panel is significantly more efficient, with 130 GPS hours compared to the Instinct 2 Solar's 48 hours. If you choose the Instinct 3 Solar 50mm, you'll get 40 days and 260 GPS hours, with the same 1.1-inch display and only 6g extra weight.</p><p>When the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-3-leaks-im-hoping-for-two-major-changes">Instinct 3 first leaked in November</a>, I predicted the AMOLED transition, but I also made other requests: abandoning the two-windowed design, adding music storage, switching to the Elevate v5 for ECGs and skin temp readings, and finally bringing back LTE support. Unfortunately, none of those requests came true.</p><p>My first impression is that this Instinct 3 update will make AMOLED users happy, but may feel a bit safe for fans of MIP displays who'd hoped to see a full-res, colorful display along with long battery life. Yes, the Instinct 3 Solar lasts much longer, but I'm sure many users would've loved a visual middle ground that gave them colorful watch faces <em>and</em> solar charging.</p><p>Still, I like Garmin's dual MIP/AMOLED approach with new models like the Instinct 3 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Fenix 8</a>. It lets consumers decide whether they want to prioritize indoor or outdoor visibility or extra battery life over casual visual upgrades.</p>

                    <p><p><em><strong>Long-lived and rugged</strong></em></p><p>The Garmin Instinct 3 is the brand's latest smartwatch to transition to AMOLED, but MIP fans can stick with a lower-res option for "unlimited" battery life. The Instinct 3 is as rugged and distinct as ever, but somewhat lighter than it looks thanks to its polymer materials. It has all the training insights and sports modes that any outdoorsy types could ever want.</p></p>

<p>This Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus vs. Galaxy S24 Plus speculative comparison will be fun. We will look back on the specs for the S24 Plus, compare them with the rumored specs for the upcoming Galaxy S25 Plus, and get an idea if it's worth upgrading. We don't have the official specs for the upcoming model, but that won't stop us from comparing them and seeing how different or similar they might be, according to the rumors.</p><p>The S25 Plus will likely launch with many new features and upgrades, while some things may stay the same. It will feature One UI 7 and all its goodies, such as writing assist tools that boost productivity and help you organize your notes in various ways. You can also select text and fix it without opening another app. Let's see what else the upcoming S25 Plus may offer against its predecessor.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-plus-hands-on-images-leaked" target="_blank">Leaked hands-on images</a> show that the Galaxy S25 Plus could have the same triple camera setup seen in previous Galaxy models but with a style possibly inspired by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review" target="_blank">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>. You could see thin bezels around the outer perimeter of the rounded corner design and an LED flash to the right.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 Plus could go through a slight design change around the corners compared to its soon-to-be predecessor. This includes black rings surrounding the lenses, while the rest of the back panel remains simple.</p><p>The colors for the Galaxy S25 Plus have leaked unusually, with a parts dealer claiming to have replaced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-s25-plus-colors-seemingly-confirmed-as-sim-card-trays-leak" target="_blank">SIM card trays that match the phone's color</a>. Apparently, the upcoming Samsung might come in possible colors such as Moon Night Blue, Midnight Black, Silver Shadow, Sparkling Green, and Blue.</p><p>Samsung-exclusive colors are also available when you buy the phone from its online store. According to a leak last month, there could be three colors: Pink Gold, Coral Red, and Blue/Black.</p><p>While we haven't encountered rumors about the Galaxy S25 Plus's IP rating, we expect it to be the same IP68 rating as the soon-to-be-previous model. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-leaked-renders-reveal-flat-design" target="_blank">leaked renders</a>, the S25 Plus might share the design of the other two models, with flat sides all around and an entirely flat front and back glass with rounded corners.</p><p>Rumors also suggest that there could be a "marginal" dimension change with a possible size of 158.4 x 75.7 x 7.3, making it slightly smaller.</p><p>The current Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus has an Armor Aluminum 2 frame with tough drop and scratch resistance. Samsung also added Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2. The S24 Plus measures 158.5 x 75.9 x 7.7mm and has a glass back with a matte finish. The weight of the S24 Plus is 196 or 197 grams, and even though there is nothing official on the weight of the upcoming Galaxy, we expect it to be around the weight of the current model.</p><p>The Galaxy S24 Plus comes in Onyx Black, Marble Gray, Cobalt Violet, and Amber Yellow, with exclusive colors including Jade Green, Sapphire Blue, and Sandstone Orange.</p>

<p>Rumors suggest the Galaxy S25 Plus might have a 6.7-inch display. While we don't have the official specs, Samsung is also expected to add the S24's Dynamic LTPO AMOLED display to the upcoming device. We won't have to wait long to see the official specs for the Galaxy S25 Plus since Samsung said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-release-date" target="_blank">it will launch in the first half of next year</a>, but there is usually no monumental change from one model to the next.</p><p>Basically, the Galaxy S24 Plus's current display can give us an idea of what the next model might have. For example, it has a 6.7-inch display with an adaptive 120Hz refresh rate and a QHD 1440 x 3120 resolution. It also has a 19.5:9 ratio and 513ppi density, giving it a sharp resolution. The Galaxy S24 Plus has excellent colors, and the phone also supports HDR10 Plus.</p><p>The Super HDR preview is visible in the viewfinder and gallery. Samsung also added a peak brightness of 2,600.</p>

<p>While we don’t have the official Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus specs, that doesn't mean we can't get an idea thanks to the rumors. According to rumors, the S25 Plus might have a 4,900mAh battery. While the charging speed is unconfirmed, we can use the current model to get an idea.</p><p>According to rumors, the S25 Plus could have a more traditional DSLR camera lens. A<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-and-s25-plus-rumored-to-use-sony-sensors" target="_blank"> very early rumor suggests that</a> Samsung could stop using the ISOCELL GN3 sensor and swap it for Sony sensors. It's also possible that Samsung will stick with the same cameras for another generation.</p><p>Samsung will likely also offer the S25 Plus connectivity options such as NFC, GNSS, 5G connectivity, Bluetooth, and dual-band Wi-Fi. It could also have 45W wired charging. The Galaxy S25 Plus is likely to be powered by the Qualcomm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> chip, but we haven't encountered rumors about the storage and RAM specs.</p><p>However, the official Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus specs give us an idea of what to expect from the upcoming model. For example, the current model has a Qualcomm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> processor and 12GB of RAM. Storage options include 256GB and 512GB, and UFS 4.0 is also included.</p><p>The camera setup includes a 50MP wide-angle, 10MP telephoto, and 12MP ultrawide/selfie camera. You can record 8K videos with stereo sound and HDR10, which enhances the colors, brightness, and contrast of your phone's display.</p><p>The Galaxy S24 Plus features 45W wired charging, 15W wireless, and 4.5W reverse wireless.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus seems like a great phone to look forward to, but until we get the official specs, we can't say if it's worth upgrading to from the current Galaxy S24 Plus or if you should definitely choose it over its predecessor. If rumors are accurate and the Galaxy S25 Plus does get the much anticipated Snapdragon 8 Elite, it will undoubtedly make the newer model a more tempting option.</p><p>But for now, it's best to wait for the official release of the Galaxy S25 Plus to decide whether upgrading is a good idea. All we have to go on for now are speculation and rumors, and it's never a good idea to decide on devices based on those things. Also, newer models are usually more expensive, and if the upgrades don't justify the price, switching might not be a good idea.</p>

<hr>
<p>Nothing has recently announced stable Android 15 builds for its phones, including the Phone 2a and the flagship Phone 2. The builds were dubbed Nothing OS 3.0, and the company announced that they are now coming to the Phone 2a Plus handsets.</p><p>The latest firmware update is staggered, meaning not all Phone 2a Plus owners will receive the update immediately to ensure a smoother operating system rollout, notes Nothing in the accompanying <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nothing.community/d/24179-nothing-phone-2a-plus-nothing-os-v30-241226-1537-changelog">community post</a>.</p>

The prominent ones include Shared Widgets, which lets users use widgets to connect with their friends and family. Users can see others' widgets on their home screens and interact with them. The company notes that it is a new way for Nothing phone owners to stay connected.</p><p>The feature is still in beta and available for Photo Widgets, which can be shared. On the other hand, there are improvements that can be witnessed on the lock screen with the new customization page, which can be accessed by long-pressing the lock screen.</p><p>Users can further choose a new range of clock face styles, and there is a new expanded widget space that allows for the placement of more widgets on the lock screen.</p>
<p>Nothing OS 3.0 uses AI in some instances, like the AI-powered app drawer, which is dubbed Smart Drawer. It automatically categories apps into folders, further promising to make the app drawer more organized. Additionally, users can pin their favorite apps on the top for quicker access on the Phone 2a Plus.</p><p>The pop-up view for apps is also getting enhancements, like the ability to drag anywhere on the home screen, easily resize it, and pin it to an edge on the screen. Further, users can send their incoming notifications directly into the pop-up window by swiping down, which eliminates the need to switch to a different app and stay on the current app.</p>
<p>Other nifty design elements in the Android 15-based update include redesigned Quick Settings and a redesign of the widget library. There is also a new dot animation for fingerprint unlocking and charging.</p><p>AI is also being used to learn users' usage habits and inform them about their frequently used apps, simultaneously keeping them active for longer periods of time. The latest firmware has added an auto archive function to automatically free up storage on the Phone 2a Plus. Lastly, the update also includes the latest December 2024 security patch.</p><p>This firmware rollout makes all the company's latest phones run on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a>. Meanwhile, Nothing phone enthusiasts are looking forward to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Phone 2</a> successor, which is long overdue.</p>

<ul><li>The HMD OffGrid satellite accessory supports 2-way SMS messaging, live tracking, check-in messages, and SOS requests through an Android or iOS phone.</li><li>It supports coverage in North America, Europe, and Austalia/ New Zealand.</li><li>It costs $199 for the device, plus either $79/year or $15/month for satellite depending on the level of service.</li><li>It has three-day battery life, MIL-STD-810H durability, and a companion app for messaging.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>HMD Global, the brand behind recent Nokia smartphones, is branching out to satellite messaging. It announced the HMD OffGrid at CES 2025, a satellite accessory for smartphones that looks and performs similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-defy-satellite-link">Motorola Defy satellite link</a> released in 2023.</p><p>The HMD OffGrid uses L Band satellite via Viasat and Skylo (the Defy uses the latter service). It sends messages, voice notes, and check-ins to friends and family from the OffGrid app.</p><p>Your SMS messages will be sent from your phone number, so no one else needs to download an app to communicate with you. And real-time tracking will let you share your GPS-based location with up to 5 contacts — via a shared link — by pressing a button on the OffGrid.</p><p>While the HMD OffGrid is rated to last three or four days per charge, that's only with messages and check-ins at regular 30-minute intervals. While it has 10-day standby battery, it will last only a day or two if you're continuously using GPS and satellite for automatic 3-minute check-ins.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BVc5DG7SuUeYpVCF8athKP" name="HMD-OffGrid-press-photo-desert" alt="Photo of the HMD OffGrid satellite tool standing upright in the desert" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BVc5DG7SuUeYpVCF8athKP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: HMD)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Most importantly for anyone using this satellite dongle in signal-free areas, it supports SOS signals via the device's dedicated SOS button. Pressing it triggers a series of questions via Focus Point International, the 24/7 emergency service, such as "Are you alone?", "Where are you?", and "What happened?"</p><p>If necessary, Focus Point will send Overwatch x Rescue services to render aid as needed and foot the bill to rescue you — though you'll have to pay your own medical bills.</p><p>The satellite service covers the mainland and up to 70 miles away from the coast in participating areas like the Americas, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand -- with more territories coming "throughout 2025," HMD says.</p><p>"HMD OffGrid is a new, affordable, portable and easy-to-use offering that's both empoweing and reliable — especially when it matters the most," says HMD Chairman and CEO Jean-Francis Baril. "Whether you’re hiking in the mountains or skiing off-piste, HMD OffGrid ensures you’re never truly off grid."</p>

<p>The HMD OffGrid is IP68 dust- and water-resistant, as well as rated for MIL-STD-810H ruggedness. It weighs 60g (2.1oz) and has a dedicated spot for a carabiner, if you want to hang it off of a backpack. It seems very convenient to bring on an overland trip, though we have the same design concern as we did with the Defy: the exposed SOS button seems a bit too easy to press without a cover. Other satellite devices we've tested like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-gpsmap-67i-review">Garmin GPSMAP 67i</a> make you remove a protective cover from the SOS button.</p><p>Aside from the $199 upfront cost for the OffGrid, you'll need to pay for HMD Unlimited or HMD Freedom to make this more than a paperweight. Unlimited costs $14.99/month for limitless texts and check-ins, while Freedom costs $79.99/year with a 350-character limit for texts, $0.10 per location check-in, and a $20 activation fee.</p><p>HMD also mentioned that it would offer some sort of enterprise program for the OffGrid with unique features, though it didn't go into too much detail.</p><p>While more phones and carriers are adding satellite messaging or SOS services, from the iPhone 14 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/satellite-sos-launches-demo-pixel-9">Pixel 9 Pro</a> to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/verizon-skylo-partnership-satellite-based-texting">Verizon phones</a>, something like the HMD OffGrid or Motorola Defy gives you satellite access without tying it to a specific device.</p><p>Given that the Defy has generally received middling reviews and had to weather the bankrupcy of Bullitt Satellite Messaging — which was acquired by another company in 2024 — I'm sure outdoorsy folk will appreciate the HMD OffGrid as a potential alternative. The main question will be whether the satellite coverage and messaging works as intended.</p><p>For more info, or to preorder the HMD OffGrid, you can buy the satellite device on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.hmd.com/en_us/hmd-offgrid"><strong>HMD's website</strong></a>.</p>

<hr>
<p>As the Galaxy S25 series launch nears, leaks are coming in hot, and the latest one drops some fresh details on the pricing and color options for the vanilla and Ultra models.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-preorder-deals-what-to-expect">Galaxy S25</a> series is likely to arrive in up to seven colors, including blue. A recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2025/01/05/heres-your-first-look-at-galaxy-s25-and-s25-ultra-in-blue/" target="_blank">Gizmochina </a>report shows off the Galaxy S25 and S25 Ultra snug in Spigen's Crystal Flex cases. The images highlight their blue versions, each rocking slightly different shades.</p><p>As per the leak, the Galaxy S25 is rumored to launch in an 'Icy Blue' shade with a hint of frosty vibes. For the Galaxy S25 Ultra, the leak points to a 'Titanium Blue' color—a slightly muted but sleek shade.</p><p>These details align with a separate leak from Ishan Agarwal, who revealed color options like 'Silver Shadow,' 'Mint,' 'Icy Blue,' and 'Navy' for the Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus. Meanwhile, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is tipped to come in 'Titanium Black,' 'Titanium Gray,' 'Titanium White Silver,' and 'Titanium Silver Blue,' as per Agarwal's X post.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It seems like Samsung Galaxy S25 series is indeed getting Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy in Europe too.

<p>You’ll probably find even more color choices on Samsung’s website, though expect some regional differences.</p>
<div class="inlinegallery  inline-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:900px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="6Lzj6pCNDASa4eSXc9vbKW" name="Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra in blue" alt="Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra in titanium blue" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6Lzj6pCNDASa4eSXc9vbKW.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="900" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Gizmochina)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:900px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="U2Yv4XQ3ADygDWLMUU5iKW" name="Samsung Galaxy S25 phones in blue shades" alt="Galaxy S25" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U2Yv4XQ3ADygDWLMUU5iKW.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="900" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Gizmochina)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div>
<p>This new leak also backs up earlier reports that the Galaxy S25 Ultra will feature rounded corners and super-thin bezels. Keep in mind that these images are renders and might not reflect the final design, though.</p><p>The case images also highlight a MagSafe-style ring on the back of both devices, giving off iPhone vibes. There’s chatter that the Galaxy S25 series might not natively support Qi2 wireless charging, but instead, you’ll need accessories like the Spigen case to make it work. This approach seems to follow the lead of other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">leading Android phones</a>.</p><p>There are also rumors that the Galaxy S25 series will see a big upgrade in wireless charging speeds, jumping from 15W to 25W. This could make charging faster and more efficient for users.</p><p>Fortunately, the wait for Samsung's official word won’t be much longer—Samsung is set to reveal its 2025 flagship devices on January 22. All models are expected to pack the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset.</p>

<ul><li>Circular revealed its new Ring 2 smart ring at CES 2025 on Sunday.</li><li>Its key feature is an FDA-approved ECG for detecting AFib, with promises for future heart health tools.</li><li>It starts at $349, ships in four colors, and is the first Circular ring with rounded edges, women's health tracking, and a digital sizing phone tool.</li><li>The Circular Ring 2 won't have haptic feedback, a signature feature for the brand, though it should come back in future versions.</li></ul>
<p>At CES 2025, Circular has revealed its new Circular Ring 2, a major pivot from its last Circular Ring Slim in design, size, and features. It focuses more on health instead of wellness alone, with an FDA-approved electrocardiogram (ECG) for active AFib detection.</p><p>But to squeeze in the ECG, Circular had to make the Ring 2 heavier and cut its signature haptic motor, which would buzz your finger for notifications, alarms, reminders, or relaxation guidance.</p><p>We spoke with Circular CEO Amaury Kosman just prior to CES 2025 about the new Circular Ring 2. He said that they "didn't do everything as perfectly as we wanted to" when designing the Circular Slim, its first ring with fully custom tech designed entirely in France. The Ring 2 was designed to fix its predecessor's connectivity and sync issues, and with a newfound focus on aesthetics, accuracy, and longevity.</p><p>First, they had to "redo the entire mechanics of the ring" to give it rounded corners because past users "didn't like the feel" of the flat-edged versions. They also switched from aluminum to titanium and to a new hypoallergenic resin on the inside. And they offer four colors now, with Gold and Rose Gold available.</p>

<p>The Circular Ring 2 weighs about 5g, well above the 2g Slim, but the larger size lets them fit a larger battery and the new AFib-detecting ECG. While past models only lasted 2 days in "performance mode" or 4 days in "eco mode," Kosman says the Ring 2 will last 8 or 4 days, depending on how often you want the ring to sample.</p><p>Kosman says that its new ECG will be capable of several types of arrythmia detection, starting with AFib, tachycardia, and brachycardia, and with other unannounced features coming via OTA update throughout 2025, all based on the ECG. At launch, the Ring 2 will only offer active AFib detection by holding your finger for 30 seconds on the ring; Kosman says they want to use the PPG to "passively" catch abnormal heart rhythm overnight and prompt users to take an ECG, but that it's not ready yet.</p><p>For context, Ultrahuman announced an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-adds-afib-new-app-store-of-powerplugs">AFib powerplug update</a> last year, but it uses PPG data, requires a subscription, and isn't available in the U.S. yet. Otherwise, most of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">best smart rings</a> have no ECGs or AFib detection, making Circular ahead of the game for heart health data. Kosman also hinted that they may try to add other health metrics like blood pressure, but had nothing definitive to say.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2Ex3L6ifzAV4qBf4NJQ4gg" name="Circular-Ring-2-press-photo-black" alt="A press photo of the black Circular Ring 2 sitting half-obscured by an orange screen, with a desert view behind it" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2Ex3L6ifzAV4qBf4NJQ4gg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Circular)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unfortunately, Circular couldn't fit <em>both</em> an ECG and a haptic motor into the Ring 2, at least not without introducing "waterproofing and battery issues" in initial prototypes. But Kosman says a "new version" of the Ring 2 will bring back haptics; he simply can't say when it'll arrive yet.</p><p>Some other new Circular Ring 2 aspects include a new wireless charging dock, a "next-gen makeover" for the Kira AI that interprets your wellness data, and ovulation tracking.</p><p>Most interestingly, you'll be able to use your phone camera for digital finger sizing: You'll use something like a credit card for a reference point and have the Circular app tell you your five ring sizes on that hand. This will solve the inconvenience of having to wait for a physical sizing kit before buying one — though we'll have to see how accurate the digital tool is for finding a comfortable fit.</p><p>The Circular Ring 2 will have a crowdfunding campaign in January before releasing sometime in February or March 2025, with a starting price of $349.</p>

<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-and-ultra-2">Samsung Galaxy S25, Plus, and Ultra</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1406px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="MCC9YAmSEdQcicmoGWyhQk" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-stacked-alleged-rendering.jpeg" alt="An alleged rendering of the Galaxy S25 Plus." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MCC9YAmSEdQcicmoGWyhQk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1406" height="791" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung is celebrating a milestone with the S25's launch—15 years since it introduced the first Galaxy device. We expect the new series to have significant hardware and software changes compared to previous models.</p><p>According to several<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-leaked-renders-reveal-flat-design" target="_blank"> leaked renders</a>, the Galaxy S25, Samsung looks to be keeping it uniform with the design language across all three models, much like what Apple does with its iPhones. To everyone's relief, the phones are expected to have flat sides all around, completely flat front and back glass, and rounded corners, unlike the usual sharp square corners. But the Ultra version still seems to be keeping it a bit more edgy.</p><p>When it comes to cameras, which Samsung prides itself on every year, the new flagship devices are expected to receive some upgrades. Earlier this year, the phone was rumored to be ditching the ISOCELL GN3 sensors and going all-Sony. However, more recent rumors suggest that isn't the case, and Samsung will stick with the same cameras on the Galaxy S25 and Galaxy S25 Plus. On the other hand, the Ultra could have a f/1.7 aperture and a 23.2mm focal length. The sensor's maximum resolution will be 4080×3060, with a 200MP camera.</p><p>The flagship phones are said to come out of the box with the new One UI 7, which we will get to in a bit. Additionally, Samsung is loading this series with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/huge-one-ui-7-samsung-parent-ai-features-leak">more AI and new parental control features</a> into the OS.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZXEqXTh6mbDK3VRNheBtX7" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-dbrand-lineup-renders" alt="Galaxy S25 lineup renders with Dbrand skins" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZXEqXTh6mbDK3VRNheBtX7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Dbrand)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Galaxy S25 and Galaxy S25 Plus are rumored to launch in Midnight Black, Sparkling Green, Sparkling Blue, Silver Shadow, and Moon Night Blue colorways. The Galaxy S25 Ultra is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-all-seven-colorways-tipped">expected to launch in seven different colors</a>: Titanium Black, Titanium SilverBlue, Titanium Gray, Titanium WhiteSilver, Titanium JetBlack, Titanium JadeGreen, and Titanium PinkGold.</p><p>You may be asking, "But how much will all of this cost?". This flagship series could be quite pricey, with the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite" target="_blank">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> likely to power the Galaxy S25 series, bringing "astonishing levels of performance" that may require Samsung to hike the price up.</p><p>There have also been rumors about a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-slim-camera-specs-details-rumored">Galaxy S25 Slim</a>, although it's unclear if we'll see this at Unpacked or a later launch.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7 beta</a> arrived in eligible Samsung S24 devices just in time for Christmas, making it "the best version of One UI Samsung has made in a very long time," according to Android Central's Nick Sutrich.</p><p>The UI has a new and improved notification bar; pulling down on the right side of the status bar brings up a full screen of quick toggle buttons and sliders while swiping down on the left side of the status bar brings up notifications. Ring a bell? (See iPhone.)</p><p>Secondly, the beta version <em>finally</em> has a native vertical app drawer, something Galaxy users have wanted for years, although users can reset it to the horizontal version if it doesn't work for them. The app drawer has a scroll bar on the right for quickly moving between apps.</p>

<p>The next major display change users would notice is the multitasking UI, which finally allows you to see more than one app tile at a time. Samsung showcases its apps in a 3D carousel so users can quickly spot the next app on their scroll list.</p><p>Other updates on the OS include new icons, updated fonts, a new battery indicator, and an array of new widgets to dig your nails into.

<p>Another exciting thing that could be unveiled at this year's Unpacked is something Android developers and Samsung have been collaborating on— creating a wholesome XR experience with the Samsung headset dubbed project Moohan (meaning infinity in Korean).</p><p>"Imagine being in the world that understands you and responds to your every interaction," said Samsung's head of mobile R&D, Won-Joon Choi, at a recent live demo event.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a> will enable mixed reality interactions in the virtual world and the real one.

Another live demo of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Project Moohan</a>'s integration with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> showed its conversational multimodal abilities.</p>

<p>The headset that looks a lot like Apple's Vision Pro comes with a Snapdragon XR2 Plus Gen 2 and is set to debut in 2025 "with more devices to follow," according to Qualcomm.</p><p>We still don't have the specifics as to how much it would cost and what kind of abilities it will come equipped with out of the box. However, we might get a quick glimpse of some hardware at Unpacked. The Korean news outlet <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20241202129000017" target="_blank">Yonhapnews</a> indicated that Samsung might be showcasing a sneak peek of its first-ever smart glasses. It could be a short video or an image reveal—likely similar to the way the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Galaxy Ring</a> was shown off at the 2024 Unpacked Event.</p><p>It's unclear if the reveal will be the Project Moohan hardware or another product in development. That said, we're hoping we get a better idea at the upcoming Unpacked event.</p>

<p>While there's a lot of chatter about Samsung unveiling the Galaxy Ring 2, it seems highly unlikely, as it announced the first version of its ring just six months ago. However, what we might see is an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/another-clue-suggests-samsungs-bigger-galaxy-ring-sizes-are-in-the-pipeline">array of new ring sizes</a>—14 and 15—that may become available.</p><p>It's unclear if Samsung has any other tricks up its sleeve for its smart ring, so we'll have to wait and see what the company has in store and if it is planning any updates and feature additions.</p>

Head to Mint&apos;s website right now and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/google-pixel-9/6810275/"><strong>you can get a whopping $400 off the Pixel 9, plus 12 months of the popular Unlimited plan for just $180</strong></a> (that&apos;s a 50% discount). </p><p>In other words, you&apos;re looking at a full year of Android Central&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/best-unlimited-data-plans">favorite wireless plan</a> AND a top-rated flagship phone for <strong>only $579</strong> (or $25 if you pay using affirm). If this deal sounds familiar, it&apos;s because I&apos;ve been mentioning it pretty much every chance I get. There is no other Google Pixel deal that came <em>even close</em> to matching this value in 2024, the only catch is that you have to be willing to switch wireless carriers to receive the savings. But seriously, look at your most recent phone bill then look at this deal — it probably doesn&apos;t even come close. </p>

<p>Mint Mobile has extended the holiday deal that gives you 50% off both the Google Pixel 9 AND a year of its popular Unlimited plan, no strings attached. The carrier also got the Wintergreen color variant back in stock, so place your order now to enjoy that stylish, minty goodness.</p>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want a phone with great cameras, AI features, and 12GB of RAM; you live in an area with good T-Mobile coverage.</p>
<p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you're happy with your current wireless carrier; you don't want to be locked into a single carrier for a full year. </p>
<p>👀<strong>Alternative deal: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D7HVCD8R">$100 off at Amazon when you buy unlocked</a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/google-pixel-9/6810275/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="a37c2693-f0ab-4a9e-ad04-94cdedb63529" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$799" data-dimension48="$799">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/mint-mobile-review">Mint Mobile</a>&apos;s Unlimited plan gives you unlimited talk, text, and data (capped at 40GB before speeds slow) on T-Mobile&apos;s historic 5G/4G LTE network. You also get free calls to Mexico and Canada and a mobile hotspot. There&apos;s no contract or confusing fine print to worry about, and you&apos;re free to leave Mint after the year is up with zero hassle. Even if you do decide to switch carriers at that time, the Pixel 9 is yours to keep. </p><p>Speaking of which, as we detailed in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">our 4/5-star review</a>, the Google Pixel 9 ranks among our favorite flagship phones released this year, coming complete with seven years of guaranteed software support, a ton of useful AI features, and some of the best cameras found on any Pixel to date. </p><p>Just imagine: you can make a single payment right now and not think about your phone bill until 2026 — and <em>that&apos;s not even considering</em> the value of the Pixel 9. Yeah, it&apos;s that good. </p>

This brings us to what really the FCC is trying to impose on large tech companies, i.e., net neutrality.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/net-neutrality-rules-temporarily-blocked">Net neutrality</a> is a set of rules that could've been imposed on internet service providers that will force them to treat all browsing traffic fairly without favoring the ones they have partnerships with. For instance, Comcast, for example, owns Xfinity, which represents 40% of all broadband internet subscriptions, and it also owns NBCUniversal, which hosts streaming service Peacock. Without net neutrality, Comcast could prioritize Peacock streams over Netflix, slowing down the speeds of the latter. This results in a loss of autonomy for users who prefer one service over another.</p><p>The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed with the FCC's classification of ISPs as common carriers and ruled that the FCC had no authority to impose net neutrality rules.</p><p>"Unlike past challenges that the D.C. Circuit considered under Chevron, we no longer afford deference to the FCC’s reading of the statute," the judges wrote in their decision. "We acknowledge that the workings of the Internet are complicated and dynamic, and that the FCC has significant expertise in overseeing ‘this technical and complex area," they continue, adding that the agency's interpretation "cannot be used to overwrite the plain meaning of the statute."</p>

<ul><li>The Galaxy S24 series could see a fingerprint scanner boost with the next One UI 7 beta, speeding up unlocking.</li><li>Ice Universe leaked a preview video showing off the improved scanner, with sharper lock/unlock sounds also in the mix.</li><li>The third One UI 7 beta is expected to hit testers in early January, with the final update arriving after the Galaxy S25 launch.</li></ul>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a> series might be getting a biometric upgrade, with a new report hinting that the next One UI 7 beta will bring big improvements to the fingerprint scanner experience.</p><p>Reliable leaker Ice Universe spilled the beans about the upcoming One UI 7 beta 3 update, saying it’ll speed up fingerprint unlocking on the Galaxy S24 series. The leak also hints at sharper lock/unlock sounds for the Galaxy S24. To back it up, the tipster even dropped a video of the improved biometric scanner on X.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Not only the sound is clearer, but also the fingerprint unlocking speed is extremely fast, which is faster than the previous version. pic.twitter.com/7tCIKgGrOW<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1874716300125364605">January 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>It's fair to say that the Galaxy S24 series packs top-tier fingerprint tech, using ultrasonic sensors that outpace optical ones in speed and reliability. It works great even with wet hands, which has been a standout feature for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung’s flagship phones</a>.</p><p>But earlier One UI versions sometimes caused slowdowns, making the fingerprint unlock feel sluggish. So, it's reassuring to learn that the next update might address this.</p><p>The snappier animations add to the speedier feel, but with Always-On Display active in the demo, it’s hard to tell how much faster the fingerprint unlock really is. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s24-one-ui-7-beta-update-3-faster-fingerprint-unlock/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a> points out it might not feel as quick without Always-On Display.</p><p>Samsung’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7 beta</a> testing for Galaxy S24 users is currently underway, giving them a sneak peek at the upcoming update. The third beta is expected to roll out to testers in the first week of January.</p><p>However, the final One UI 7 update will roll out to the Galaxy S24 series after the Galaxy S25 launch. On the other hand, users not in the beta program will need to wait a bit longer to get these updates.</p><p>One UI 7 brings a number of nifty upgrades, including improved Galaxy AI and plenty of new features. Samsung is taking its time with this update, showing its commitment to polishing everything before releasing it.</p>

<p>Google might soon make it easier to connect hearing aids to your Android phone. After expanding hearing aid support in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>, signs point to the company exploring Google Fast Pair support for hearing aids. Code strings uncovered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/fast-pair-hearing-aid-3512718/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> hint at the functionality that appears to be in the works, and would make connecting hearing aids to an Android phone as easy as a pair of earbuds.</p><p>The work-in-progress code was uncovered in the <strong>Google Play Services 24.50.32 beta</strong>. For starters, the <strong>fast_pair_enable_hearing_aid_pairing</strong> code string indicates that Google is working on Fast Pair for heading aids. Additionally, a screenshot below shared by Android Authority shows hearing aids in the list of supported Google Fast Pair device types while running the Google Play Services beta.</p>

However, there are key differences between how hearing aids and Bluetooth earbuds are treated by operating systems, like Android 15.</p><p>Part of the reason for that is because most hearing aids use a Bluetooth Low Energy Audio (LEA) protocol separate from typical Bluetooth. This allows hearing aids to sound crisp and responsive while preserving battery life. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fast-pair-headphones-your-android-phone">Google Fast Pair</a> may be adding support for Bluetooth LEA devices such as hearing aids, according to the code strings revealed in the latest Google Play Services beta.</p><p>If this functionality ends up in a future Android update, it would be another way accessibility tech is becoming easier to use. According to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/hearing-loss#tab=tab_1" target="_blank">World Health Organization</a>, more than 1.5 billion people are living with hearing loss worldwide, so this is certainly an issue big tech companies could help improve for users.</p>

<ul><li>An industry expert from Korea says that Samsung will wait for the Galaxy Z Flip and Galaxy Z Fold 8 to make major changes.</li><li>Despite market pressure pushing Samsung to innovate, "expectations have dropped," the report explains.</li><li>The news comes after a down year in 2024 for Samsung that saw it apologize for not innovating.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>2024 turned out to be a rough year for Samsung. Multiple reports, as well as official financial releases from the company, indicated that sales were stalling. The situation became so dire that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-samsung-sorry-for-failing-to-innovate-or-just-sorry-sales-are-down">Samsung apologized for not innovating enough</a> and made changes to its leadership at the end of last year. Surprisingly, the latest reports out of Korea indicate that Samsung may be planning yet another incremental update for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=z+fold+7+andr5oid+central&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> this year.</p><p>Korean outlet <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=31905" target="_blank">The Elec</a> interviewed a representative for Fastprint, a circuit board company, about Samsung's outlook for 2025. For reference, Fastprint is one of the PCB companies contracted to supply parts for Galaxy phones. According to the interview, prospective buyers shouldn't expect major changes to Samsung's upcoming foldables.</p><p>"It seems to be a niche product yet, and (Samsung Electronics' foldable phone shipments are not increasing significantly) and the market seems to continue to expect Apple foldable products," the Fastprint representative said in the interview, translated to English. "If you look at the form factor of Samsung Electronics' foldable phone, it seems that there will be some changes from the Z8 series released in 2026, not the Galaxy Z7 series next year."</p><p>Despite increasing competition in the foldable market, Samsung doesn't appear to be rapidly innovating to make a better foldable phone, according to the expert.</p><p>"There is also a chase of Chinese foldable phones, and the release of Apple foldable products is expected, so it seems to be Samsung Electronics' strategy to respond to this, but expectations have dropped a lot," they said.</p>

<p>Being that the Galaxy Z Fold line hasn't received major upgrades since the Galaxy Z Fold 4 and the Galaxy Z Flip line hasn't been overhauled since the Galaxy Z Flip 5, this outlook is disappointing. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Google's Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> is a successful challenger to Samsung's larger foldables, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Motorola's Razr Plus 2024</a> is arguably the best clamshell foldable on the market. There could be a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-latest-oneplus-open-2-leaks-paint-a-beautiful-picture">OnePlus Open 2</a> this year to add more competition, and that just covers the foldables stateside.</p><p>It seems like a strange time for Samsung to take its foot off the gas, especially after it apologized for failing to innovate and sales dipped in 2024. Additionally, with the company reportedly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-next-galaxy-z-flip-might-have-a-surprise-processor">planning a budget clamshell foldable</a>, there will be more pressure for it to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-budget-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-fe-tipped-to-feature-a-flagship-caliber-display">differentiate the Galaxy Z Flip 7 and the rumored Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE</a>.</p><p>However, industry experts in Korea appear to be expecting progress to stall for another year. Although that would seem surprising considering the state of the foldable market, it would line up with Samsung's recent iterative smartphone updates.</p>

<hr>
<p>Music streaming services in 2025 have to balance delivering high-quality audio and creating memorable experiences. Things like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-find-your-spotify-2020-wrapped-apple-music-replay-youtube-music-year-review">Spotify Wrapped or Apple Music Replay</a> are shareable and engaging, and YouTube Music has something of its own with Top Listener badges. They're collectible badges awarded to people who listen to certain artists more than almost anyone else on the platform. However, YouTube Music subscribers are finding a strange bug that has them seeing double.</p><p>Top Listener badges for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music">YouTube Music</a> can be earned monthly, but users are seeing their November badges replicated in the app. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/03/youtube-music-top-listener-badges/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a> was the first to spot this small bug, which took the place of December badges expected to be sent this week.</p><p>YouTube Music badges show what percentile of top listeners you landed in for a particular artist. To find them, you can tap your profile photo and press the <strong>Badges</strong> tab. A page will open showing all the badges you've earned. Chances are, you'll see old badges duplicated rather than a new December badge thanks to this strange bug.</p>

<p>Like features such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify-wrapped-2024-arrives">Spotify Wrapped</a> or YouTube Music Recap, the monthly Top Listener badges are shareable. You can create an image card by tapping the three-dot menu on a badge and select <strong>Share</strong>, then <strong>Save image</strong>.</p><p>As 9to5Google notes, the bug may be corrected when the real Top Listener badges are sent to users for the month of December. YouTube Music sent out the November badges on Dec. 2, 2024, so the official December badges should be released soon.</p>

<p>Google said today it resolved widespread issues with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-home">Google Home</a> and Nest products not responding to commands that plagued users for nearly a week. First reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-nest-hub-audio-not-responding-3512418/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, the problems left Home and Nest speakers and displays incapable of answering even the most basic questions, like the time or the weather. The company is still investigating what caused the problems, but confirmed most users shouldn't experience the unresponsiveness now.</p><p>"The team is still investigating the root cause but have resolved the issue, so all users should be up and running now," a Google spokesperson explained.</p><p>The problems, which specifically affected voice commands, can be traced back to at least Dec. 30 as evidenced by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/assistant/thread/316085133/my-google-home-devices-stopped-responding-to-certain-questions-about-3-days-ago?hl=en" target="_blank">posts</a> on Google's support forum (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/02/google-home-nest-speakers-basic-commands-not-working/#more-655787" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). Although the Nest Hub displays in particular showed the correct weather and time, the voice assistant requests would hang up when asking for the same information. The displays showed a perpetual loading screen and couldn't respond to basic requests.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome/comments/1hpkzfg/google_home_mini_1st_gen_suddenly_just_keeps">Google Home Mini (1st Gen) Suddenly just keeps "thinking" and doesn't do anything?</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome">r/googlehome</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>Certain requests, like smart home or media control, were still functional. However, anything that required a Home or Nest speaker or display to fetch a response would fail. Luckily, it appears that the issues are resolved. Android Authority reported that its issues were no longer affecting its units, and Android Central tested that its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nest-hub-2nd-gen-review">Google Home Hub</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nest-hub-max-review">Nest Hub Max</a> were both able to respond to requests.</p>

<p>It's unclear what caused the speakers and displays to become unable to respond to requests over the last week or so. The bug could be related to how Google Home and Nest products decide which one will respond to requests, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/assistant/thread/316289033?hl=en&msgid=316411721&sjid=14626752115136997191-NC">support posts indicate</a> people with multiple speakers or displays were adversely affected.</p><p>Google support and Reddit posts chronicled the understandable frustration of users, but at least the issues appear to be resolved for now.</p>

<hr>
<p>Following the Biden administration's brief revival of net neutrality, a federal appeals court decided the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) does not have the authority to impose those rules on internet service providers (ISPs). The controversial set of net neutrality rules have been the topic of fierce debates for nearly a decade, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.opn.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/25a0002p-06.pdf" target="_blank">court's ruling</a> means they may be gone for good. More importantly, the decision sets further precedent that limits federal agencies' ability to regulate big tech, in aspects such as right-to-repair.</p><p>For those unfamiliar, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/why-net-neutrality-is-so-important#xenforo-comments-1067621">net neutrality</a> was a set of rules that essentially forced ISPs to treat all internet traffic equally. It didn't matter which website you wanted to reach or where you were located — ISPs couldn't give certain domains preference over another.</p><p>Why would an ISP want to do that? Comcast, for example, owns Xfinity, which represents 40% of all broadband internet subscriptions and is the nation-leading ISP by far, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/217348/us-broadband-internet-susbcribers-by-cable-provider/" target="_blank">Statista</a>. It also owns NBCUniversal, which hosts streaming service Peacock. Without net neutrality, Comcast could — in theory — prioritize Peacock streams over Netflix streams to put its own interests ahead of those of its subscribers.</p><p>So, that's the argument for net neutrality. The argument <em>against</em> net neutrality is that it will result in customers paying more for internet service. Think about it: If ISPs were allowed to slow down internet speeds of certain sites, it could demand that the companies hosting those sites pay for better preference. Without net neutrality, deals with big-name sites serve as a supplemental revenue sources for ISPs — revenue that would otherwise be attained by charging average people more.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="yYP2HL2K2EdWzpMifasiYS" name="nest-wifi-router-front.jpg" alt="Nest Wifi Router" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yYP2HL2K2EdWzpMifasiYS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For years, the FCC struggled to correctly classify ISPs. It started by calling them "information services" in 2005, which would not give the FCC authority to impose regulations upon them. Then, it shifted course in 2010, passing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-releases-open-internet-order" target="_blank">Open Internet Order</a>. Broadband providers sued to block the FCC's first stab at net neutrality rules and were successful, because the courts decided the FCC could only regulate "common carriers," like airlines, railroads, and some telecom companies.</p><p>It was settled — or so we thought. In 2015, then-President Barack Obama gave the green light for the FCC to reclassify broadband internet providers as common carriers. Thus, giving the FCC the authority to impose net neutrality rules as they are known today. Once again, it seemed settled, until the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/fcc-unveils-plans-roll-back-net-neutrality-rules">FCC decided to roll back net neutrality under then-President Trump in 2017</a>.</p><p>Finally, net neutrality got a second chance under President Biden, although it immediately faced grim legal challenges. That brings us to the present, when a federal appeals court struck down net neutrality seemingly for good with the help of newly-minted Supreme Court precedent.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5696px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yguQyZmBzYCV5yVGjLRKg7" name="asus-rog-gt-ax6000-review-top-angle-2.jpg" alt="ASUS ROG Rapture GT-AX6000 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yguQyZmBzYCV5yVGjLRKg7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5696" height="3204" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samuel Contreras / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Regardless of what you think about net neutrality, this decision is monumental. It's a confirmation of what was expected when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a legal principle established through precedent with the case Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) in 1984. The practice became known as Chevron deference, and it essentially meant that courts would give deference to expert regulatory agencies' interpretation of laws when deciding cases.</p><p>Why would the courts give deference to executive branch agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or FCC? The reasoning was twofold. For one, these cases usually concerned complex issues that the average federal judge was likely not an expert on, whereas regulator agencies are the authoritative subject matter experts in their respective fields.</p><p>Additionally, there was the thought that executive branch agencies were best fit to make major policy decisions because they could be held accountable by voters — we saw this in practice as net neutrality tumbled through the Obama, Trump, and Biden administrations.</p><p>When the Supreme Court killed the idea of Chevron deference last year, it gave courts nationwide the precedent to favor their own interpretation of the laws rather than those of regulatory agencies.</p><p>That's precisely how we got here. The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals didn't agree with the FCC's classification of ISPs as common carriers, and didn't think the FCC had the authority to impose net neutrality rules. For the first time in decades, the court's opinion held more weight than the agencies' opinion.</p><p>"Unlike past challenges that the D.C. Circuit considered under Chevron, we no longer afford deference to the FCC’s reading of the statute," the judges wrote in their decision. "We acknowledge that the workings of the Internet are complicated and dynamic, and that the FCC has significant expertise in overseeing ‘this technical and complex area," they continue, adding that the agency's interpretation "cannot be used to overwrite the plain meaning of the statute."</p>

<p>The decision is not only a massive blow to net neutrality, but also a hit to big tech regulation in general. If executive branch agencies — such as the FCC or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-is-suing-to-block-cfpb-oversight-over-google-pay-calling-it-government-overreach">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)</a> or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), can't reign in tech companies without explicit laws giving them the authority to do so — progress may stall.</p><p>That reality puts even more pressure on U.S. Congress to enact laws that regulate big tech, which can withstand judicial scrutiny.</p><p>"Consumers across the country have told us again and again that they want an internet that is fast, open, and fair," said Jessica Rosenworcel, the FCC chair, in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-408575A1.pdf" target="_blank">statement</a>. "With this decision it is clear that Congress now needs to heed their call, take up the charge for net neutrality, and put open internet principles in federal law."</p><p>If you've followed hot-button technology policy topics of late — think net neutrality, right-to-repair, antitrust, and interoperability — you'll know just how hard it is to get Congress to agree on these issues. Now that the Chevron deference is gone, and the new precedent has been applied to big tech for the first time, agencies will have limited leeway to regulate these conglomerates. Only time will tell how that, plus the transition to the Trump administration later this month, will affect the real progress made in big tech regulation over the last few years.</p>

<p>When I first began listening to the new Noble FoKus Apollo, which was just released at the end of 2024 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nobleaudio.com/products/fokus-apollo?srsltid=AfmBOoo8B4Bn7vddNA37eBd57OC6DJ_I4Fzk_M6Qp-8IvKSE6WoMM6P5" target="_blank">for $650</a>, I picked up some auditory masking of the mids and highs. I thought it was the 40mm dynamic driver shading the 14.5mm planar magnetic driver, but that wasn’t the issue.</p><p>Though the app is pretty bare bones, it does come with a 10-band EQ to help with any sonic issues you may have with its sound curve. You don't really need a lot of features in the app because the cans come with physical controls for most of the functionality.</p><p>I don’t know if it was burn-in, my ears adjusting, or the personalized sound feature, but there isn’t the slightest hint of masking anymore, and these headphones are some of the most balanced I’ve had the opportunity to have in my lab.</p><p>For testing, I connected wired and wirelessly to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Google Pixel 9</a>, Astell&Kern P1 DAP, iMac Pro, and an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>. For my wired connections, I used the iFi Go Link Max and Fiio/Jade Audio KA11 DAC dongles, though the FoKus Apollo <em>does </em>come with a USB-C cable for wired audio playback, and you’ll want to use it. I’ll explain.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="bYe3oYd56e3SQMxykb9nBC" name="noble-fokus-apollo-aux-cable-attached-alt2.JPG" alt="Noble FoKus Apollo showing cables and adapters, connected to A&K P1" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bYe3oYd56e3SQMxykb9nBC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I aired out the FoKus Apollo’s sonic abilities with a healthy mix of bass, electronic, and acoustic audio treats, which included tracks from Charles Mingus, The Roots, Composers Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and Michael Abels with the London Contemporary Orchestra, Jamiroquai, Skrillex, and Nina Simone.</p><p>The instrumentation, sound stage, and clarity in Mingus’ rousing romp, “Moanin’” is sublime. The mix of dynamic and planar drivers is apparent in the satisfying thump of the upright bassline, balanced by the masterfully played tenor and alto saxophones.</p><p>The FoKus Apollo gives you that “in your head” audio experience, and you <em>feel</em> every note of that with “Violin Duel” from the “Chevalier” motion picture original soundtrack. This aggressive violin piece will show how much clarity and texture your headphones reproduce. Using the FoKus Apollo, the chord changes, attack, and decay come alive. The way the tension between the bow and strings is produced makes it feel like you’re sitting next to the violinist.</p><p>All of the music I immersed myself in during the review period was a joy to listen to through the Apollo. It’s well appointed with all you need in the box to take in all the sonic glory, no matter your preferred delivery method. You get a 3.5mm cable, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/everything-you-need-know-about-usb-c">USB-C</a> for charging and audio pass-thru, and 4.4mm and ¼” adapters. Wireless connectivity happens via a Qualcomm Bluetooth stack utilizing Bluetooth LE, aptX/aptX HD, and LDAC support.</p><p>With all of that connectivity, the USB-C connection really brought out the most detail in the music I listened to. The balanced 4.4mm adapter also made an audible difference regarding how it extended the sound stage and bass.</p>

<p>Noble Audio’s attention to detail is apparent in the FoKus Apollo’s design and “packaging.” At $650, you don’t feel like they cut corners or cheaped out on accouterments like some competitors.</p><p>As I stated, the Apollo comes with everything you need in the box, so there is no need to track down compatible third-party cables and accessories unless you really want to.</p><p>The hard case is thiccc (yes, three C’s thicc) and will take up a lot of space in a backpack, purse, or luggage, but it is well appointed and offers excellent protection from its EVA shell. Inside are pockets for your cables and a velvet pouch for your adapters.</p><p>Let me take a brief moment to say that the 3.5mm cable is beefy! The metal connectors and cable thickness are worthy of the premium price point.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="kRv3FTuQFQr4QeRrCAqiaD" name="noble-fokus-apollo-earpads.JPG" alt="Noble FoKus Apollo showing earcups and headband" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kRv3FTuQFQr4QeRrCAqiaD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The headphones themselves have soft Alcantara on the headband’s contact surface and pleather-wrapped memory foam replaceable earpads, all set on an anodized aluminum frame, making the headphones comfortable for extended listening sessions.</p><p>The earpads are large enough to fit comfortably around my ears without feeling constricting, unlike some other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">high-end headphones</a> I’ve reviewed.</p>
<p>The physical buttons are responsive, and intuitive. Having a physical mute botton on them is also a nice touch.</p>

<p>Though the cans swivel to fit inside their case and adjust to your unique head shape, they don’t fold, so their footprint is large. Hybrid active noise cancellation and internal mic audio are both ok.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sony-1000xm5-vs-bose-quietcomfort-45" target="_blank">Sony and Bose</a> won’t be getting a run for their money as the headphones let in some highs when noise canceling is active, but they work just fine for <em>dampening</em> urban noise and airplane engine hum.</p><p>I will say that built-in microphone audio quality is underwhelming at this price point, especially given how stellar the headphone’s music playback is.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="76f3yEwwz2cgbb3VYJFqqD" name="noble-fokus-apollo-boom-mic-attached.JPG" alt="Noble FoKus Apollo with the excellent boom microphone attached." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/76f3yEwwz2cgbb3VYJFqqD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The saving grace here is that the included boom mic attachment sounds <em>great!</em> So, if you’re using these at home, in the office, for taking work-related phone calls, or for Zoom meetings, you’ll have great microphone quality with the boom that competes with some of today's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-noise-canceling-headphones" target="_blank">best noise-canceling headphones.</a></p><p>Out of the box, without EQ, the sound quality is solid. Even with that, I’d love it if they added the ability to control bandwidth to the Noble app’s 10-band EQ. Being an audiophile product, having the ability to adjust Q is always a welcomed addition.</p><p>I’d also like the ability to adjust ANC and transparency modes. While the transparency mode is excellent, I’d like full ANC and to see what that sounds like on these headphones instead of full-time hybrid ANC.</p>

<p>Noble Audio has something special here. Though these are aimed at the wireless market, the “FoKus” is clearly on sound quality, and I’m good with that. The combination of a large, 40mm dynamic driver with a 14.5mm planar magnetic produces a bright sound with “in your head” clarity while delivering deep bass and rousing mids. The overall package is entertaining, engaging, and comfortable, with everything you need to enjoy your favorite sounds right there in the box.</p><p>Whether you’re listening via Bluetooth, USB-C, or 3.5mm/4.4mm/ 1/4” cable, if you have the coin, the Noble FoKus Apollo are worth it, with one caveat: if you’re ok using the boom mic attachment for your most important phone calls. And I’ll say it again: if you’re dipping your toes into the audiophile pool, invest in a great pair of headphones <em>before</em> you spend a bunch of money on your audio source and accessories, like a DAC or DAP.</p>

<ul><li>A new leak revealed that both the OnePlus 13 and 13 R might get a Sandstone magnetic case, with the 13 possibly offering Aramid Fiber and Wood Grain Magnetic Half-Pack cases.</li><li>Sandstone cases offer great grip with their sandpaper-like texture, while Aramid Fiber cases provide strong protection without the bulk.</li><li>The magnetic cases will easily snap on and likely work with other magnetic accessories like Qi2 wireless chargers.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>OnePlus is preparing for the global launch of its next flagship series. Ahead of the unveiling, official cases for the OnePlus 13 and 13R have surfaced online, and they might be getting a smart new upgrade.</p><p>Leaker Sudhanshu Ambhore hopped on X to give us a sneak peek at the case lineup for the OnePlus 13 series. Both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a> and 13R are tipped to get a Sandstone magnetic case, but the OnePlus 13 might step it up with a more premium selection, including an Aramid Fiber magnetic case and a unique Wood Grain Magnetic Half-Pack case.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">OnePlus 13 series offiical cases.OnePlus 13R Sandstone Magnetic CaseOnePlus 13 Sandstone Magnetic CaseOnePlus 13 Aramid Fiber Magnetic CaseOnePlus 13 Wood Grain Magnetic Half-pack Case pic.twitter.com/i8af14N2fe<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1874726042465927669">January 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>OnePlus’ Sandstone cases are a classic for a reason. With their fine sandpaper-like texture, these cases not only look sleek but also deliver better grip, keeping accidental slips at bay.</p><p>Meanwhile, Aramid Fiber cases are all about tough protection without the bulk, thanks to their lightweight yet super-strong build. And if you’ve got a soft spot for OnePlus’ old-school wood grain cases, the Wood Grain Magnetic Half-pack option is the perfect mix of style and practicality.</p>

<p>The leaker points out that these cases are magnetic, so they’ll easily snap onto your phone. Plus, they’ll probably work perfectly with other magnetic accessories, like Qi2 wireless chargers.</p><p>OnePlus recently unveiled some magnetic accessories for the OnePlus 13 in China, so expect them to hit global markets soon. OnePlus President Kinder Liu previously <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-oneplus-13-is-bringing-its-own-spin-on-magsafe">confirmed </a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-oneplus-13-is-bringing-its-own-spin-on-magsafe" target="_blank">that the phone will support magnetic wireless charging</a>, showing that the company is ready to jump on the growing trend of magnetic accessories, just like other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">premium smartphones</a>.</p><p>While OnePlus heard the love for past bamboo cases, Liu made it clear that it won’t be making a comeback for the OnePlus 13. Instead, OnePlus will offer stylish wood-grain covers with a "magnetic suction function."</p><p>Apple has had the MagSafe advantage for a while, with a whole ecosystem of magnetic accessories. Android users, on the other hand, have had to deal with third-party adapters to get something similar.</p><p>That said, 2025 is about to flip the script. With more brands jumping on the Qi2 wireless charging bandwagon and building their own magnetic accessory collections, Android is finally bringing that same smooth, convenient experience Apple users have been living with.</p>

<p>When we first reviewed the Motorola Edge 2024, it was priced at $550 and didn't have the hardware to match that price point. Fast forward half a year, and the Motorola Edge 2024 is routinely available for under $300. At such a low cost, the Edge 2024 is a lot easier to consider — even if it comes with a few compromises compared to modern flagships.</p><p>If you're looking for a new smartphone, you might be wondering how much you really need to spend to get a great experience. This comparison will help you out because we're comparing the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S25 to the Motorola Edge 2024. One is a midrange phone now priced like a budget device, and the other is a bona-fide flagship. Let's figure out which one is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phone</a> for you (and which is the best value).</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-vs-motorola-edge-2024-design-and-display-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. Motorola Edge 2024: Design and display</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="FXWvyXFj3YuLhGvQJxiVY" name="motorola-edge-2024-back-04.jpg" alt="The gorgeous vegan leather back of the Motorola Edge (2024)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FXWvyXFj3YuLhGvQJxiVY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At first glance, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-2024-review">Motorola Edge 2024</a> might appear cheap-looking compared to the Galaxy S25's rumored design. Samsung's next flagship is expected to feature a glass back, brushed aluminum rails, and large DSLR-style camera bumps. By comparison, the Motorola Edge 2024 features a vegan leather back and only one Midnight Blue colorway. It does have aluminum rails, but from afar, Motorola's design language doesn't stand out.</p><p>The good news is that the in-hand feel of the Motorola Edge 2024 is much better, according to our reviewer. There's a curved display and back panel that makes the phone more comfortable to hold than rectangular, boxy flagships like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24 series</a>. Additionally, the vegan leather material adds a grippy feel compared to slippery glass or plastic. In other words, don't underestimate the Motorola Edge 2024's design.</p><p>The full specs of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Samsung Galaxy S25</a> aren't known for sure, but we can infer that the Motorola Edge 2024 will be bigger than Samsung's base-model flagship. Motorola's midranger has a 6.6-inch pOLED display with a 2400 x 1080 resolution and a 144Hz refresh rate. The Galaxy S25 is expected to get a bigger screen this year, but it'll only be bumped to 6.2 inches, so it'll still be smaller than the Motorola Edge 2024.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1412px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="j694D5wu5mdb9MzUKqC72V" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-angled-look-early-alleged-rendering.jpeg" alt="An angled, rumored rendering of the Galaxy S25." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/j694D5wu5mdb9MzUKqC72V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1412" height="794" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If Samsung continues its longtime design trends with the Galaxy S25, that phone should be smaller and lighter than the Motorola Edge 2024. The latter measures 159.63 x 71.99 x 7.99mm and weighs 174 grams, whereas the Galaxy S24 weighed just 168 grams. The Samsung Galaxy S25 might be great for people who want a compact phone, but the Motorola Edge 2024 gives you the chance to get a screen roughly the size of a Galaxy S25 Plus on a budget.</p><p>While the Motorola Edge 2024 does have a camera bump, it's much smaller than the Galaxy S25's camera housing is expected to be. Overall, Motorola's design language is less flashy. Although the company calls the phone's color Midnight Blue, it's basically black.</p>

<p>Both phones expectedly feature a hole-punch selfie camera, USB-C, and have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-do-waterproof-dustproof-rugged-ip-rating-numbers-mean">an IP68 dust and water-resistance rating.</a> If you like unique colors, you'll have to get the Galaxy S25 — it is expected to come in Moon Night Blue, Silver Shadow, Sparkling Blue, and Sparkling Green.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-vs-motorola-edge-2024-hardware-and-specs-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. Motorola Edge 2024: Hardware and specs</h2>
<p>In terms of hardware, the Samsung Galaxy S25 will blow the Motorola Edge 2024 out of the water. Of course, that's because the Motorola Edge 2024 will likely be multiple hundreds of dollars cheaper than Samsung's upcoming flagship. Still, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite" target="_blank">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> chip is all but certain to power the Galaxy S25 and will trounce the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-7s-gen-2-launch">Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 2</a> in the Motorola Edge 2024.</p><p>There are some areas where the Motorola Edge 2024 will beat out the Galaxy S25, though. For starters, the Edge 2024 supports 68W wired charging speeds, which are much higher than anything Samsung has offered in the past. Additionally, the Edge 2024 has a 5,000mAh battery capacity. While it's rumored that Samsung will bump the Galaxy S25's capacity to 5,000mAh, it's not confirmed yet.</p>

<p>Camera performance is one area where the Galaxy S25 will shine. It's expected to have a triple-camera system with a 50MP wide lens, a 12MP ultrawide, and a 10MP telephoto lens. On the front, there's rumored to be a 12MP selfie camera.</p><p>While the Motorola Edge 2024 does have a 50MP main camera, Samsung has the superior sensor and computational photography. Plus, the Edge 2024 only offers a dual-camera layout. There's a 13MP ultrawide and no telephoto lens, something that may be sorely missed in 2025.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-vs-motorola-edge-2024-performance-and-software-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. Motorola Edge 2024: Performance and software</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="i4pZZvLZrTTi5FZhp67c5U" name="motorola-edge-2024-hello-moto.jpg" alt="The Motorola Edge (2024)'s pOLED display showing the boot logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/i4pZZvLZrTTi5FZhp67c5U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Performance and software are ticks in favor of the Samsung Galaxy S25, largely thanks to the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset inside it. Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite chip is the successor to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a>, but it's much bigger than an annual upgrade. This processor uses the same custom Oryon cores as Qualcomm's Snapdragon X platform and is faster as a result. Meanwhile, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 2 inside the Motorola Edge 2024 is firmly a midrange chip — it's not on the same level as the company's flagship processors.</p><p>The extra power of the Samsung Galaxy S25 will help it provide artificial intelligence features now and in the future. The phone will likely come with new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI features</a> that top what Motorola can offer. Additionally, the seven years of software support you get with modern <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Galaxy phones</a> will keep them up and running for years to come. By comparison, Motorola's software support is notoriously poor.</p><p>The Motorola Edge 2024 will only get two major Android updates and three years of security patches. It started with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> is already out, so software support is already nearing the end. It also takes Motorola a while to update its phones to new Android versions, which is another thing to consider. If longevity and performance are top priorities, you may want to avoid the Motorola Edge 2024.</p>

<p>It might seem easy to want the Motorola Edge 2024 at its attractive price point, however, the Samsung Galaxy S25 is likely to be the better value. Although the Motorola Edge 2024 is serviceable, it'll only get one more Android OS upgrade despite costing $300 at the time of publishing. On the other hand, the Galaxy S25 will start with Android 15 and get seven more Android OS upgrades after that.</p><p>If you can make the Galaxy S25 last the full seven years, or even half that, it'll probably be a better value than buying the middling Motorola Edge 2024.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung is redesigning Good Lock, the company's first-party launcher known for bringing advanced features to Galaxy phones, with One UI 7.</li><li>The app will be available in "all countries" and on the Google Play Store for the first time.</li><li>Certain features are getting a boost, like Home Up, which can now be used with One UI Home without the app active.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Good Lock, the popular first-party Samsung launcher for enthusiasts, is getting a redesign and expansion with One UI 7. In a post on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://r1.community.samsung.com/t5/good-lock/굿락-one-ui-7-업데이트-소식/td-p/31156891" target="_blank">Samsung community forum</a>, the feature manager detailed Good Lock changes that will arrive with the release of One UI 7. Samsung is trying to make the upgraded Good Lock launcher ready for release alongside the regular One UI update, but certain features might take longer to release.</p><p>Notably, Samsung is making <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-good-lock">Good Lock</a> more widely available. Previously exclusive to the Galaxy Store, the app will be available for download from the Google Play Store starting with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a>. For the first time, the post reveals Good Lock "can be used in all countries."</p><p>Good Lock is a popular choice for users of Samsung foldables. Specifically, the first-party launcher is the only official way to use any app on the cover screen of Galaxy Z Flip smartphones. This year's revision of Good Lock will include a few major changes that'll improve the UI of the launcher for not only foldables, but regular Samsung phones.</p><p>"The overall composition of the main app has been changed for UI convenience," the post explains. Samsung cites better search and filtering functionality, easier widget management, and added Good Lock functions as a few things that will debut alongside One UI 7.</p>

<p>For fans of Home Up, there's great news. The post calls Home Up "one of the most changed apps" this year, and it starts with letting users use Home Up on One UI Home without running the Home Up app.</p><p>Additionally, users will be able to place icons anywhere on the home screen without having to follow a strict grid. Other changes include gesture animation customization, folder customization, edge panel customization, and taskbar customization. This was previously <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/one-ui-7-good-lock-module-customization-update-spotted">rumored following an October 2024 leak</a>.</p><p>Finally, the post reminds Good Lock fans that features well-received by enthusiasts could become standard One UI features in the future.</p><p>"Please use the Good Lock apps that show big and small changes and give us your opinions so that we can continue to develop them based on them," the post explains. "Features that receive good responses are continuously being absorbed into One UI features, so please continue to give us feedback in the future."</p><p>Although <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsungs-first-one-ui-7-beta-is-available-now-public-release-set-for-early-2025">the One UI 7 beta is already available</a> for the Galaxy S24 series, the refreshed Good Lock app is still at least a few weeks away.</p>

<p>Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-fit-3-announced">launched the Galaxy Fit 3</a> in most major regions early last year but left out the United States despite selling the Fit 2 there in 2020. At the time, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-fit-3-not-getting-us-launch">Samsung told us</a> that "market trends and needs for each region" explained why the Fit 3 would skip this territory.</p><p>Evidently, the economics have changed, as Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-galaxy-a16-5g-galaxy-fit3-now-available-in-us/">announced</a> a U.S. Galaxy Fit 3 launch on January 9, for an affordable $59.99. Fans of the Galaxy Fit 2 who dislike how short-lived the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a> is have a new 13-day option, with a 1.6-inch AMOLED display that's 45% wider than the Fit 2's.</p><p>The affordable tracker has a water-resistant squircle design with a single button and touchscreen controls, without the touch bezel or circular look of most Galaxy Watches. It's much lighter, skinnier, and longer-lived than your typical Galaxy Watch, too, though this trade-off comes with limitations: It uses a battery-saving RTOS instead of Wear OS that can't handle apps or messaging.</p><p>Unlike the Galaxy Fit 2, the Galaxy Fit 3 doesn't appear to be compatible with iPhones, though we're following up with Samsung to confirm. Some features may also be Galaxy phone-specific, such as Find My Phone and remote camera controls.</p><p>The Galaxy Fit 3 also supports notifications, fall detection, emergency SOS, Samsung Health insights, and music playback controls from your nearby Android phone.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy Fit 3 has over 100 preset watch faces and just as many sports modes. Although it uses your phone's GPS for outdoor workouts, it'll still detect your heart rate, arm movements, and altitude for measuring stairs climbed.</p><p>When it comes to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fitness-trackers">best fitness trackers</a> in the U.S. today, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-charge-6-review">Fitbit Charge 6</a> is expensive and requires a subscription, while Xiaomi bands like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/xiaomis-next-gen-fitness-tracker-could-hit-stores-worldwide-soon">Smart Band 9</a> are inconsistently available and Amazfit hasn't sold a new band since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-band-7-review">Band 7</a> in 2022.</p><p>Even though smartwatches have become much more popular than cheap trackers, Samsung must see a market gap to target cheap wearable buyers who will trust the Samsung brand and appreciate the subscription-free health and fitness insights.</p><p>We're excited to test the Samsung Galaxy Fit 3 for ourselves and see how its heart rate and sleep accuracy compare to those of a Galaxy Watch. As a launch promotion, Samsung is selling the Fit 3 for 50% off if you buy it with the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-galaxy-a16-5g-comes-to-the-us-with-a-bigger-screen-and-longer-software-support">Galaxy A16 5G</a>.</p>

<ul><li>Leaker reveals older Galaxy phones will be skipping the One UI 7 beta program.</li><li>These models include Galaxy S23, Galaxy S22, and Galaxy S21 series.</li><li>They might see the stable release directly in the first week of February.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung has been releasing betas of its much-anticipated One UI 7 since the start of this month. While most of the latest Galaxy phones have received these betas, a new leak suggests that older models might not be able to get the Android 15-based OS betas.</p><p>According to tipster @FamilyTaes on X (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://androidpolice.com/samsung-may-skip-one-ui-7-beta-for-older-galaxy-phones/">Android Police</a>), the older Galaxy models, including the Galaxy S23, S22, and S21 series, won't get betas but rather stable builds in the first week of February 2025. The older models, according to the tipster, include the Galaxy A series as well.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">S24 series OneUI 7 beta 3 will release between 30th~6th (Can be +- 2 days).After beta 3 there'd be 2~3 more beta builds at max.S23/22/21/A series won't have any beta program.Stable rollout schedule will be announced at unpacked, 22nd Jan (most probably Feb 1st~2nd week).<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1871635939304542366">December 24, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>On the other hand, the tipster further shared details about the One UI 7 beta 3, which is likely to be released by January 6. The release will be followed by two or three more beta builds before the Unpacked event, which is rumored to take place on January 22, in the U.S. and in tandem with the company's home country, South Korea.</p><p>For the uninitiated, the Galaxy S24, S24 Plus, and Galaxy S24 Ultra models were the first handsets to receive the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7 beta</a> in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsungs-first-one-ui-7-beta-is-available-now-public-release-set-for-early-2025">first week</a> of December. The enrolled beta testers of the aforementioned devices later received the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/one-ui-7-beta-2-galaxy-s24-rollout">second beta</a> in the U.S. region in the third week of the same month.</p>
<p>While the new operating system has many new features, one of the highlights is the 'Now Bar,' which came with the first version of One UI 7.

<ul><li>Currently, you can sync dismissed notification statuses between Pixel devices, but there's a catch.</li><li>Syncing only works between Pixel phones and tablets when you're connected to Wi-Fi.</li><li>In a future update, Google could add a toggle that enables cellular data use for notification syncing.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is building a multi-device ecosystem with the Pixel brand, and there were a few <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> tweaks that made the experience of using multiple Pixel phones and tablets better. One such feature automatically dismisses notifications from all your Pixel devices if you dismiss on either your Pixel phone or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Pixel Tablet</a>, and it's quite handy. However, it only works over Wi-Fi, which isn't very helpful if you're dismissing notifications on your smartphone when you're out and about.</p><p>The company is seemingly aware of this limitation and is testing an option to use cellular data to sync notifications, according to code strings spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-notification-dismissal-sync-3511975/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>. The strings were spotted in <strong>version 1.0.687093228_arm64-v8a_release_phone</strong> of the Device Connectivity Service app. This is a Pixel-specific app that handles cross device services between Pixel phones behind the scenes. In it, there's evidence that Google might one day let you use cellular data for notification syncing.</p><p>The toggle is simply described as letting users "use mobile network to sync when no Wi-Fi is connected." It's not visible publicly, but the functionality could be added in a future software update.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1056px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:107.77%;"><img id="RMSHCKwW76jiph4Z2FQpU9" name="Dismiss-Notifications-Pixel" alt="The new toggle for dismiss notifications across Pixel devices." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RMSHCKwW76jiph4Z2FQpU9.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1056" height="1138" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To date, notification syncing for Pixel devices has been limited to Wi-Fi connections only. "Dismiss notifications across Pixel devices syncs when each device is connected to Wi-Fi," the fine print explains. This is likely to preserve battery life and cellular data usage. A toggle giving users the option to enable cellular use would be ideal for people who are willing to sacrifice the battery life hit or have unlimited data plans.</p><p>Although the <strong>Dismiss notifications across Pixel devices</strong> is exclusive to Pixel phones and tablets, Google is also working on more general Cross Device Services that bridge the gap between other Android brands. More recently, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/androids-cross-device-services-just-became-available-for-another-brand">Cross Device Services came to Nothing phones</a>.</p><p>For now, Pixel users will need to continue waiting for Wi-Fi to sync their dismissed notifications between their Pixel phones and tablets. However, this new development provides some hope that one day there might be a cellular option.</p>

Fortunately, Samsung has decided to lessen the blow by offering up to $1,200 off when you process a trade in. If you don't have an old device to get rid of, skip the trade-in altogether and you'll still get $300 off. </p>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want a sophisticated foldable phone with great performance, long software support, and AI features; you have an old device to trade in. </p>
<p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you need the best cameras and battery life; you can get a better deal through your wireless carrier. </p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> is easily one of the best foldable phones ever built, with two outstanding AMOLED displays, a powerful Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset, and the latest Galaxy AI software features. As with Samsung&apos;s S24 flagship series, you&apos;re also guaranteed to receive seven years of OS and security updates. </p><p>Now, to be honest, I can&apos;t recommend spending nearly two grand on a smartphone, even if it is foldable and high-tech. But if you can manage to score some sweet trade-in credit with this deal, it&apos;s seriously worth checking out. </p>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25"><em><strong>The Samsung Galaxy S25 series is coming: here's everything we know so far</strong></em></a></li></ul>
<p>Only recent devices like the Galaxy S24 Ultra and Galaxy Z Fold 5 will earn you the full $1,200 trade-in discount, but phones dating back to the Galaxy Z Fold 3 will land you an excellent $1,000 off. I even plugged in my beat-up Galaxy S9, just for fun, and was shocked to see that I was eligible to receive $500 off. Dig up your old phones and use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-z-fold6/buy/galaxy-z-fold6-256gb-unlocked-sm-f956uakaxaa/"><strong>Samsung&apos;s trade-in tool</strong></a> if you&apos;d like to see how much you can earn with this offer.</p><p>In addition to the trade-in savings, Samsung is offering up to 30% off accessories like the Galaxy Watch 7 when you order it alongside the Z Fold 6. You&apos;ll also get three months of YouTube Premium, three months of Peacock Premium, and two months of Adobe Lightroom for free. It&apos;s one of those deals that just keeps getting better and better, so check it out before it&apos;s gone.</p>

<ul><li>The Samsung Galaxy A16 5G and Galaxy Fit 3 are coming to the U.S. next week, priced at $199.99 and $59.99, respectively.</li><li>Samsung is offering six generations of full OS upgrades on the Galaxy A16 5G, a first for a product at this price point.</li><li>The Galaxy A16 5G also includes a new Exynos processor, an IP rating, and a larger screen.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung is bringing two popular budget devices, the Samsung Galaxy A16 5G and the Samsung Galaxy Fit 3, to the U.S. next week, it announced in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-galaxy-a16-5g-galaxy-fit3-now-available-in-us/" target="_blank">press release</a> today. Both the budget smartphone and fitness tracker will be available starting Jan. 9, 2025 at retailers nationwide. As the successor to last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-a15-5g-review">Galaxy A15 5G</a>, the new Galaxy A16 5G provides a longer software support window and more durability at the same price point.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-a16-5g-six-year-promise-launch">Samsung Galaxy A16 5G</a> builds off the improvements made with the Galaxy A15 5G, which was the first to add an OLED screen. This time around, the 6.7″ FHD+ Super AMOLED display on the Galaxy A16 5G is larger, still offering a 90Hz refresh rate and 800 nits of peak brightness. The design of the handset is similar, too, but there are some hidden changes to this year's budget smartphone.</p><p>Notably, Samsung is switching from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-6100-plus-launch">Mediatek Dimensity 6100+ chipset</a> to its own Exynos 1330 system-on-a-chip. That may be why Samsung is able to offer best-in-class software support for a $199 smartphone with the Galaxy A16 5G. You'll get six generations of One UI and Android OS upgrades. The smartphone starts with One UI 6, which is based on Android 14. Even if one of those six-generations promised cancels out since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> is already here, it's still remarkable — and Samsung gives six years of security updates, too.</p>

<p>The company also managed to make the Galaxy A16 5G more durable, as it's now rated for IP54 protection against dust and water ingress. That won't provide the same level of protection as IP68 and IP69 flagships, but it is impressive for a smartphone at this price point.</p><p>Additionally, the Galaxy A16 5G ships with a 5,000mAh battery and 25W fast charging support. As for cameras, there's a 50MP main sensor, 5MP ultrawide, and 2MP macro lens on the rear.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy A16 5G will cost $199.99, and the Galaxy Fit 3 will cost $59.99. When the two devices become available for purchase next Thursday, Jan. 9, buyers can save 50% off the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-fit-3-announced">Galaxy Fit 3</a> when they buy a Galaxy A16 5G from Samsung's online store.</p>

<p>It has also shared the steps on how to use the Circle to Search on the respective phones. The conventional methods include long pressing on the home button if users prefer the three navigation buttons on their devices. Users who opt for gestures can long press the navigation bar to trigger the Circle to Search feature. Enabling the feature on the said Nothing phones is relatively simple.</p><p>Users need to navigate to the device's <strong>Settings > Special features > Gestures > Navigation mode > Circle to Search</strong>. Also, if you own either <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Phone 2</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Phone 2a</a>, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-plus-is-here-and-its-got-a-chip-no-one-else-has">Phone 2a Plus</a>, you would want to make sure that you are running Nothing OS 3.0 and with the following build numbers:</p>
<ul><li>Phone (2): <strong>Pong-V3.0-241207-0124</strong></li><li>Phone (2a): <strong>Pacman-V3.0-241210-2057</strong></li><li>Phone (2a) Plus: <strong>PacmanPro-V3.0-241126-1448 (Beta build)</strong></li></ul>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="xGuYeKMnPUi7hn9AvEsw7U" name="thinborne-galaxy-z-fold-5-iphone-15-pro-max.jpg" alt="Thinborne case for Galaxy Z Fold 5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xGuYeKMnPUi7hn9AvEsw7U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Namerah Saud Fatmi: </strong>Believe it or not, the phone case market is pretty cutthroat. There are literally thousands of brands out there, so it's really hard to single out the diamond in the rough. Thinborne consistently delivers impossibly slim phone covers made of sturdy aramid fiber, winning it the title of the best phone case brand in 2024.</p><p>"Borne" out of Texas, each accessory from this all-American brand is made with love by a surprisingly small team dedicated to creating the thinnest phone case in the world. Most slim cases sacrifice durability, but not the ones from Thinborne. What’s even more impressive is that the brand’s latest creations come with MagSafe baked in!</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-wireless-headphones-sonos-ace"><span>Best wireless headphones: Sonos Ace</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Q4pRhV7ncQ6A7mdcHSgFQP" name="Sonos-Ace-in-hand.jpg" alt="Carrying Sonos Ace headphones from headband." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Q4pRhV7ncQ6A7mdcHSgFQP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Tshaka Armstrong: </strong>There were some notable firsts for wireless headphones in 2024. Chief among them, and the one many consumers probably didn’t see coming, was Sonos’ first pair of wireless over-ear headphones, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sonos-ace-review">Sonos Ace</a>. Imagine it: headphones that tie into one of the best home theater ecosystems, and they may actually sound more personal and immersive than your home theater setup.</p><p>That’s just the beginning. With built-in WiFi, the Ace can receive audio handed off from Sonos’ soundbars, with Dolby Atmos support, and they’re also a highly capable pair of Bluetooth headphones, supporting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bluetooth-audio-terms-codecs-explained">hi-res wireless audio codecs</a>. You also get impressive active noise canceling that rivals industry leaders Sony and Bose. You can also listen to lossless audio files via a wired connection if you choose.</p><p>Being first-gen, though, they aren’t without some growing pains. For instance, the headphones can’t connect to all of the speakers in Sonos’ lineup, and their connection is only one way, so no transferring music from your phone/headphones to your Sonos speakers.</p><p>Despite any first-gen shortcomings, the team here at Android Central thinks the Sonos Ace are the best wireless headphones of 2024. With the Ace on the market, Sony and Bose’s lack of innovation in this area becomes a glaring omission. Maybe that will change in 2025</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-wireless-earbuds-google-pixel-buds-pro-2"><span>Best wireless earbuds: Google Pixel Buds Pro 2</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="w8GaRqHxCyTEQB4fyeeaLG" name="google-pixel-buds-pro-2-color-array-2.jpg" alt="Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 array of colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/w8GaRqHxCyTEQB4fyeeaLG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Tshaka Armstrong: </strong>It was an excellent year for Bluetooth earbuds! Whether it was artificial intelligence taking center stage, hi-resolution wireless audio support, or booming bass from open-ear designs, there was something for everyone.</p><p>With regard to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">wireless earbuds</a>, that “something for everyone” was best exemplified in Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-review">Pixel Buds Pro 2</a>. This iteration of their Buds Pro line was redesigned to fit more people’s ears, which is huge. What isn’t huge is their size. Powered by their in-house Tensor A1 chip, Google managed to make them more comfortable, fit more tech, more battery life, and an acoustic redesign into a smaller package, and that is part of what makes them Android Central’s pick for best wireless earbuds of 2024.</p><p>A huge factor in earning that designation is that the only major feature you lose by not having the Pixel Buds Pro 2 connected to a Pixel phone is Spatial Audio with head tracking. That ensures these buds have a bit of something for everyone, no matter who makes your favorite phone.</p><p>Three of my favorite aspects of the Pixel Buds Pro 2 are:</p>
<ul><li>Impressive spatial audio quality, as I listened to Blue Eye Samurai on Netflix which supports spatial audio for movies.</li><li>From sound quality customization via EQ, to real-time hearing wellness monitoring, the Pixel Buds app elevates the Pixel Buds Pro 2 experience.</li><li>Native Google Gemini support. It’s in its infancy and as a result definitely has some growing pains but Gemini Live integration with the Pixel Buds Pro 2 was engaging, even if a bit rough around the edges.</li></ul>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-streaming-device-google-tv-streamer"><span>Best streaming device: Google TV Streamer</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zG58uwCatbYwnLZsweERoa" name="google-tv-streamer-review-22.jpg" alt="Google TV Streamer with Android figure and remote" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zG58uwCatbYwnLZsweERoa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Harish Jonnalagadda:</strong> Most TV streaming boxes aren't worth the bother, but thankfully, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv-streamer-review">Google TV Streamer</a> is a worthy successor to the mighty Chromecast. The streaming box has an interesting design, plenty of power, and all the codecs you need — it has no issues with HDR videos on YouTube. There's no jitter when navigating the interface; it runs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv">Google TV</a> and lets you install all your streaming services via the Play Store, and it has no trouble streaming high-bitrate content.</p><p>In short, it is a terrific streaming solution, and you're getting a good value as these things go.</p><p><strong>Runner-up:</strong> NVIDIA Shield TV Pro</p><p>I still prefer the second-place pick, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/nvidias-shield-tv-pro-is-still-the-best-streaming-device-in-2024">NVIDIA's Shield TV Pro</a>. It has been around for over five years, but it still has the best overall hardware, and it continues to get regular updates. If you need extras like the ability to connect an external drive or stream games via a service like Moonlight, the Shield TV Pro is still my pick. But if you just need a reliable media streaming solution, the Google TV Streamer can't be beat right now.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-smart-home-device-nest-learning-thermostat-4th-gen"><span>Best smart home device: Nest Learning Thermostat (4th Gen)</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fsxSwZiBnHnu9SoXgsVkMb" name="google-nest-learning-thermostat-gen-4-06.jpg" alt="The shiny Google Nest Learning Thermostat (Gen 4)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fsxSwZiBnHnu9SoXgsVkMb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Andrew Myrick: </strong>With 2024 coming to an end, there's still a feeling that bigger things are on the horizon for smart home devices. That being said, Google's release of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/future-google-pixel-watch-models-should-steal-this-nest-learning-thermostat-design-feature">Nest Learning Thermostat (4th Gen)</a> was a long time coming. The previous iteration was released back in 2018, and while the 3rd Gen is still an excellent option, it was definitely time for an upgrade.</p><p>Google managed to deliver exactly that with the 4th Gen, essentially putting an enlarged Pixel Watch in control of the comfort at home. Along with the larger display and slimmer bezels, the Nest Learning Thermostat (4th Gen) also brings Matter support to the table, something that is becoming increasingly important.</p><p><strong>Runner-up:</strong> Tapo 2K Indoor Security Camera</p><p>Speaking of Matter, Tapo is one brand that has been making waves, so much so that its lineup of smart security cameras made our list. Do you need a cheap camera to keep an eye on your puppy while you're out and about? The Tapo 2K Indoor Security Camera is just $30. Are you tired of needing to figure out how to open the door for someone while you're in the middle of doing housework? Snag the Tapo Smart Battery Video Doorbell for $80.</p><p>Tapo falls under the TP-Link umbrella but has been growing in popularity for a variety of reasons. Currently, there are 17 different listings on the Tapo storefront, which is already impressive, and Tapo offers a fantastic smart home security ecosystem on a budget, including this fantastic security camera.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-92">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Code found in the latest Google app beta hints at free access to Gemini Advanced for Galaxy S25 buyers.</li><li>Free access could vary by model: the base S25 might get 3 months, the S25 Plus could have 6 months, and the S25 Ultra may score a full year.</li><li>The code also hints at a broader plan, with a Motorola device possibly getting in on the Gemini Advanced action.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung's next-generation <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a>, set to drop this month, promises a hefty dose of AI features, building on last year’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>. But Samsung might up the ante with free access to Google’s Gemini Advanced AI models.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-free-gemini-advanced-3511917/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> dug up some juicy details in the beta version 15.52.37 of the Google app, hinting at a big Google-Samsung team-up. Buried in the code are four lines pointing to free access to Gemini Advanced.</p><p>The strings mention access periods from one month to a full year, likely depending on which Galaxy S25 model you purchase.</p><p>How long you get free access depends on your Galaxy S25 pick. Presumably, higher-end models are expected to get longer trial periods. This means that the base model might offer a three-month trial, the S25 Plus could bump it to 6 months, and the S25 Ultra is rumored to score a full year of free access to this AI service.</p><p>This tempting offer could definitely push buyers to grab an S25 once it arrives.</p><p>Looking closer at the code, it hints at a bigger plan. While the Galaxy S25 series is in the spotlight, there’s also mention of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> and an unnamed Motorola device, plus the chance that other devices could join in, making Gemini Advanced more accessible across the Android ecosystem.</p><p>Giving devices access to Gemini Advanced isn’t new. Last year, Google’s Pixel 9 Pro models came with a free one-year subscription to this advanced AI service.</p><p>What sets Gemini Advanced apart is the AI it uses. It taps into Google’s most advanced models, going way beyond the standard Samsung Galaxy AI. This means it’s better at handling complex tasks like coding, logical reasoning, understanding multi-modal inputs, and even teaming up on creative projects.</p><p>Gemini Advanced also speeds up image generation compared to the free version. Plus, it works smoothly with core Google services like Gmail, Google Docs, Google Sheets, and more.</p><p>It’s a cool bonus, if it pans out, especially with all the power Gemini Advanced packs. While Google has released a few versions of Gemini, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-advanced-subscribers-can-now-use-gemini-flash-2-0-experimental-in-latest-gemini-app-beta">only Advanced users get the latest models</a>, like 2.0 Flash and 1.5 Deep Research, which just started rolling out this month.</p>

<ul><li>An early Geekbench 6 result appeared for the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra ahead of its release.</li><li>While the scores are lower than other Snapdragon 8 Elite handsets, the system information report reveals Samsung may be overclocking its chip.</li><li>Two of the Snapdragon 8 Elite's eight CPU cores appear to be overclocked, potentially for a Snapdragon 8 Elite "for Galaxy" branded chip.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung's upcoming Galaxy S25 series is widely expected to be powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset. However, it has been unclear whether Samsung will use an overclocked version of the processor, much like the "for Galaxy" versions of Snapdragon chips in previous Galaxy phones. There's now a good chance that we'll see a Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Samsung Galaxy S25</a> thanks to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/9695154" target="_blank">prerelease Geekbench 6 scores</a>.</p><p>The benchmark scores showed up for the international model of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra in the Geekbench 6 database, as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_s25_international_model_specs_geekbench-news-65919.php" target="_blank">GSMArena</a>. The scores themselves aren't that impressive — the benchmark results below are lower than what we've tested with other Snapdragon 8 Elite phones, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-9-pro-review#section-asus-rog-phone-9-pro-performance">Asus ROG Phone 9 Pro</a> — but the clock speeds of the chip are higher.</p><p>According to the system information report on the Geekbench 6 results page, two of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> cores are clocked at 4.47 GHz, which is slightly higher than the default 4.32 GHz speed. Meanwhile, the six-core cluster remains at the usual 3.53 GHz speed. This suggests that Samsung will ship an overclocked version of the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip on the Galaxy S25 series.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:862px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:137.12%;"><img id="kG8J2ESeaN5vsorro83fXW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Geekbench-6" alt="The Geekbench 6 scores for the Galaxy S25 Ultra." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kG8J2ESeaN5vsorro83fXW.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="862" height="1182" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Geekbench)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As for the performance dip, that is all but certainly attributed to the fact that these benchmarks were recorded on pre-release hardware and software. It's likely that the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra's final benchmark scores will end up higher than these early figures. Another factor to consider is that the Galaxy S25 Ultra tested was a unit with 12GB of RAM, and Samsung could offer a 16GB version with faster performance.</p><p>Though this benchmark leak does suggest Samsung is working on overclocking the Snapdragon 8 Elite for its next flagships, it isn't a guarantee. This could simply be a test to see whether an overclocked version meets Samsung's quality standards. However, this late in the release cycle — the Samsung Galaxy S25 series is expected to debut this month — it's likely that this benchmark overclock is indicative of the company's plans.</p><p>Regardless of whether Samsung overclocks the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, it's significantly faster than the last-gen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a>. Additionally, prior rumors predict that the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-samsung-galaxy-s25-will-be-exclusively-powered-by-snapdragon-8-elite-leaker-claims">will power the Galaxy S25 series in all markets</a>.</p>

<hr>
<p>The OnePlus 13R is less than a week away from an official reveal, and we're now learning more about exactly what specifications the midrange smartphone will have. While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a> is a known quantity due to its China release, the OnePlus 13R has a bit more mystery. It's loosely based on the OnePlus Ace 5, but has plenty of unique tweaks. According to the latest leaks and rumors, the OnePlus 13R will get a significant camera upgrade over the Ace 5 and its predecessor, the OnePlus 12R.</p><p>Leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/heyitsyogesh/status/1873981828920426500" target="_blank">Yogesh Brar on X (formerly Twitter)</a> shared rumored camera specs for the OnePlus 13R. The main camera is a 50MP Sony LYT-700 lens with a 1/1.56-inch sensor size and a stacked CMOS image sensor. That's paired with an 8MP ultrawide camera that appears to be the same sensor used on last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a>. Finally, the third camera sensor is a 50MP Samsung JN5 lens capable of 2x optical zoom.</p><p>Samsung's JN5 sensor may not be a telephoto lens like the ones we've become accustomed to, and it only achieves 2x optical zoom. However, it's a lens that has become commonplace across mobile devices due to its many uses.</p><p>"The JN5’s slim optical format makes it highly versatile, allowing it to be used across main and sub cameras — including wide-angle, ultra-wide-angle, front and telephoto — promising a consistent camera experience from various angles," Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-unveils-versatile-image-sensors-for-superior-smartphone-photography" target="_blank">explains</a>.</p>

<p>If this rumor pans out, the 50MP Samsung JN5 sensor will replace the 2MP macro lens on the OnePlus 12R. This would be a long-overdue move that'll result in improved camera performance for OnePlus 13R users. Typically, small macro lenses are rarely used and don't always provide performance better than applying a macro effect to the main sensor. Put simply, the JN5 telephoto will be far more appreciated by OnePlus 13R users than the 2MP macro lens was on the OnePlus 12R.</p><p>Additionally, Brar reveals that the OnePlus 13R's selfie camera will be a 16MP lens. That's the same as the OnePlus 12R, and it's likely that the selfie camera will be unchanged as a result.</p><p>Ahead of the OnePlus 13R's official launch, we now know quite a bit about the device. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/a-massive-leak-seemingly-reveals-official-oneplus-13r-renders-and-colors">Leaked renders revealed the two colorways</a> for the smartphone, including every angle of the phone. We also know it'll be powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset</a>, just like the OnePlus Ace 5, thanks to a leaked Amazon listing. On top of that, OnePlus confirmed this phone will have a thin form factor and a 6,000mAh battery capacity.</p><p>To learn more about the OnePlus 13R, you can watch<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-oneplus-13r-is-a-thin-midranger-with-a-6-000mah-battery-arriving-january-7"> the Jan. 7, 2025 launch event</a>.</p>

<hr>
<p>After mixed reports chronicled whether Samsung would ever make a cheaper foldable, it looks like a midrange or budget "Galaxy Z Flip FE" is in the works. Earlier this week, a GSMA database entry confirmed the existence of the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip FE. Now, a renowned display analyst has predicted the panel that the Galaxy Z Flip FE will use, and it's good news for potential buyers interested in the foldable.</p><p>Ross Young, a display analyst and the CEO of Display Supply Chain Consultants (DSCC), says that the Galaxy Z Flip FE will use the exact same display panel as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>. That means the inner screen probably won't be one of the areas Samsung compromises on to cut the sticker price of its upcoming budget foldable. Additionally, it'll put a bit of pressure on Samsung to make sure the Galaxy Z Flip 7's screen is better than the one used in the Galaxy Z Flip FE.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Z Flip 6 panel.<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1873886050399269268">December 31, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>For reference, the display in the current Galaxy Z Flip 6 is a foldable Dynamic LTPO AMOLED screen. It has a 1080 x 2640 resolution, features a 120Hz refresh rate, and offers HDR10+ and 2,600 nits of peak brightness. With fairly thin bezels and a hole-punch camera cutout, it's one of the best clamshell foldable screens available to date.</p>

<p>The prior GSMA database entry confirms the Galaxy Z Flip FE's model number of SM-F761B. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-next-galaxy-z-flip-might-have-a-surprise-processor">Other rumors indicate that the Galaxy Z Flip FE</a> will be powered by the Exynos 2400e, which is the same chip found in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-hands-on">Galaxy S24 FE</a>. Now, an analyst with a rock-solid track record thinks the Galaxy Z Flip FE will feature the same screen as the current Galaxy Z Flip 6.</p><p>There are still many questions that remain, like exactly how cheap the Galaxy Z Flip FE will be. We'll also be watching the Galaxy Z Flip 7 to see what improvements Samsung makes to differentiate these two foldables.</p>

I have tried YouTube Music and Apple Music, but frankly, neither of them really meets my needs as well as Spotify does. The app this year also has one of my favourite end-of-year features "Spotify Unwrapped" and this year it integrated a lot of AI to give me more information on my listening habits! <br><br>I will say that while Netflix is the king of streaming services there are many others out there with great shows. But of course, there can only be one winner and we picked Netflix! There are a lot of great shows and it's highly entertaining, not to mention that the streaming giant is also getting into the world of live TV, which we suspect will expand over the next year. <br><br>Finally, we couldn't finish this list without talking about the best Android app: Gemini. Google outdid itself with a truly remarkable app and it's one the AC Staff has been very excited about using. <br><br>Congrats to all the winners! <br><br>Of course, here's what some of my colleagues, Derrek Lee, Patrick Farmer, and Namerah Saud-Fatmi have to say about the winners,</p>

<p><strong>Derrek Lee: </strong>We just can’t quit you, can we? Spotify continues to be not only our favorite music streaming service but, apparently, everyone else’s too. Just in November, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2024-11-12/spotify-reports-third-quarter-2024-earnings/">reported</a> that it has 252 million subscribers, up 12% from the previous year. It also has more than 640 million monthly active users, which is up 11% from last year. So why do we love Spotify so much?</p><p>The streamlined UI just makes it impressively easy to listen to the music you love and discover new tracks. And while Spotify has yet to introduce its<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/years-later-spotify-still-says-its-working-on-super-premium-with-lossless-audio"> long-awaited Hi-Fi tier</a>, the company continues to add and test new features to stay ahead of the game, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify-launches-personalized-ai-playlists">personalized AI-generated playlists</a> that let you tell it what you want to listen to. It also added a<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify-launches-new-basic-plan-for-the-us"> cheaper base plan</a> for users who don’t need access to audiobooks.</p><p>It was a pretty good year for Spotify, but we hope 2025 will be a great year for audiophiles who await higher-quality listening. With any luck, we’ll finally get that “Super Premium” plan we’ve been hearing about.</p><p><strong>Runner-up:</strong> YouTube Music</p><p>Meanwhile, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music">YouTube Music</a> is our runner-up as Google continues to make its streaming app more competitive. This year, the company has made a few tweaks to the UI and added a number of AI features to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-music-is-testing-letting-you-build-custom-radio-stations-using-ai-prompts">help you create playlists</a> and thumbnails. It hasn’t been too exciting of a year for YouTube Music, but it’s steadily becoming a worthy Spotify competitor for anyone looking. Earlier this year, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-music-premium-100-million-subscriber-celebration">Google celebrated 100 million subscribers</a>, so something must be working.</p>

<p><strong>Patrick Farmer: </strong>Despite a controversial <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/netflix-q2-2023-earnings-report">password-sharing crackdown</a> and another round of predicted price increases on the horizon (according to analysts), 2024 was a great year for Netflix. From blockbuster films to original series and holiday romcoms — did anyone else watch “The Merry Gentlemen”? Just me? All right, moving on — Netflix has content for just about every type of user.</p><p>This year may not have seen Netflix dropping any groundbreaking cultural phenomena like “Squid Game” or “Stranger Things,” but it has continued to hold the line as the world’s most popular streaming service. And with its recent foray into the world of gaming, it’s clear that Netflix has no intention of resting on its laurels any time soon.</p>

<p><strong>Namerah Saud-Fatmi: </strong>Apps are available a dime a dozen, but it takes an infinite amount of effort and beyond to make the best one. Google had all the right resources for the job and put them to work with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a>. This language model married the smarts of Google Assistant to concoct the ultimate Android app.</p><p>With Gemini, anything is possible. Need to create automations for your smart home? No problem. Have some code that needs help getting written? Done deal. There's very little this AI can't handle, be it image generation or pulling from all your Google services like Gmail to answer prompts.</p>

<hr>
<p>LineageOS, an Android custom ROM project that aims to support both new and old smartphones, is already adding support for Android 15. The team <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://lineageos.org/Changelog-29/" target="_blank">announced</a> today, Dec. 31, that LineageOS 22.1 is rolling out based on the latest Android 15 QPR1.  It was able to bring <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> to LineageOS quicker than expected due to the breakthroughs made adapting Android 12 through Android 14, according to the blog post.</p><p>"This is far-and-away the easiest bringup cycle from a device perspective we have seen in years," wrote Nolen Johnson, the developer relations manager for LineageOS, in the blog post. "This means that many more devices are ready on day one that we’d typically expect to have up this early in the cycle."</p><p>Aside from the system improvements brought by Android 15, LineageOS 22.1 includes a few new features and additions. For starters, security patches as recent as November 2024 have been merged to LineageOS 19.1 through 22.1. There are also two new apps: Twelve and Camelot.</p><p>Twelve is a brand-new music player that replaces the prior music player, Eleven. As one of the oldest LineageOS apps, the team explained that it was time for a replacement. Eleven was becoming noncompliant with new Android guidelines due to its older codebase, and Twelve is an improved replacement.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:7200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:43.33%;"><img id="cGpcrv7K3ZMuPHWsZuNcJU" name="Twelve-Lineage-OS" alt="The new music app included in LineageOS." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cGpcrv7K3ZMuPHWsZuNcJU.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="7200" height="3120" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: LineageOS)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Some of the new app's highlights include Material You design language and support for tablets and landscape mode. It'll integrate with major music server protocols, like Subsonic, OpenSubsonic, and Jellyfin. On top of that, there's better search, improved Android Auto support, and new support for streaming protocols — such as HLS, DASH, and SmoothStreaming.</p><p>Camelot is a basic PDF viewer that aims to fill the gap left by LineageOS' Jelly and WebViews, which can't open PDF files. It's described as a simple app based on Google Chrome and Files by Google releases.</p><p>LineageOS will use a decimal integer system moving forward to match Android's quarterly platform releases (QPRs). LineageOS 22.1 is based on Android 15 QPR1, and a future Android 15 QPR2 update would eventually lead to LineageOS 22.2.</p><p>Of course, LineageOS is best known for supporting older devices, and support is excellent out of the gate. You can find more information on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/" target="_blank">LineageOS Wiki</a>, but over 100 devices are eligible for the latest upgrade on day one. That includes older devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-2-review">Google Pixel 2</a>, and newer ones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Google Pixel 9 series</a>.</p>

<ul><li>New features found within the OHealth app preview fitness and health tools that could come to the OnePlus Watch 3.</li><li>The app includes ECG support, wrist temperature detection, a 60-second checkup mode, and more.</li><li>Separately, code strings reveal that OnePlus may be releasing two OnePlus Watch 3 variants: a OnePlus Watch 3 and OnePlus Watch 3 Pro.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Although the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a> offered the best battery life of any Wear OS watch while hitting an affordable price point, it fell short in a few areas. Notably, the OnePlus Watch 2's fitness and health monitoring was lacking. OnePlus might be flipping the script with the OnePlus Watch 3, adding an expansive suite of fitness and health features that could make it competitive with some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best smartwatches</a> around.</p><p>For starters, we should point out that these new features could be coming to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/major-oneplus-watch-3-specs-leak">OnePlus Watch 3</a> <em>series</em>. According to a report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-watch-3-pro-3512051/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, code strings in the OHealth app include mentions of not only a OnePlus Watch 3, but also a OnePlus Watch 3 Pro. On top of that, a separate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-watch-3-ohealth-features-apk-teardown-3512061/" target="_blank">report</a> details a handful of new health features found in <strong>version 4.30.11_e27d199_241122</strong> of the OHealth app.</p><p>Notably, the app appears to support features that aren't possible with current OnePlus Watch hardware. The biggest new functionality is electrocardiogram (ECG) support, which was absent on the OnePlus Watch 2 but could come to the OnePlus Watch 3 series. You'll be able to start an ECG reading from your smartphone (providing it meets OnePlus' system requirements), and get access to health insights based on the results.</p><p>For example, an ECG reading could result in any number of determinations, including sinus rhythm, atrial fibrillation, frequent PVCs, frequent PACs, high or low heart rate, or an inconclusive reading. Not all of these results are bad (sinus rhythm is simply the term for the regular electrical impulses of a heart pumping) but all of them can be insightful.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1625px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.55%;"><img id="svVSTf8aNtaStwTBs7SSjM" name="IMG_0541" alt="Screenshots of the Ohealth app from an APK teardown from Android Authority." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/svVSTf8aNtaStwTBs7SSjM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1625" height="919" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another new capability found in the OHealth app is wrist temperature detection. Like other smartwatches that offer the feature, you'll need to wear your OnePlus Watch to sleep for five days to get a baseline temperature. From there, you'll be able to view whether your wrist temperature is normal, above baseline, or below baseline.</p><p>Since the OnePlus Watch 2 lacks a temperature sensor, this once again looks like an upcoming OnePlus Watch 3 and Watch 3 Pro feature.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="eQBqDky2XkE7PBWYDQekpQ" name="oneplus-watch-2-15.jpg" alt="OnePlus Watch 2 activity data" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eQBqDky2XkE7PBWYDQekpQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Some of these features are just OnePlus catching up to the competition, but others are brand new — like the 60-second checkup mode uncovered in the OHealth app. It'll run a quick check of seven health indicators to look for signs of a few major health risks: heart health, blood vessel elasticity, and sleep snoring.</p><p>To house all of these features, the OHealth app is gaining a dedicated Health tab for these data points. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-wishlist">With how underwhelming the OnePlus Watch 2 was</a> in terms of health and fitness capabilities, it's a good sign that the OHealth app seems to be getting prepped for a slew of new offerings.</p>

<ul><li>A tipster claims to have discovered several model numbers concerning the future of Samsung's foldables in the One UI 7 beta.</li><li>From the list, it seems Samsung is crafting the next Flip 7 and Fold 7, as well as another Fold Special Edition.</li><li>The rumored "Flip FE" was notably missing; however, a recent database discovery detailed its model number.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>With Samsung pushing ahead with its One UI 7 beta, its code might hold clues about the company's overall foldable plans.</p><p>A teardown of the beta thus far by AssembleDebug (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-flip-7-special-edition-model-numbers-3511581/">Android Authority</a>) reportedly contains a list of model numbers. According to the tipster, the list of internal names suggests the future of Samsung's foldables, beginning with the book-style device, the Galaxy Z Fold. The post states the beta offers model number SM-F968, which is supposedly a "successor" to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-special-edition-vs-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition</a>.</p><p>Speaking of new foldables, the publication states that it did not find signs of a "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-flip-fe-rumors-rekindled-next-year">Galaxy Z Flip FE</a>." This clamshell has been rumored for a few months now; however, the tipster states the latest software beta didn't contain its would-be model number.</p><p>What the beta does contain are the apparent model numbers for Samsung's next wave of Galaxy Z Flip and Fold devices. Allegedly, the upcoming wave of phones feature model numbers SM-F751 and SM-F966, respectively. The post is relatively confident that these concern the next-gen foldables, considering the model numbers have jumped "by 10," which is "tradition with Samsung."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3916px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="CKLZzpWPboeS8xmGaHgZC9" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-review-28.jpg" alt="The Galaxy Z Flip 6 on a wireless charger" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CKLZzpWPboeS8xmGaHgZC9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3916" height="2203" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The One UI 7 beta curiously lacks the rumored Flip FE model number, but a recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-working-on-a-cheap-galaxy-z-flip-and-a-surprise-for-the-watch-8">GSMA database discovery</a> holds more for us. The device's internal number — SM-F761B — was discovered recently and believed to be the highly anticipated Galaxy Z Flip FE. This device is expected to arrive as a cheaper alternative to the standard flagship clamshell model in 2025.</p><p>More importantly, a rumor from November claimed the device <em>could </em>launch alongside the Flip 7 and Fold 7, likely in the middle of 2025. Additionally, the phone could debut with Samsung's in-house Exynos 2400e chipset. This is the same chip that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-hands-on">Galaxy S24 FE</a> sports.</p><p>This isn't the only Samsung foldable news to surface as, last week, a report claimed the company was interested in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-foldable-unit-shipment-changes-report">slashing its 2025 shipments</a>. Compared to the Flip 5/Fold 5, Samsung's Flip 6/Fold 6 was underwhelming and underperformed. It's been rumored that the Korean OEM could set aside roughly 5 million foldable units next year with the Flip 7 making up ~3 million of them.</p><p>For context, the company's Flip 5 and Fold 5 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-foldable-preorders-break-records-south-korea">shattered records</a> with a whopping 1.02 million pre-orders in South Korea. Fast forward to 2024 and those numbers dropped to 910,000.</p><p>Elsewhere, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/one-ui-7-beta-2-galaxy-s24-rollout">second One UI 7 beta</a> kicked off before Christmas for the S24 series. It brought a wealth of error and malfunction fixes while others await its stable launch. The software, based on Android 15, is expected to arrive alongside or near the launch of the Galaxy S25 series in January.</p>

<ul><li>Vivo’s mixed-reality team has supposedly reached over 500 members and the company is going all-in on a new headset.</li><li>At an event Dec. 31, the company revealed plans to prototype a mixed-realty headset with features that could surpass Apple Vision Pro.</li><li>The headset is said to deliver “high-fidelity prototype experiences” in a few cities in late 2025, but there’s no word on when a Vivo headset would be available for purchase.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The race to build the best mixed-reality headsets is heating up, and we’re starting to see just as many cryptic, unreleased prototypes as widely-available products. The market will gain one more prototype in 2025, as Vivo announced plans to reveal a mixed-reality headset late next year at an event Dec. 31, 2024. Vivo has lofty goals for the headset, and wants to dethrone Apple Vision Pro in a few areas, according to information relayed by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5117293942543312" target="_blank">Digital Chat Station</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/vivo_will_unveil_a_mixed_reality_headset_next_year-news-65904.php" target="_blank">GSMArena</a>).</p><p>Aside from a generic teaser image, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-takes-things-to-a-whole-new-level-with-the-x200-series">Vivo</a> didn’t share any details about its future headset. An unveiling is slated for next fall, sometime in September and October. At this stage, Vivo’s mixed-reality headset will almost certainly be a prototype. In fact, Vivo says that it expects to offer “high-fidelity prototype experiences" with its headset in select Chinese cities by the end of 2025.</p><p>Of course, aside from a confident pledge that Vivo’s mixed-reality headset will top <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/apple-vision-pro-launch-sales-success">Apple Vision Pro</a>, Vivo doesn’t have anything to share about how it will achieve that goal. Vision Pro, while considered a commercial failure by Apple’s usual standards, is still lauded for its impressive hardware and feature set. That’s likely why Vivo is targeting Vision Pro, especially in its home country of China.</p><p>It is worth noting that Vision Pro, released in February 2024, will be well over a year old when Vivo supposedly plans to best it with its own mixed-reality headset at the tail end of 2025.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="dNhxa3KRfjRfNt5ZJdBeb3" name="Apple-Vision-Pro-Viva-Tech-demo.jpg" alt="Using the Apple Vision Pro at Viva Tech 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dNhxa3KRfjRfNt5ZJdBeb3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2295" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Vivo wants to outdo Apple Vision Pro, the headset worn in the photo above.  </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Although the company gave us a general idea of when a prototype Vivo headset will be revealed, there’s no word yet on pricing or general availability. It isn’t the only company to tease a mixed-reality product you can’t buy yet — and likely won’t be able to for a long time. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Meta teased Orion earlier this year</a>, a pair of MR glasses too expensive to mass produce. More recently, Samsung showed off <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Project Moohan</a>, which will be the first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr-vs-meta-horizon-os">Android XR</a> headset to debut next year.</p><p>Being that so little is known about the Vivo headset, it’s probably best to approach it with a bit of skepticism. Pricing and availability have been huge barriers to mixed-reality tech to date. Meta’s Quest headsets are affordable but not necessarily top-tier, while Apple Vision Pro has great hardware and costs a fortune. It’s unclear where Vivo will fall, or if it’ll be somewhere in the middle.</p>

<hr>
<p>Ahead of the OnePlus 13R's official launch, set for Jan. 7, 2025, a massive leak revealed renders showing every angle of the upcoming midranger. The images were shared by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MysteryLupin" target="_blank">Arsène Lupin on X (formerly Twitter)</a> and show off what appear to be the only two OnePlus 13R colorways (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/oneplus_13r_leaked_renders_show_both_colorways_in_detail-news-65905.php" target="_blank">GSMArena</a>). While the official names of each color option aren't known, they look like versions of silver and space gray.</p><p>OnePlus has been teasing the OnePlus 13R for a few weeks now, and revealed some information about the device. However, we don't know as much about the OnePlus 13R as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a>, which is already available in China. Instead, the OnePlus 13R is likely to be a global rendition of the OnePlus Ace 5. With that being said, some already-known differences — like the smaller battery capacity — prove that the OnePlus 13R isn't a perfect rebrand of the Ace 5.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">13R pic.twitter.com/Svo524o8at<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1873695192198664574">December 30, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Previously, OnePlus only shared a cryptic, zoomed image of the OnePlus 13R's camera bump and rear chassis. This is the first time we've seen a complete look of the OnePlus 13R, if these leaked renders are indeed accurate. It represents a significant design change for OnePlus' midrange phone. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a> had a slim, curved design language that has been ditched for a boxy and rectangular look.</p><p>The display and back panel both appear to be flat, marking a long-overdue shift from OnePlus' curved screens. The entire smartphone market is moving in this direction, with Samsung, Google, and Apple, all releasing phones with a rectangular chassis.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">pic.twitter.com/BYWFhUc1gS<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1873695720462795156">December 30, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Otherwise, the OnePlus 13R looks like it'll keep a few OnePlus staples — as expected. For starters, there's the circular camera bump and the etched OnePlus logo on the back. You also get the OnePlus alert slider and a physical SIM card tray.</p><p>Beyond these leaks, OnePlus has already confirmed that the OnePlus 13R will feature a thin form factor and a 6,000mAh battery capacity. Additionally, an early Amazon listing revealed it'll be powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset</a>. To learn more about the OnePlus 13R, you'll need to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-oneplus-13r-is-a-thin-midranger-with-a-6-000mah-battery-arriving-january-7">tune into the Jan. 7, 2025 launch event</a>.</p>

I particularly found it interesting that during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, there were many people who were clicking on our deals for a Chromebook. Perhaps it really was an upgrade year! <br><br>That being said, Samsung outperformed everyone with a double whammy, releasing the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus and the Samsung Galaxy S10 Ultra. Samsung took both slots as Best Chromebook and Tablet of the Year and we congratulate you wholeheartedly!!</p><p>But you don't have to hear from me, I think it goes without saying that our resident Chromebook and Tablet expert Andrew Myrick says it all, here's what he has to say.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-chromebook-samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus"><span>Best Chromebook: Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="95c9nStgqwKfiDgrYRVQw3" name="samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review-14.jpg" alt="Empty desktop on the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/95c9nStgqwKfiDgrYRVQw3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Andrew Myrick:</strong> Not many of us had Samsung releasing a Chromebook on our "2024 Bingo Cards," yet here we are with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review">Galaxy Chromebook Plus</a>. Considering that it's been about three years since the last Samsung Chromebook was released, this latest offering makes a splash in a few different ways.</p><p>For one, the Galaxy Chromebook Plus is the thinnest 15.6-inch Chromebook that's ever been released. With that, it weighs just 2.58 pounds, making it one of the lighter laptops out there, and not just in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebook category</a>. Not to mention that Samsung still managed to squeeze a bunch of ports into this beast, including a full-size HDMI port and even a microSD Card slot.</p><p>Outside of the screen and design, the Galaxy Chromebook Plus was the first Chromebook to be released with the new "Quick Insert Key." This is Google's way of trying to make it easier to use and interact with Gemini in various ways. The best part is that the Quick Insert Key can be used across the entirety of ChromeOS and isn't just limited to Google's own apps.</p><p><strong>Runner-up:</strong> Lenovo Flex 5i Chromebook Plus</p><p>Without naming any names, there was one member of the Android Central staff who voted for something other than the Galaxy Chromebook Plus. So with that, Lenovo's Flex 5i Chromebook Plus makes it onto the podium, but it's not just for the sake of avoiding a Samsung sweep.</p><p>The Flex 5i Chromebook Plus is a fantastic device in its own right, arguably offering better versatility than the Galaxy Chromebook Plus. In addition to the included AI features and all-day battery life, the Flex 5i also sports a convertible design, complete with a touchscreen display — two things that you won't find on Samsung's latest Chromebook.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-android-tablet-samsung-galaxy-s10-ultra"><span>Best Android tablet: Samsung Galaxy S10 Ultra</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6j72Dx7E2yDydzZ2tjwR4c" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-with-keyboard-case-1.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra in Book Cover Keyboard case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6j72Dx7E2yDydzZ2tjwR4c.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Andrew Myrick: </strong>Without burying the lede, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra</a> is the staff's pick for best tablet of the year. However, it's not quite as clear-cut of a victory compared to years past. Functionally speaking, the Tab S10 Ultra is still probably the closest you'll get to being a true laptop replacement, thanks to its massive 14.6-inch display.</p><p>All of the regular bells and whistles are on board, such as the included S Pen in the box, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-samsung-dex">Samsung DeX</a>, and, of course, there's plenty of AI to go around. Samsung even kept the design practically identical to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-ultra-review">Tab S9 Ultra</a>, meaning that you don't need to run out and buy a new case if you want to upgrade.</p><p>However, this is the first time in years that Samsung's flagship tablet hasn't been powered by a Qualcomm chip. Instead, Samsung opted for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediateks-new-dimensity-9300-chip-brings-higher-clock-speeds-and-better-ai-processing">MediaTek Dimensity 9300 Plus</a>, which is quite impressive, but the decision does leave us scratching our heads a bit.</p><p><strong>Runner-up:</strong> OnePlus Pad 2, RedMagic Nova Gaming Tablet</p><p>As for the runner-up, well, there are actually two. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-2-review">OnePlus Pad 2</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/nubias-new-gaming-tablet-crushes-the-competition-with-a-premium-chipset-and-built-in-fan">RedMagic Nova Gaming Tablet</a> tied for second place. Unlike Samsung's offering, both of these tablets are powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 but take very different approaches.</p><p>The OnePlus Pad 2 is more of a refinement over the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-review">OnePlus Pad</a>, with most of the "drastic" changes coming via the software. Released alongside the Pad 2 are the OnePlus Pad Smart Keyboard and Stylo 2. The obvious goal is to offer a portable productivity powerhouse, especially when paired with a OnePlus phone.</p><p>When it comes to the RedMagic Nova Gaming Tablet, the premise is right in the name. RedMagic is becoming synonymous with gaming, catering to a niche that just wants the fastest and most powerful devices possible. And that's exactly what you get from the Nova Gaming Tablet, at least until the first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> tablets start to arrive.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I'm going to be honest here, I didn't really know much about XR or Smart Glasses, until I had to edit and follow the work of my incredibly knowledgeable colleague Nick Sutrich. <br><br>Through reading his extensive coverage of the world of XR and Smart Glasses, it's been a lot easier for me to understand how important these two categories have become in the world of Android. And especially with the big announcement that Google and Samsung will launch Android XR as a Meta Quest competitor next year, this mixed-reality space is only going to get more exciting.</p><p>For now, congrats to Meta for the Meta Quest 3S, and Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, and for the best games, we have Batman: Arkham Shadow and Just Dance! <br><br>Here's what Nick had to say.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-xr-headset-or-smart-glasses-meta-quest-3s"><span>Best XR headset or smart glasses: Meta Quest 3S</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="VmhgPSSJMmbqhSEKmJkgyS" name="Meta-Quest-3S-with-controllers" alt="A Meta Quest 3S headset with both of its included controllers" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VmhgPSSJMmbqhSEKmJkgyS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Nick Sutrich:</strong> The XR industry continued to grow during 2024, and a few devices have helped attract new users, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-review" target="_blank">Meta Quest 3S</a>. Meta’s latest headset is our XR device of the year because it delivers unparalleled value in the space, helping to bring in new users and give Quest 2 users an easy upgrade path without spending a ton of money. It might have the Quest 2’s lenses and display, but everything else is a massive upgrade, including the next-gen Snapdragon chipset inside.</p><p>Not only that, but Meta included Batman: Arkham Shadow for free with every Meta Quest 3S, further enticing new users into the fold with a series they know and love. For $299, Meta somehow included almost everything that makes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Quest 3</a> a fantastic experience, including the new controllers with better haptics and full-color, high-resolution passthrough vision. It’s created an explosion of fantastic mixed reality games, and it’s going to help usher in a new wave of next-gen VR games in 2025 and beyond.</p><p><strong>Runner-up:</strong> Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses</p><p>While these technically came out in 2023, Meta basically relaunched the entire product category with the introduction of Meta AI tools on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses</a> back in April. Further updates were launched in September, including live translation and other impressive multimodal AI features right from your face. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-glasses-just-got-their-most-futuristic-ai-update-yet">Live AI</a> and music recognition, among other features, were added just a few days ago, showing that Meta is all about keeping these glasses as useful and relevant as possible.</p><p>Of course, all the base perks of the glasses from last year still stand. They’re a relatively affordable pair of frames with support for nearly all prescription types. I love wearing mine as a replacement for earbuds more often than not, and they’re mind-blowingly handy for taking phone calls, snapping quick pictures or videos (hands-free!), or just listening and responding to messages without having to stare at your phone.</p>

<p><strong>Nick Sutrich:</strong> This year has been a stupendous year for VR gaming, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/batman-arkham-shadow-review">Batman: Arkham Shadow</a> shines even among the crowded room for its excellence in game design, storytelling, voice acting, and unique gameplay mechanics that perfectly translate the Arkham experience to Meta Quest 3 headsets. Batman: Arkham Shadow takes home our 2024 VR single-player game of the year award.</p><p>Arkham Shadow’s original story takes place between Arkham Origins and Arkham Asylum, letting you explore the Blackgate Prison in a way never before seen in a Batman game. You’ll switch between two characters throughout the story to undercover the identity behind the Rat King and experience the most authentic way to feel what Batman feels: by donning the cowl, your unofficial detective badge, and a license to beat up anyone who’s had it coming.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-new-multi-player-vr-game-just-dance-vr-welcome-to-dancity"><span>Best new multi-player VR game: Just Dance VR – Welcome to Dancity</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="D2ZpsvRmjhye4dhBop2kmE" name="Just-Dance-VR" alt="Screenshot of Just Dance VR" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/D2ZpsvRmjhye4dhBop2kmE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1440" height="810" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ubisoft)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Nick Sutrich:</strong> The long-awaited VR entry into the storied Just Dance series is the best way to learn the moves you’ve always wanted to, all to your favorite songs of the day. But we’ve been there and done that for the past 15 years with the series, so why did it get our 2024 VR multiplayer game of the year award? Because of Dancity.</p><p>Ubisoft and co-developer Soul Assembly put together a brilliant way to not only play and dance with friends but also to hang out with them in a spectacular “metaverse” style world called Dancity. It makes the game come alive in ways the series has never done before, and it makes playing the multiplayer component not only feel unique but also like a cohesive experience that we simply didn’t expect from a rhythm game.</p><p>Check out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/just-dance-vr-welcome-to-dancity/6646371635430939/">Just Dance VR – Welcome to Dancity</a> today!</p>

<ul><li>Two new Samsung devices have already passed through the GSMA database.</li><li>The first is the Galaxy Z Flip FE, carrying a model number of SM-F761B.</li><li>The other is the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic with a model number of SM-L505U.</li></ul>
<p>While foldable phones have seen their ups and downs, many have been wondering if Samsung would give its offerings the "Fan Edition (FE)" treatment. Usually, when there's a new Galaxy FE device, this means that it's a bit more budget-friendly compared to its non-FE counterparts.</p><p>It seems that Samsung is already gearing up for its next lineup of foldable phones, as the "Galaxy Z Flip XE" was spotted in the GSMA database (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/exclusive-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-fe-and-galaxy-watch8-classic-in-the-works/">SmartPrix</a>.) If you were hoping for this listing to share any specifics, you're a bit out of luck. However, the database listing does seem to confirm the model number of SM-F761B.</p><p>Samsung has been rumored to be looking into releasing a cheaper foldable phone. In late November, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-next-galaxy-z-flip-might-have-a-surprise-processor">rumors suggested</a> Samsung would release the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE alongside the Flip 7 and Fold 7, while being powered by the Exynos 2400e.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="muLAZxgnWdWVKXRtcCm2bH" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-Flex-Mode-Panel.jpg" alt="Galaxy Z Flip 6 Flex Mode Panel with Instagram running" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/muLAZxgnWdWVKXRtcCm2bH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is the same chip found in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-hands-on">Galaxy S24 FE</a>, offering solid performance while offering Samsung a way to come in at a lower cost. Meanwhile, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> is said to be powered by the Exynos 2500, which has yet to be officially announced.</p><p>Recently, a report surfaced suggesting that Samsung is drastically lowering sales expectations for its 2025 foldable phones. The company is reportedly planning to sell five million units, with the Flip 7 accounting for three million, and the Fold 7 covering the rest. That being said, this most recent report doesn't take into account the possible release of the Flip 7 FE.</p><p>That being said, Samsung's summer 2025 launch event might have a bit more than just a new foldable phone. Actually, the company could end up bringing back a fan favorite, but not in the form of the Fan Edition.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="zf4zp3Q9kXJw3piCVVngMk" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-7-vs-Ultra-6.jpeg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 (left, silver) and Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra (right, black) side-by-side" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zf4zp3Q9kXJw3piCVVngMk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>SmartPrix found another unannounced Samsung device in the GSMA database. The Galaxy Watch 8 Classic and its SM-L505U model number also made an appearance.</p><p>This is particularly interesting as there was no "Classic" included with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a> lineup. Instead, Samsung opted for the Watch 7 in two sizes, with the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> launching alongside.</p><p>The main distinction between the "regular" Watch and the Watch Classic is the physical rotating bezel. While Samsung has been offering a touch-sensitive bezel on the Watch for a few years, it's still not quite as reliable as having the physical option.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Nmj9QzsAtKafiFf76tzvDH" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-6-Classic-bezel.jpeg" alt="A close-up side-view of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic, focused on the rotating bezel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Nmj9QzsAtKafiFf76tzvDH.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At this point, it feels as though Samsung is taking an "on again, off again" approach with the Classic. So from that perspective, it makes sense for this to be an option with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8</a>, but there are some who wish Samsung would just keep this as part of the yearly refresh.</p><p>Before getting too excited about a shift to an earlier release schedule, it's not uncommon for unannounced devices to pass through these kinds of databases early. With that in mind, we don't expect any official announcement until sometime in the summer of 2025.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung appears to be including a crash detection virtual sensor on the upcoming Galaxy S25 series.</li><li>Although similar or identical sensors have appeared on prior Samsung devices, the company hasn't rolled out a feature making use of them.</li><li>It's still unclear whether Samsung plans to introduce a car crash detection feature on the Galaxy S25 series or with One UI 7.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung might finally catch up to Apple and Google by including a critical safety feature on the upcoming Galaxy S25 series. According to a report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s25-car-crash-detection-sensor-3511840/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, leaked code strings from the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra reveal that the company will once again include a virtual car crash sensor. It's worth noting that although past Galaxy phones have included a similar or identical sensor, Samsung hasn't released a car crash detection feature yet.</p><p>The leaked files mention a <strong>Car Crash Detect Wakeup</strong> sensor, which is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a> sensor of the same name as ones previously spotted on the Galaxy S24 series and select Samsung foldables. This sensor is not a single hardware sensor in the traditional sense. Instead, it's a virtual sensor that compiles data from multiple hardware sensors in an effort to detect when a car crash has occurred.</p><p>Being that Samsung keeps including the Car Crash Detect Wakeup sensor, it appears that the company is still working on bringing a car crash detection feature to Galaxy phones. The brand is clearly behind the curve. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-enable-car-crash-detection-pixel">Google added a car crash detection feature to Pixel phones</a> way back and 2019 and Apple followed suit in 2022.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="G2jTwQ3PkYe4RjaFE8FhMm" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-white-back-01.jpg" alt="Looking at the different colorways of the Samsung Galaxy S24" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/G2jTwQ3PkYe4RjaFE8FhMm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>However, as Android Authority notes, this isn't a guarantee that a working feature will be available on the Galaxy S25 series. There have been code strings and hidden system apps hinting at car crash detection since as early as 2023, but a public and working feature has not been made available yet. Sometimes, these safety features are region locked, but there's no evidence of car crash detection being available on Samsung devices in any region.</p><p>The good news is that, theoretically, the virtual sensor's inclusion in the Galaxy S25 series codebase means Samsung's upcoming flagships will get car crash detection whenever it becomes available as part of One UI. At the moment, it's not available in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a>.</p>

However, it might not be long before even more major announcements are made, Gemini will be at the forefront for most of it.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/27/google-ceo-pichai-tells-employees-the-stakes-are-high-for-2025.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CNBC</a>, Google held a "2025 strategy meeting" in mid-December, where Google CEO Sundar Pichai and other Google executives laid out expectations for the coming years. Pichai even went so far as to say that "the stakes are high" and that "2025 will be critical."</p><p>This comes following a barrage of court trials, some of which are related to Google's advertisement practices, and another that could see <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-files-counter-doj-chrome-proposal">Chrome</a> and Android needing to be sold. All the while, Google continues to invest heavily into Gemini, with Pichai stating that "scaling Gemini on the consumer side will be our biggest focus next year."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WK7yDjQB2kjcz6MAYd2y4C" name="Gemini-2.0" alt="The Gemini 2.0 graphic provided by Google." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WK7yDjQB2kjcz6MAYd2y4C.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/looking-at-the-mobile-tech-market-in-2025">past month alone</a>, Google has introduced quite a few updates to Gemini. These include things such as the Deep Research feature, which is touted as "your personal AI research assistant," and is already available. At the same time, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-advanced-feature-expands-to-more-languages-and-regions">Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental</a> was announced, providing an updated AI model supporting multimodal inputs, while outperforming Gemini 1.5 Pro "on key benchmarks, at twice the speed."</p><p>A goal within Google is for Gemini to become the company's "next app to reach half a billion users." However, Pichai confirmed that there are some challenges ahead, and expects "some back and forth." Ultimately, Pichai believes that Gemini can lead the industry while stating "In history, you don't always need to be first but you have to execute well and really be the best in class as a product."</p><p>From there, Demis Hassabis, co-founder of DeepMind, claimed that "the products themselves are going to evolve massively over the next year or two." Hassabis went on to provide a bit of a goal, aiming for "a universal assistant that can seamlessly operate over any domain, any modality or any device."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1050px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:50.19%;"><img id="scrkicTkF2C4mLg9diudmP" name="google-project-astra-enters-signup-phase" alt="Google's Project Astra lets testers point their cameras at items within its app to receive information about it." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/scrkicTkF2C4mLg9diudmP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1050" height="527" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>And if you're wondering where <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-project-astra-ar-waitlist-opens-trusted-testers">Project Astra</a> stands in all of this, Hassabis shared that it "will be updated in the first half of the year." In early December, Google made it possible to sign up for the "trusted tester waitlist," however, the floodgates have not been opened just yet.</p><p>As if there wasn't enough pressure from various government agencies, Google is also feeling the pressure from OpenAI. The AI giant recently concluded its "12 days of ship-mas," where a variety of new features were introduced. Arguably the biggest of which was Sora, which lets you create AI-generated videos using nothing more than a text prompt.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="UxkEjFyJ7VMwPGcRaYjtgP" name="ChatGPT-hero.jpg" alt="ChatGPT conversation screen on a smartphone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UxkEjFyJ7VMwPGcRaYjtgP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1800" height="1012" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Not only that, but OpenAI also announced some major improvements to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/openai-chatgpt-search-feature-rollout">ChatGPT Search</a>, clearly setting Google in its sights. And not to be outdone by Gemini 2.0, OpenAI revealed its o3 and o3 mini AI models, which are said to offer a substantial improvement over the previous o1 and o1 mini models.</p><p>However, OpenAI also recently introduced ChatGPT Pro, a new subscription priced at $200 per month. By signing up, you are provided "with the highest level of access," including unlimited access to GPT-4o, o1, and advanced voice.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Sge3x7PigWQGRRhrfz2HXf" name="chatgpt-pricing-12-2024" alt="ChatGPT Subscription plans as of December 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Sge3x7PigWQGRRhrfz2HXf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OpenAI)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is one area of concern for everyone who's even tangentially interested in the future of AI, including whether Google plans to charge similar prices to access Gemini. In the meeting, Hassabis reportedly responded by saying "Right now, we don't have any plans for this kind of subscription level." Of course, there's nothing to say that this couldn't change tomorrow, but it does offer a bit of reprieve if you have concerns.</p><p>Providing a roadmap for what it expects to achieve in 2025 is just one piece of the puzzle. It's even more important to follow through, reach, and maybe even surpass those goals. Needless to say, it'll be quite interesting to see how everything plays out over the course of the next 12 months.</p>

<ul><li>A leak sheds some light on what to expect from the OnePlus Open 2.</li><li>Some of the expected improvements include an IPX8 rating, wireless charging, and a larger battery.</li><li>The Open 2 is said to be a rebranded Oppo Find N5, and will see a "global release in late Q1 2025."</li></ul>
<p>After OnePlus and parent company Oppo made the curious decision to forego a new foldable phone in 2024, it appears that won't be the case for 2025. A new leak from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/exclusive-oneplus-open-2-first-look/">SmartPrix</a> shares a couple of renders for the OnePlus Open 2, while also revealing some of the key improvements we can expect to see.</p><p>According to the provided renders, it appears that the OnePlus Open 2 will largely retain the same design as its predecessor. This includes the round and massive rear camera module, housing a triple-lens setup. It's expected to be headlined by a 50MP main lens, while also including a 50MP ultrawide lens and a 50MP telephoto sensor with 3x optical zoom.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="yTZcKqiZRTr9mRmHka5vG4" name="oneplus-open-2-rear-camera-smartprix-leak" alt="OnePlus Open 2 rear camera leak from SmartPrix" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yTZcKqiZRTr9mRmHka5vG4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="2560" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: SmartPrix)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For the most part, the rumored specs are what we expected, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> powering the Open 2. SmartPrix claims OnePlus will pair this chip with 16GB of RAM and "a generous 1TB of storage." It's unclear whether this will be the only configuration available, or if the OnePlus Open 2 will also come with 512GB of storage.</p><p>As for the displays, we're expecting a 6.4-inch AMOLED Cover Screen, which is slightly larger compared to the original Open (6.31-inch.) This isn't the only difference to be found, as OnePlus is also rumored to use a larger 8-inch LTPO inner screen with a 2K resolution, and 120Hz refresh rate.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="W2qi2EFZjWXrttheoT7jP4" name="oneplus-open-2-inner-screen-smartprix-leak" alt="OnePlus Open 2 inner display leak from SmartPrix" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/W2qi2EFZjWXrttheoT7jP4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2000" height="2000" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: SmartPrix)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Keeping with the idea of "bigger, faster, better," these latest rumors suggest OnePlus will introduce a larger 5,900mAh battery. This offers a massive improvement over the 4,800mAh cell from its predecessor. Speaking of which, the lack of wireless charging was a sticking point for some, but that won't be the case with the Open 2. In addition to the 80W wired charging speeds, the Open 2 is expected to also offer up to 50W wireless charging.</p><p>That's not all that SmartPrix had to share, as the Open 2 is said to "measure just under 10mm thin." The exact dimensions weren't provided, but if this comes to fruition, it would be even thinner than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-fold-changed-my-mind-about-foldables-but-i-still-prefer-flip-phones">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> (10.5mm when folded.) Lastly, the Open 2 is expected to offer better water resistance with an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-2-resistance-rating-camera-specs-tipped">IPX8 rating</a>, an improvement over the IPX4 from the previous model.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="gGwJinCDt8GHZCH2xckc8o" name="samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review-22.jpg" alt="Comparing the thickness between the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus, Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gGwJinCDt8GHZCH2xckc8o.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As expected, the Open 2 will essentially be a rebranded Oppo Find N5, as with the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> and Find N4. The Find N5 is said to arrive "in China early next year, followed by a global release in late Q1 2025." SmartPrix goes on to say that the launch of the Open 2 will likely coincide with that of the Find N5.</p><p>If everything goes according to plan, the OnePlus Open 2 and Oppo Find N5 could be the first two <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> released in 2025. However, there's always a chance that issues crop up, delaying one of the most highly anticipated new phone releases.</p>

The Watch FE was too downgraded, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Watch 7</a> a bit too safe and same-y, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Watch Ultra</a> too expensive for anyone besides me to have tried, no matter how excellent it was.</p><p>Instead, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> was the overwhelming favorite, a fast, decently long-lasting smartwatch with improved running tools for couch-to-5Kers. It was one of my favorite reviews of the year, and many of my colleagues ditched their old watches for a Watch 3 this year.</p><p>I think most people were happy to finally have a larger display with a smaller bezel — not to mention the doubled brightness and smoother refresh rate — but I think our collective excitement came down to the Watch 3 still feeling fresh. People prefer its soft-edged, striking style to the Galaxy Watch’s flat, unchanged look, even if it’s more durable. And as a bunch of Google power users, they’re most excited by new Google Home integrations that make the Watch 3 interconnected with their other devices.</p><p><strong>Runner-up:</strong> OnePlus Watch 2R</p><p>The more competitive battle was for the runner-up slot. The Galaxy Watch 7 got a couple of votes, while Garmin spread out its votes among different options. But a dark horse swooped in: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2r-review">OnePlus Watch 2R</a>, which I also gave a strong review. In this case, it’s the clear inverse of the Pixel Watch 3: not very attractive or strong for health insights, but much more affordable, far stronger for battery life, and just as fast for overall performance. It’s the mid-priced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watch</a> we’ve been waiting for.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-smart-ring-oura-ring-4"><span>Best smart ring: Oura Ring 4</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2sq9v3PBhKKwpjmEkYARNX" name="Oura-Ring-4-review-09.jpg" alt="The Oura Ring 4 with the Android Bot figure" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2sq9v3PBhKKwpjmEkYARNX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Derrek Lee: </strong>Smart rings are still a growing market, but Oura has proven that there’s plenty of merit in the form factor. The arrival of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-review">Oura Ring 4</a>, along with a slew of new contenders, big and small, shows that consumers are interested. At first glance, Oura’s latest model may not look like a huge upgrade from its predecessor, but the company has made some significant changes to enhance the overall experience while improving accuracy and battery life.</p><p>The Oura Ring 4 refines the design for a more comfortable and durable fit, making it perfect to wear while sleeping in case you don’t like to wear your smartwatch to bed. However, the updated design isn’t just cosmetic; the flush sensors are arranged in such a way that readings should be more accurate with more pathways between sensors.</p><p>This is aided by Oura’s new Smart Sensing technology, which not only improves the ring’s health tracking but also extends battery life. And with the updated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/can-oura-ring-4-automatically-detect-workouts">automatic activity tracking</a>, the ring not only detects workouts like running, biking, HIIT, and yoga, but it will also automatically monitor your heart rate when it does, so you don’t have to manually track workouts for more comprehensive data.</p><p><strong>Runner-up:</strong> Ultrahuman Ring Air</p><p>There are plenty of impressive smart rings in the market, but the runner-up on our list is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-review">Ultrahuman Ring Air</a>, which has been giving Oura a run for its money in more ways than one. It has a comfortable fit and comes with great sleep-tracking features. And like Oura, Ultrahuman has also been adding new features to its ring, even some you can’t find on the Oura Ring, like this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/why-dont-more-smartwatches-use-this-smart-rings-seemingly-obvious-trick">cool new smart alarm</a>. And the best part is that, unlike Oura, there’s no subscription to use its most useful features.</p>

Google’s Pixel 9 Pro was hands down the best Android phone this year. With its seamless Gemini integration, beautiful design, and amazing features, it truly was the phone that beat all phones this year.</p><p>We can’t discount the OnePlus 12 because not only was it a great phone, but it also helped Android Central determine that OnePlus really has been the most improved Android brand of the year.</p><p>I think what shocked me the most was that there weren’t that many great foldable releases from Google or Samsung, and most of the better foldable phones this year came from brands outside of the U.S. Honor’s Magic V3 clearly made the best foldable this year. Of course, the phone that consistently impresses me is the Razr Plus 2024, which was this year's best flip phone winner. <br><br>Here's what some of my colleagues have to say about the winners. Congratulations!</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-android-phone-google-pixel-9-pro"><span>Best Android phone: Google Pixel 9 Pro</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JaJqwiBjS57HpxKCJecRSJ" name="Android Central Best of 2024" alt="OnePlus 12 next to Pixel 9 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JaJqwiBjS57HpxKCJecRSJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Nick Sutrich: </strong>In a sea of phones that feel similar, Google has done a monumental job of making a phone that feels different — even if it looks a little too much like an iPhone on the outside for some of us. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro</a> is Android Central’s favorite phone of the year because of its ability to pack the best of the Pixel 9 Pro XL in a smaller body, including the killer triple rear cameras that used to only come on the biggest and most expensive Pixel phones.</p><p>Not only that, but Google’s ability to use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> at the core of the Pixel experience to differentiate it from the pack is something to celebrate. Great new apps like Pixel Screenshots are game changers for what Google does best — search — while improvements to the overall interface and user experience with useful AI features made this the favorite of most Android Central staff.</p><p>It might not have received the highest score of all the premium phones we reviewed this year, but there’s something special about the Pixel 9 Pro that kept us coming back and wanting more despite the faults we found with it.</p><p><strong>Runner-up:</strong> OnePlus 12</p><p>Our runner-up is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a>. I’ll admit it: I haven’t cared about a OnePlus phone in years, and based on the numbers, most of you haven’t either. But the OnePlus 12 changed all that, and it not only got people talking about the brand again, but it also got them to start buying <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">OnePlus phones</a> again.</p><p>Everything about this phone exhibits the best of OnePlus. From feature-rich software that’s blazing fast and smoother than any other phone to stupidly fast charging that gets you a top-up in minutes and even one of the most eye-friendly OLEDs in the business, it’s nearly impossible not to love the OnePlus 12. That makes it our runner-up for best phone of the year.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-value-phone-google-pixel-8a"><span>Best value phone: Google Pixel 8a</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PuWJAtnvr8uYPKVpSrWtUJ" name="Android Central Best of 2024" alt="OnePlus 12R next to Pixel 8a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PuWJAtnvr8uYPKVpSrWtUJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Harish Jonnalagadda:</strong> It should come as no surprise that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a> is the best mid-range phone of 2024. It continues to have the best cameras in this category, and Google did a great job with the design this time — if anything, I prefer it to the Pixel 9 Pro in this regard. While the camera modules aren't the latest, Google excels at eking out the best possible photos and videos; there are other phones that come close to the Pixel 8a, but none can meet its consistency.</p><p>Google also made positive strides with the OLED panel, and it now goes up to 120Hz and gets significantly brighter even under harsh sunlight. These are all positive improvements, but it's the software that makes the Pixel 8a truly stand out — it is the only mid-range phone with a clean interface and long-term update guarantee. With Google promising <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-many-updates-will-the-pixel-8a-receive">seven years of Android OS updates</a>, it will stay relevant until 2031, which isn't the case with any other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">affordable Android phone</a>.</p><p><strong>Runner-up:</strong> OnePlus 12R</p><p>Coming in second is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a>. OnePlus decided to sell the phone globally starting this year, and that ultimately turned out to be the right call; the phone has the best hardware package in this segment, and although I still give the edge to the Pixel 8a because of its software, the 12R is much better at gaming, has a bigger battery, and unmatched fast charging tech.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-camera-phone-vivo-x100-series"><span>Best camera phone: Vivo X100 series</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="hyet8kTDnvDvroVXqHRHoQ" name="vivo-x100-ultra-26.jpg" alt="Vivo X100 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hyet8kTDnvDvroVXqHRHoQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Nick Sutrich: </strong>Android Central staff voted on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-camera">best phone camera</a> of the year, but the results weren’t even close. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-ultra-long-term-review" target="_blank">Vivo X100</a> series took home 14 of our 20 total votes, and it’s no surprise, given how effectively the phone can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/replacing-my-dslr-with-vivo-x100-pro">replace a DSLR-style camera</a> in most situations. Vivo’s software is extremely user-friendly yet offers powerful options for folks who need it to do more than they might expect from a phone.</p><p>My favorite part of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-pro-review">Vivo experience</a> is the convincing portrait-style photos the phone creates from nearly any zoom level and with any subject. Taking photos of your food is suddenly transformed into a magazine-quality experience, and everything from group photos to landscape shots is simply stunning thanks to the phone’s accurate colors, crisp details, and ability to capture motion without that telltale smartphone blur.</p><p><strong>Runner-up:</strong> Google Pixel 9 Pro</p><p>The runner-up is no surprise because Google Pixel phones typically win the best camera in any given year. The Google Pixel 9 Pro is the best camera you can buy in the U.S., without a doubt. Google’s photo quality is always top-notch, and it is one of the most reliable camera phones you can use. When you take a photo with a Pixel, there’s almost never a time it’s not a good photo.</p><p>Google ramped things up a notch this year with awesome new features like Add Me, which help get the photographer in the group shot by cleverly using AI to stitch two pictures together. Thanks to some excellent UI design and features that are consistently fun to use, the Pixel 9 Pro is the camera phone to get if you can’t get a Vivo X100.</p>

<p><strong>Andrew Myrick:</strong> Well, wouldn't you know it? Neither Samsung nor Google will take home the "best foldable phone" crown in 2024. Instead, it's the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review">Honor Magic V3</a> that continues to turn heads and impress despite not even being available in North America.</p><p>The Magic V3 packs a punch in all the right ways, starting with a design that is both incredibly sleek and light. As noted in our review, "The Galaxy S24 Ultra is 2g heavier than the Magic V3," which is just insane when you consider the V3 provides a 6.43-inch cover display and a 7.92-inch inner screen.</p><p>Honor made very few sacrifices with the Magic V3, with the biggest issue being the "average battery life." Besides that, we have flagship specs across the board, with the V3 being powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a>. Honor didn't skimp on the cameras either, with the array comprised of a 50MP main, 50MP periscope telephoto, and a 40MP ultrawide.</p><p><strong>Runner-up:</strong> Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold</p><p>Coming in second place was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>, which Google took in a completely unexpected direction. Instead of attempting to refine the passport style from the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a>, the 9 Pro Fold is more in line with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> and the aforementioned Honor Magic V3.</p><p>The Pixel 9 Pro Fold's cover screen is the same size as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a> while unfolding to reveal a beautiful 8-inch AMOLED display. It's powered by Google's latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a>, paired with 16GB of RAM and up to 512GB of storage. Even the battery life is fantastic, easily lasting for more than a day with regular use. We just really wish it had the same cameras as the Pixel 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4073px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Jd2WofGy5Vkrr4SVFvsnaS" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-review-hero-16-9.jpg" alt="The Motorola Razr Plus 2024 open at an angle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Jd2WofGy5Vkrr4SVFvsnaS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4073" height="2291" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Derrek Lee:</strong> Motorola has had something of a resurgence in recent years. While Samsung’s Galaxy Z Flip lineup has been pretty same-y for the past couple of generations, Motorola came out of left field with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2023-how-it-started-how-its-going">revamped Razr in 2023</a>, then gave it a pretty substantial upgrade in 2024.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Motorola Razr Plus 2024</a> is technically not the most powerful <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phone</a> on the market — that distinction goes to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> and its more powerful chipset — however, Motorola makes up for it in other ways, with the overall experience culminating in a phone that I haven’t wanted to put down since I got my hands on it. The design feels so refined with a strong hinge, IPX8 water resistance, and vegan leather on the back of every model.</p><p>I also have almost no complaints about the specs; the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8s-gen-3-announced">Snapdragon 8S Gen 3</a> and 12GB of RAM feel plenty speedy, the 4,000mAh battery doesn’t make me feel nervous, and the new 50MP primary camera takes photos that I can actually use. Plus, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-set-up-use-motorola-razr-cover-screen-apps">4-inch cover screen</a> is a blast to use, with access to nearly all of your apps.</p><p><strong>Runner-up:</strong> Xiaomi Mix Flip</p><p>While the Razr Plus 2024 won nearly unanimously, the runner-up was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-announces-mix-flip-and-mix-fold-4">Xiaomi Mix Flip</a>, which features a more powerful Snapdragon chipset and an equally large (although bigger by 0.01 inches) cover screen. As Xiaomi’s first flip phone, the Mix Flip is quite impressive, with a stunning design, a great set of Leica-powered cameras, and a shockingly large battery for a flip phone. The only problem is that the phone isn’t available in North America or Australia.</p>

<p><strong>Harish Jonnalagadda:</strong> OnePlus had a standout 2024, and the manufacturer didn't put a foot wrong in the last 12 months. The OnePlus Open is still one of the best foldables around, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-2-review">OnePlus Pad 2</a> is a terrific mid-range tablet, and the OnePlus 12R is a viable alternative to the Pixel 8a.</p><p>But it's the OnePlus 12 that's particularly notable. While OnePlus rolled out flagships for the better part of a decade, its earlier efforts couldn't quite measure up to what Samsung, Xiaomi, Vivo, and Google had to offer. That changed with the OnePlus 12, with the device <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-camera-impressions-why-it-replaced-my-pixel-9">delivering much better cameras</a>, a brighter AMOLED with eye-friendly tech, and class-leading battery life.</p><p>OnePlus managed to address several of its shortcomings this year, and the fact that it now has devices to take on the best flagships, as well as mid-range phones, makes it truly deserving of the moniker of the most improved brand of 2024.</p>

Last week, I looked back on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-2024-retrospective">Wear OS's strongest year yet</a> and promised that I'd share my predictions for what could happen with Android smartwatches in 2025. So here I am, bearing the promise of presents for loyal Wear OS users — and a couple of lumps of pessimistic coal.</p><p>I'm optimistic that 2025 will be a transformative year for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a>, building off of 2024's strong foundation and the long-awaited payoff of new Snapdragon hardware and Google's Gemini push.</p><p>That said, we can also see warning signs in what happened in 2024 that could lead to some angst for Android watch owners this year — depending on which brand you own. So good and bad, let's break down what we expect to see from Wear OS watches in 2025, both for hardware and software!</p>
<h2 id="new-snapdragon-hardware-and-a-swap-to-risc-v-2">New Snapdragon hardware (and a swap to RISC-V)</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="753wRPDvAPADLF554pLHz6" name="snapdragon-wear-01.jpg" alt="A Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear chip inside of a smartwatch with a bokeh background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/753wRPDvAPADLF554pLHz6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google, Mobvoi, OnePlus, and Xiaomi used the 2022 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/qualcomm-snapdragon-w5-platform-announcement">Snapdragon W5 Gen 1 SoC</a> in nearly all of their Wear OS watches over the last 2.5 years. Unlike annual smartphone chips, watches don't have an application like gaming that requires much headroom; these watches are speedy enough with 2GB of RAM and old silicon. Still, it's fair to expect an upgrade in 2025, as the latest Wear used a Cortex-A53 core first announced in 2012.</p><p>I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/qualcomms-next-wear-os-chipset-could-arrive-in-2025">interviewed Qualcomm VP Dino Bekis about Snapdragon Wear</a> in October, and he all but promised that they'd have a Snapdragon Wear chip announcement in 2025. While he offered no specifics about cores, he described it as a "feature-focused" and "AI-driven" chip that could "scale for multiple years" because it'll have enough compute capability to specialize in whatever tools OEMs want.</p><p>Assuming it follows Qualcomm's naming conventions, the Snapdragon W5 Gen 2 would probably power most Wear OS watches through 2027. It may use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/what-is-risc-v">RISC-V</a>, the open-source, energy-efficient platform with custom cores that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/snapdragon-wear-risc-v-upgrade">Qualcomm and Google first partnered on in 2023</a>.</p><p>Bekis said the two companies are still working on porting Wear OS software to RISC-V and that the transition could make Wear OS watches longer-lived, with "a week's worth of battery life" as the goal. I doubt we'll hit that anytime soon, but it's something to hope for.</p><p>Anshel Sag, principal analyst for Moor Insights & Strategy, called the potential RISC-V switch "extremely interesting," praising that they'd have cheaper custom chips specialized for the application and that it would "open the door" for new tools. He warned me that he "thinks RISC-V will still take a bit longer than anticipated," but "the payoff could be huge." That could lead Google into looking for alternatives for its Pixel Watch 4, if it's not ready by the 2025 deadline.</p>
<h2 id="google-faces-a-snapdragon-tensor-crossroads-2">Google faces a Snapdragon/Tensor crossroads</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="SUYun2bhF7fsxK5qmDnV5i" name="google-pixel-watch-3-google-tv-controls.jpg" alt="Google TV controls on Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SUYun2bhF7fsxK5qmDnV5i.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Do Wear OS apps need a fancy next-gen processor? Or is "Tensor" enough? </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You'd reasonably assume the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Pixel Watch 4</a> will use the Snapdragon W5 Gen 2, but one leak suggested <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/upcoming-pixel-watches-could-play-it-safe-and-i-dont-like-it">Google might play it safe</a> and develop a Tensor chip in-house that's essentially a lower-powered version of the Exynos W1000 in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a>, with a 2020 Cortex-A78 core and two Cortex-A55 cores.</p><p>Google's current Tensor strategy with <em>phones</em> is to focus more on in-house development (partnered with Samsung LSI) and powerful AI performance at the expense of benchmarked power. Google could take a similar approach with watches, deciding it doesn't <em>need</em> much headroom and putting more emphasis on a powerful NPU for Gemini tasks rather than pay Qualcomm a premium to license its Snapdragon chips.</p><p>Google's partnership with Samsung underpins Wear OS's success, and staying in lockstep would make joint software development easier. <em>Or</em> it'll go all-in on RISC-V to try and differentiate its Pixel family from Samsung's. I can only speculate on which path Google will take; I <em>hope</em> it chooses the latter, simply because it would make the Pixel Watch 4 in 2025 more intriguing, while also worrying that Google will take the safer route.</p>
<h2 id="health-and-fitness-will-remain-a-primary-focus-2">Health and fitness will remain a primary focus</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="t64tqjPgwPtjWuQ8AKC73b" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review-samsung-health-water-energy-score.jpg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 showing water monitoring and energy scores in Samsung Health" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/t64tqjPgwPtjWuQ8AKC73b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ara Wagoner / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is such a safe bet that I won't spend too long dwelling on it. However, Wear OS 6 will continue Google and Samsung's quest to try to keep up with fitness rivals like Apple and Garmin.</p><p>A healthy portion of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> and One UI 6 Watch updates focused on health features (e.g., sleep apnea / Energy Score / Cardio Load) and workout tools (e.g., AI coaching / running form analysis / pace or HR goals during workouts).</p><p>With Wear OS 6 watches, Google will hopefully add dual-band GPS like Samsung, as well as focus on other sports like cycling and weightlifting to complement its newfound running focus. Samsung will probably copy Google and Apple and implement some form of training load feature, showing the short- and long-term impact of workouts.</p><p>We could also see new health tools, but I'll remain skeptical of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-explores-non-invasive-glucose-monitor">non-invasive blood glucose</a> until it happens, no matter how many times companies say they <em>want</em> to do it. And I don't know what other non-gimmicky data points these companies have left to add; maybe <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-patent-shows-plans-to-monitor-mental-health">mental health</a> will be the next smartwatch focus.</p>
<h2 id="gemini-will-blow-up-on-smartwatches-2">Gemini will blow up on smartwatches</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="aK7fsfNsYnnbrmsSazYp2L" name="google-gemini-hero-banner-wide.jpg" alt="Google Gemini brings "custom Gems" to Gemini Advanced, Business, and Enterprise users." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aK7fsfNsYnnbrmsSazYp2L.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google spent 2024 cramming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> into every Google service and product that could support it, and ended the year promising that Gemini would be the baseline for its new smart glasses OS, Android XR. Even if I don't have any evidence, I'm fairly confident Google will make Gemini available with Wear OS 6 as a Pixel Watch 4 killer app — possibly a stripped-down version of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-live-is-available-for-free-on-android-phones">Gemini Live</a>.</p><p>This assumes Google can take Gemini Nano — the "smallest" version for smartphone on-device AI tools — and port it down to work on a smartwatch processor. It might depend on what kind of power the Snapdragon W5 Gen 2 can deliver, and could shut out current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android watches</a> with last-gen hardware not designed for Gemini.</p><p>"On the Gemini front, I think Google still needs to figure out a way to get Gemini to run smoothly on such performance-limited hardware," Sag told me. "That could come with RISC-V or some other more capable platform." But he agreed that "right now I don't think Google Assistant performance is where it should be," and said that he could see AI becoming "the connective fabric between all of our wearables."</p><p>If I'm wrong that Gemini can be scaled down to wearable form, I still expect Google to add more AI-powered tricks to Wear OS in some form. For example, it could add its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/fitbit-labs-insight-explorer-test-gemini-start">Fitbit Insight Explorer</a> to the Pixel Watch 4, so you could ask for context about your recent workouts — similar to Zepp Coach on Amazfit watches.</p><p>Samsung, which has always offered Bixby and Assistant, would also get access to Gemini. It recently unveiled <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-major-gen-ai-bixby-rework-arrives">Bixby AI</a> with LLM capabilities, but it's exclusive to Chinese phones for now; we don't know if it'd be ready by the Galaxy Watch 8. Still, One UI 6 Watch had plenty of AI tricks like Energy Score and auto-suggested replies, and Samsung will probably focus on other niche features, with a mix of cloud computing and on-device tricks.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-won-t-go-the-squircle-route-with-galaxy-watch-8-2">Samsung WON'T go the squircle route with Galaxy Watch 8</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yns83BF2vPg2t3YXGbLVPo" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-vs-apple-watch-ultra-2-2.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra vs. Apple Watch Ultra 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yns83BF2vPg2t3YXGbLVPo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In March 2024, SamMobile <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/future-galaxy-watches-may-adopt-apple-watch-squircle-design">reported inside knowledge</a> that Samsung was "looking to bring back the squarish design for its smartwatches," with "enthusiastic" internal support for the plan. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8</a> seemed the most likely candidate.</p><p>Samsung hasn't sold a squircle watch since the Gear S in 2014; although the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> <em>looks</em> more square-shaped due to its titanium bezel, the display is still circular. At the time, some Galaxy Watch fans <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-wants-square-galaxy-watch-again">resented the idea</a> of abandoning the traditional watch look for the squircle design so closely associated with Apple Watches.</p><p>I didn't mind the idea at the time and found the report plausible. But I recently remembered this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-management-furious-latest-product-design">August report</a> that Samsung chairman Lee Jae-yong allegedly lambasted the MX Division for "design plagiarism," with the Galaxy Watch Ultra and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">Galaxy Buds Pro 3</a> too similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> and AirPods Pro in features and looks.</p><p>Lee's "angry" response makes me doubt that Samsung's internal enthusiasm for squircles will make it onto a mainline Galaxy Watch. Even if Samsung designed a squircle watch before Samsung, most people would still see it as copying Apple, and that seems to be a sore spot for its chairman.</p><p>So don't be surprised if the Galaxy Watch 8 looks a lot like the last <em>four</em> Galaxy Watches: machine-cut, flat, and bezel-less. As for other models, we're due for our biannual Galaxy Watch 8 Classic, and Samsung might keep selling the Ultra as is for another year before progressing to the Ultra 2 (or abandoning it like it did the Watch 5 Pro).</p>
<h2 id="wear-os-will-bring-back-facer-2">Wear OS will bring back Facer</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="xpzJGSKNxSRtNCALZ9RDqF" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-6-Classic-facer-pokemon.jpeg" alt="A custom Facer watch face showing two Pokemon cheering for you on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xpzJGSKNxSRtNCALZ9RDqF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This may be nothing more than wishful thinking since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5-blocks-facer-and-makes-watch-faces-boring">Facer was one of my favorite Wear OS apps</a> before Google made the XML Watch Face Format the default on Wear OS 5 to extend battery life and left the decade-old app and its developers high and dry. But I want Facer back, and I think it'll happen in 2025.</p><p>Google won't go back on its restriction and let battery-guzzling faces back on Wear OS; they make the watches look short-lived for aesthetics. But its current solution — scrolling through a long list of watch faces in the Play Store without any organization — is terrible. Facer says it's "working hard with Google to solve this issue" and provide an alternative, and I believe them.</p><p>My guess is that Google will once again allow third-party apps to share watch faces to Wear OS as long as they're XML-coded, which would let Facer back onto new Wear OS watches — even if most of its 500,000 faces aren't compatible anymore. At the very least, fun XML watch faces would be much more findable on Facer, which would, in turn, incentivize developers to start <em>making</em> creative XML faces for us.</p>
<h2 id="my-less-reliable-2025-wear-os-predictions-2">My less reliable 2025 Wear OS predictions</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="nmdcQ593Sbg8a3GbAEY6hM" name="Wear-OS-watches-hero" alt="A pile of Wear OS watches: The Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra, 6, 6 Classic, and 5 Pro; the Google Pixel Watch 3 and 2; and the OnePlus Watch 2R." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nmdcQ593Sbg8a3GbAEY6hM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">I've reviewed a lot of Wear OS watches over the past few years, and I'm excited for what 2025 brings! </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>None of the above is certain, but I at least have evidence or solid reasons for speculating. Now I'll throw out my 2025 Wear OS predictions that aren't based on anything except vibes:</p><p>I won't be surprised if <strong>another Android OEM</strong> makes a Wear OS watch. Motorola, which once sold the Android Wear-based <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/moto-360-review-0">Moto 360</a> but now focuses on budget Moto OS trackers, seems like a possible candidate.</p><p>I'm also worried about <strong>slower Wear OS updates</strong> in 2025. Admittedly, this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/long-wear-os-5-update-delay-feels-like-bad-sign">has been a problem since Wear OS 3</a>, but I'm worried that brands like Mobvoi will really struggle with Wear OS 5 and keep selling Wear OS 4 watches in the interim. And with Wear OS 6, the gap between when new and last-gen watches get it could be even wider.</p><p>We could very well see the first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/googles-new-partnership-could-be-the-cure-for-wear-oss-health-data-headaches">Wear OS watch with <strong>Masimo health sensors</strong></a>, though it's possible that the hardware won't be ready to incorporate into watches until after 2025.</p><p>Lastly, I'll go out on a limb and guess that Google will <strong>make Fitbit available on all Wear OS watches in 2025</strong>. Even if it means losing that exclusivity for Pixel Watches, the data payoff would be worth it for them.</p>

Google and Samsung have their own methods of image AI image generation, so it's not surprising that Motorola also has a feature on select devices that lets you do just that.</p><p>Magic Canvas was initially just a way to generate images for wallpapers but has since evolved into something more capable. The feature, which is now part of Motorola's new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a> suite, is able to generate impressive images just by typing in a text prompt using various image styles. It works similarly to features like Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-pixel-studio">Pixel Studio app</a>, meaning owners of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones">Motorola phones</a> don't have to miss out on the ability to create fun images they can use as wallpapers or share with friends.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use-magic-canvas-2">How to use Magic Canvas</h2>
<p>1. <strong>Press and hold</strong> the home screen to bring up the customization menu.</p><p>2. Tap <strong>Wallpapers</strong>.</p><p>3. Tap <strong>Create with AI</strong>.</p><p>4. Tap <strong>Magic Canvas</strong>. If you're not already, you may be prompted to sign into your <strong>Moto account</strong>. Tap it and follow the prompts to sign in or create an account, otherwise continue on to the next steps.</p>

<p>5. <strong>Type a prompt</strong> into the Description box.</p><p>6. Select the desired <strong>aspect ratio</strong>. You can choose from 1:1 (square) or 9:16 (portrait orientation).</p><p>7. Select the desired <strong>Style</strong>. Options include Abstract, Cartoon, Fantasy, Futuristic, Impressionist, Minimalist, Pop Art, Realistic, Surreal, and Vintage.</p><p>8. Tap <strong>Generate Image</strong> and wait for the image to finish generating. This should take several seconds.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:79.65%;"><img id="RnN9PrbCBC9xZnyAeXkubX" name="Moto-AI-Magic-Canvas-2" alt="Generating an image with Magic Canvas" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RnN9PrbCBC9xZnyAeXkubX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3440" height="2740" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Once the image is generated, you can save it to your gallery, copy it to use later, share it, or set the image as a wallpaper. If you don't like the result, you can tap Redo, and Magic Canvas will generate another version of the image based on your prompt.</p>
<h2 id="get-creating-with-limits-2">Get creating, with limits</h2>
<p>Magic Canvas is a fun tool that lets you run wild with your imagination, allowing you to create fun and unique images on the fly. However, there are limits to the types of images you can create. Magic Canvas may not generate some images if it's perceived to be a sensitive topic, and you'll be met with a warning if you try to generate such images.</p><p>Furthermore, any image created with Magic Canvas will have a watermark in the bottom left corner that reads "AI Generated Image." It may not be as flashy as the watermark on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>-generated images, but it should get the job done to ensure the image is properly tagged.</p><p>Lastly, Magic Canvas is not available on every Motorola phone. The feature appears to be limited to higher-end devices, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">2024 Razr</a> series and Edge 50 series. To check if your phone has Magic Canvas, follow the first couple of steps in this guide to see if it appears in the "Create with AI" section of the Wallpaper settings menu.</p>
