                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/do-airpods-max-work-android-phones">AirPods Max</a> might be the most controversial pair of headphones on the planet. At $549, they are ridiculously expensive and feature controversial design decisions — like a heavy aluminum construction and no power button. On March 24, Apple <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/03/lossless-audio-and-ultra-low-latency-audio-come-to-airpods-max/" target="_blank">announced</a> that AirPods Max (USB-C) will gain support for lossless, wired audio and low-latency Bluetooth audio in an update next month.</p><p>But is that enough to move the needle for AirPods Max, an expensive and flawed pair of over-ear headphones?</p><p>Make no mistake: the AirPods Max should've supported wired audio from the very beginning. In fact, the older Lightning version of AirPods Max <em>did</em> support wired audio, albeit with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MXK22AM/A/lightning-to-35-mm-audio-cable-12m-white" target="_blank">$35 proprietary cable</a> that's no longer sold by Apple. However, when the company refreshed the headphones with a USB-C variant, that feature was seemingly dropped.</p><p>Now, Apple is bringing wired audio back to the AirPods Max, this time using the USB-C to USB-C cable that comes in the box. It's also selling a USB-C to 3.5mm cable for the new AirPods Max separately for other audio sources. At face value, this update — when it reaches AirPods Max (USB-C) owners in April — seems like a big upgrade. That is until you realize that almost all of Apple's competitors already supported wired audio on their over-ears.</p>

<p>Two of my favorite AirPods Max competitors for Android, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sonos-ace-review">Sonos Ace</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/dyson-ontrac-review">Dyson OnTrac</a>, shipped with wired audio capabilities from day one. Sonos includes a USB-C to USB-C and a USB-C to 3.5mm cable in the box, while Dyson sells a USB-C to 3.5mm cable separately for $20. The same goes for other excellent over-ear headphones, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/headphones/sony-wh-1000xm5-review">Sony WH-1000XM5</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bose-qc-ultra-headphones-review">Bose QuietComfort Ultra</a>.</p><p>Put simply, all the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">best wireless headphones</a> already support the feature Apple is just adding to the AirPods Max next month — it's not exactly groundbreaking.</p><p>Even Apple's own Beats headphones have worked with wired inputs for years. The current generation of Beats Studio Pro and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/beats-solo-4-review">Beats Solo 4</a> both support wired use, not only with a USB-C to USB-C cable but also with an inbuilt 3.5mm jack. That means the Studio Pro and Solo 4, both of which are Apple-made headphones costing a fraction of the price of AirPods Max, are actually more versatile.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2GVxL8kxeA2fWn5PHetDjK" name="beats-solo-4-usbc-aux-ports.jpg" alt="Beats Solo 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2GVxL8kxeA2fWn5PHetDjK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Beats Solo 4 cost under $200 and have two wired audio ports: USB-C and 3.5mm. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The update heading to AirPods Max (USB-C) units in April was long overdue. Despite the headphones costing a fortune, they weren't truly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/this-tiny-dongle-brings-aptx-lossless-to-any-phone-and-its-fantastic">"lossless" or "high-fidelity"</a> due to their reliance on wireless connection. When AirPods Max get the ability to use a cable, they'll finally unlock 24-bit, 48 kHz lossless audio.</p><p>Aside from the sound quality boost, there are a few practical benefits to using a cable. For instance, most airlines still rely on the 3.5mm jack for inflight entertainment. Unless you want to be using the cheap, tinny earbuds flight attendants pass around instead of your $549 headphones, you'll want them to support wired audio.</p><p>That's why I'm glad Apple finally got onboard — every pair of over-ear headphones should have a wired audio option.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1960px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="XgnvFNbWprf8irnWmbTi6j" name="Apple-AirPods-hero-240909_big.jpg.large_2x" alt="AirPods lineup, including the USB-C AirPods Max." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XgnvFNbWprf8irnWmbTi6j.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1960" height="1102" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Here's the thing: AirPods Max are still an incomplete product, even with the latest set of upgrades. When Apple upgraded the AirPods Max, it added USB-C and new colors and not much else. To that end, the $130 AirPods 4 are using newer chips and audio technology than the $549 AirPods Max. The same goes for the $249 AirPods Pro 2 and Powerbeats Pro 2.</p><p>With the incoming update, Apple is touting that AirPods Max (USB-C) will support ultra-low latency audio over a wireless connection with Apple devices. But as it turns out, AirPods Max won't support wireless lossless audio with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/apple-vision-pro-vs-meta-quest-3">Apple Vision Pro</a>. Of course, there aren't that many Vision Pro owners out there, but with that being said, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-pro-vs-airpods-pro-2">AirPods Pro 2</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/beats-powerbeats-pro-2-review">Powerbeats Pro 2</a> both support this feature thanks to their newer H2 chip.</p><p>It underscores that this feature drop for AirPods Max doesn't change the fact that they are lacking not only compared to competitors but also to Apple's own products. AirPods Max (USB-C) should've supported wired audio from the beginning. Even when it does, plenty of alternatives—like the QuietComfort Ultra, Sonos Ace, and Sony WH-1000XM5—will still be a better option at roughly half the price.</p>

<hr>
<p>A new rumor claims that Qualcomm might scrap the "Elite" branding for its next chipset and go with Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 instead.</p><p>According to leaker Digital Chat Station on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/Pk8WP9umB" target="_blank">Weibo</a>, Qualcomm is gearing up to introduce the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 next month (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Not-Elite-Snapdragon-8s-Gen-4-leak-outs-launch-info-and-key-details-of-the-Snapdragon-8s-Gen-3-successor.986339.0.html" target="_blank">Notebookcheck</a>). We’ve already got some early specs floating around thanks to recent leaks, giving us a sneak peek at what this chip is packing under the hood.</p><p>Keeping up with Qualcomm’s chip lineup isn’t easy, but the flagship series is a bit more straightforward. Qualcomm typically launches a top-tier SoC along with an “s” variant for budget-friendly flagships each year. With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> getting some pretty positive market feedback, all eyes are now on the upcoming sub-flagship chipset.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8s-elite-cores-power-leak">Contrary to earlier speculations</a>, DCS says Qualcomm is ditching the Snapdragon 8s Elite name in favor of Snapdragon 8s Gen 4.</p><p>The name change likely comes down to architecture. Unlike the Snapdragon 8 Elite with Qualcomm’s custom Oryon cores, the the 8s Gen 4 is sticking with off-the-shelf ARM designs.</p>
<h2 id="power-and-efficiency-mix-2">Power and efficiency mix</h2>
<p>According to DCS, the chip, designed as SN8735, will pack a 3.21GHz Cortex-X4 Prime Core, backed by three 3.01GHz Cortex-A720 cores and two 2.80GHz Cortex-A720 cores for heavy lifting. For better efficiency, it's expected to also include two 2.02GHz Cortex-A720 cores.</p><p>On the graphics front, the new chip is expected to rock an Adreno 825 GPU. They're from the same next-gen family, but leaks suggest Qualcomm might be trimming down the core size a bit. This means you'll still get great mobile gaming performance; just don't expect it to quite match the absolute top-tier 8 Elite's graphical muscle.</p><p>In a separate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/Pka9pm13K" target="_blank">Weibo post</a>, the leaker says the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 will use the same ISP as the Snapdragon 8 Elite. Plus, at least four <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> are already in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/qualcomm/the-first-snapdragon-8s-elite-phones-could-launch-next-month-leaker-claims">the works with this chip</a>, including the Redmi Turbo 4 Pro, iQOO Z10 Turbo Pro, Xiaomi Civi 5 Pro, and Oppo K13 Pro.</p><p>Reports suggest Qualcomm will launch the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 in April.</p>

<p>Samsung is reportedly working on another XR gear that will launch alongside its XR headset via Project Moohan. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.etnews.com/20250321000270">ETNews</a>, the Korean OEM is working on launching its first pair of XR smart glasses dubbed Project "HAEAN" which loosely translates to the sea coast or seashore according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-translate-could-soon-be-able-to-explain-its-translations-better">Google Translate</a>.</p><p>According to the publication, the company is working on finalizing what these glasses will set out to do. Much like the XR headset, it could be powered by Galaxy AI, and will be much smaller than the head-mounted XR gear.</p><p>"They display information or images on the glasses like the lenses of glasses and transmit sound from the frame," the publication added.</p><p>These glasses will likely be pitted against <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/metas-ray-ban-smart-glasses-are-a-hit-and-its-now-planning-a-massive-production-ramp-up">Meta's RayBan </a>smart glasses, which can be worn outdoors and interact with the surroundings, possibly with the help of AI. Previous<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-smart-glasses-unpacked-2025-glimpse-tipped"> leaks</a> indicated that they could weigh around 50 grams, have multiple cameras, and be coupled with the ability to make payments and respond to gestures and facial recognition.</p><p>It is also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-android-xr-smart-glasses-haean-3537694/?fbclid=IwY2xjawJO3yZleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHcTasEBO75KHlBx9GeyYRLuDyhb1cFulna83N_CnGHnirRlseB3swMJWKw_aem_lLsEiYPhvF8INj5anR-i8g">claimed</a> that these glasses could carry a Qualcomm chipset, and an NXP chip will be used as the auxiliary processing unit. The device could allegedly have a 12 MP camera with a Sony IMX681 CMOS image sensor. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-android-xr-smart-glasses-haean-3537694/?fbclid=IwY2xjawJO3yZleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHcTasEBO75KHlBx9GeyYRLuDyhb1cFulna83N_CnGHnirRlseB3swMJWKw_aem_lLsEiYPhvF8INj5anR-i8g">SamMobile</a> indicated that these mixed reality glasses will have a "155mAh battery Google's Gemini LLM will be installed on the device to provide AI features."</p>

<p>ETnews adds that Samsung is making sure that these glasses are comfortable to wear and is "putting a lot of effort into a design tailored to the human body."</p><p>Last year, Samsung even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses-trademark-approval-spotted">trademarked</a> its smart glasses at the Intellectual Property Office in the U.K. It was filed under the “Virtual reality headsets; Augmented reality headsets; Headphones; Smartphones; Smart glasses” categories.</p><p>An industry insider to ETnews, “With Apple’s Vision Pro already on the market, Samsung’s focus will be on providing a more advanced user experience.” While we don't know when these XR glasses could see the light of day, the publication very confidently says that it will be launched alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">XR headset </a>which is expected to launch later this year, after Samsung showed it off more vividly at the MWC 2025.</p>

<hr>
<p>OnePlus has a new accessory for its users to charge their phones effortlessly and that too in a smaller form factor.</p><p>Dubbed OnePlus Slim Magnetic Power Bank, it will be available for purchase through the OnePlus website for the U.S. market for $70. As the name suggests, the latest power bank is quite slimmer measuring 0.88cm in height at its thinnest. It further measures 9.6cm in length and 6.9cm in width.</p>

<p>On the whole, it will weigh around 120 grams. It is believed to be done by using high energy density battery cells, next to N52M magnets, and “a body composed of aluminum alloy to reduce overall thickness and weight,” OnePlus shares in an accompanying press release.</p><p>Additionally, the OnePlus Slim power bank packs in a decent 5000mAh battery capacity that provides USB Type-C charging next to supporting wireless charging, which claims to charge two iPhones at a time — since it is MagSafe compatible. There aren’t faster wireless charging speeds as they are limited to 7.5W for iPhones and 10W for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>. Even in the wired charging case, the power bank is limited to 10W wired charging.</p>

<p>Other perks of the power bank comprise NTC intelligent temperature control, which promises to ensure that the battery does not overheat when charging.

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Vivo stated at the end of last year that it would debut a mixed reality headset, and at the Boao Forum for Asia, the Chinese manufacturer showcased the design of the Vision. The design looks to be a sleeker version of the Apple Vision Pro, but at this point, there's no mention of what the headset weighs, and the materials used in its construction. <br><br>Vivo says it will debut the prototype in mid-2025, and other than that, it didn't divulge much in the way of information around the headset. The MR headset is a part of Vivo's strategy to "strengthen its real-time spatial computing capabilities for future applications in consumer robotics," and coinciding with the design showcase, Vivo is announcing the establishment of a new robotics laboratory in China.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2666px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:150.04%;"><img id="qEMDHu27ACujqUyCdvSM8n" name="Vivo Vision Discovery Edition" alt="Vivo Vision design reveal" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qEMDHu27ACujqUyCdvSM8n.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2666" height="4000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Vivo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Vivo will leverage the lab to build the "brain" and "eyes" of robots, utilizing its skillset when it comes to "AI large learning models and imaging." Vivo clearly is no stranger to doing a great job with imaging, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">X200 Pro</a> is currently the best camera phone to beat. So it will be interesting to see how the brand can translate these proficiencies to robotics. <br><br>Switching back to phones, Vivo has announced that it will unveil the X200 Ultra in the month of April. The manufacturer teased the camera modules last week, and earlier leaks gave us a better understanding of what the device will be able to deliver in this area, and having tested the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-ultra-review">Xiaomi 15 Ultra</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a> as well as the X200 Pro, I can't wait to get my hands on the X200 Ultra and see how Vivo manages to outshine the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-ultra-long-term-review">X100 Ultra</a> from last year. <br><br>However, it is likely the X200 Ultra may not debut outside China — much like its predecessor. We should know more about the device in the coming weeks, along with details on the Vivo Vision.</p>

<p>Motorola’s next-gen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable flagship</a> is already making moves, popping up in certification filings ahead of launch, and a new regulatory listing hints at some serious hardware upgrades inside.</p><p>A new listing on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://zd.taf.org.cn/#/equipmentDetail?code=34JfIVH%2BvTrlMf8jYpLKnS3dxml4OPYSqQZKXiv6M0hgV5NTK9C621FDd6Y0%2F9AtLR7k9WyZIlDX3aQ4d%2BWDSw%3D%3D" target="_blank">TENAA</a>, China's telecommunications certification authority, sheds light on a new device called the Moto Razr 60 Ultra, which is expected to be the global name for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025">Motorola Razr Plus 2025</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_razr_60_ultra_appears_on_tenaa_with_huge_battery_increase-news-67071.php" target="_blank">GSMArena</a>).</p><p>According to the listing shared by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/ZionsAnvin/status/1903651511759986956" target="_blank">Anvin on X</a>, the Razr Plus 2025 packs a dual-cell battery with rated capacities of 1,090mAh and 3,185mAh, totaling at least 4,275mAh.

<p>The next-gen Razr Plus may keep the 2024 model’s design, but Motorola is clearly making some big moves under the hood.</p>

<p>The new battery marks a big jump from the previous model’s 4,000mAh. Plus, Anvin reports 68W fast charging, a notable upgrade from the current 45W on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus 2024</a>.</p><p>Beyond the bigger battery, the Razr Plus 2025 is set to keep the same 6.9-inch inner foldable screen and 4-inch pOLED cover display. It’s also expected to pack dual 50MP rear cameras, a 50MP selfie snapper, and a Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, with up to 18GB of RAM and 2TB of storage.</p>
<h2 id="standard-razr-shrinks-and-switches-the-processor-2">Standard Razr shrinks and switches the processor</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, the regular Motorola Razr 2025 is rumored to pack the new MediaTek Dimensity 7400X chip and 12GB of RAM. In a surprising twist, a leak from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.xpertpick.com/mobile/motorola-razr-60-specifications-colour-options-design/" target="_blank">XpertPick </a>suggests it’ll shrink to a 6.7-inch display, down from the 6.9-inch screens used in previous models, including the 2024 Razr.</p><p>The regular model could also arrive in three colors: Pantone Gibraltar (blue), Pantone Lightest Sky (silver), and Spring Bud (green).</p><p>Motorola usually launches its Razr foldables in China first before going global, so chances are the company will stick to the same game plan this time.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-22">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>An OPPO-branded phone (PKX110) just cleared 3C certification, likely the OnePlus 13T or 13 Mini.</li><li>The listing reveals an 80W charging speed, but everything else is still a guessing game.</li><li>The phone is expected to rock the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip and a 6000mAh battery, just like the OnePlus 13.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A fresh leak has shed light on the key specs and features of OnePlus’ upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-small-android-phone">compact flagship</a>, the OnePlus 13T.</p><p>A mysterious OPPO-branded device, labeled PKX110, just passed 3C certification in China (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2025/03/23/oneplus-13t-3c-certified-snapdragon-8-elite-compact-phone-spotted-with-80w-charger/" target="_blank">Gizmochina</a>). While the certification doesn’t reveal its official name, reliable leaker Digital Chat Station speculates it could be the OnePlus 13T or possibly the OnePlus 13 Mini (as others like to call it), based on clues shared on Weibo.</p><p>The only thing the certification disclosed is the device’s 80W fast charging, while everything else is still under wraps.</p><p>Even though the listing doesn’t reveal much, earlier leaks and rumors suggest the device could sport a 6.3-inch 1.5K flat OLED display. Now, whether that counts as "compact" in 2025 remains debatable. Some may call it pocket-friendly; others may say it's just average-sized.</p><p>Previous leaks also suggest the OnePlus 13T will pack Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, along with a 6000mAh battery, matching the larger <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>.</p><p>The OnePlus 13T is rumored to feature a 50MP main sensor and a 50MP telephoto lens with 2x optical zoom. Details on the front camera are still under wraps. As for the rear camera setup, it’s not confirmed whether it’ll be vertical or horizontal, but leaks suggest a vertical layout.</p>
<h2 id="the-return-of-oneplus-t-series-2">The return of OnePlus' T-series</h2>
<p>The upcoming phone marks the revival of the brand's T-series, the first since the OnePlus 10T launched in 2022. Pricing is still a mystery, but with the OnePlus 13 starting at $899 and the 13R at $600, expect the 13T to land somewhere in that ballpark.</p><p>Leaks suggest the OnePlus 13T will stick with an optical fingerprint sensor, keeping in line with previous OnePlus flagships instead of switching to the ultrasonic tech used in the OnePlus 13.</p><p>The exact launch date is still up in the air, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-compact-flagship-phone-may-finally-have-a-launch-date">reports point to a China release in May</a> or late April.</p>

<ul><li>Google's Pixel Buds Pro 2 have rear mesh openings that, if blocked, can "greatly affect" sound quality.</li><li>You can clean the Pixel Buds Pro 2's rear mesh by using a few household items.</li><li>The company warns against using things like Q-tips or liquid chemicals, which can make matters worse.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Truly-wireless earbuds are notoriously difficult to clean, and Google's Pixel Buds Pro 2 are no exception. This month, Google published a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelbuds/thread/330665949/mesh-cleaning-tips-for-pixel-buds-pro-2" target="_blank">support document</a> detailing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-clean-your-headphones-earbuds">how to clean the Pixel Buds Pro 2 safely</a> to improve sound quality (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/24/pixel-buds-pro-2-clean-mesh/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). Specifically, the guide explains how to clean the rear vent mesh on the earbuds, which can help resolve "audio issues or unwanted noise."</p><p>When the earbuds are placed in your ear, the rear vent mesh is located at the top of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-review">Pixel Buds Pro 2</a>. The mesh can be blocked by things like earwax or dust over time, and so can the small opening on each earbud. Debris blocking Pixel Buds Pro 2 mesh or openings "can greatly affect the audio quality," per the company.</p>

<p>Luckily, it's easy to clean Pixel Buds Pro 2 with a few household items. You'll need an extra soft toothbrush, a paper towel, tap water, and Micellar water. The latter, Micellar water, is a type of water infused with small particles that can soak up debris like dust, dirt, or earwax. You can find it online or at grocery stores.</p><p>The following are Google's step-by-step instructions for cleaning Pixel Buds Pro 2 mesh:</p>
<ol start="1"><li>Pour regular water in a cup and micellar water into another.</li><li>Dip the toothbrush in micellar water and swish around so that the bristles are saturated. Hold your earbud in one hand and brush the mesh in deep circular motions for 15 seconds.</li><li>Blot the earbud on a paper towel to dry the earbud mesh. Repeat steps 2 and 3 twice.</li><li>Rinse your toothbrush by dipping it in micellar water and then dip it in regular water. Swirl your toothbrush in the water to make sure the bristles are clean from earwax.</li><li>Brush the mesh one last time with deep circular motions for 15 seconds.</li><li>Give your Pixel Buds Pro 2 at least  2 hours to air dry and make sure they’re completely dry before use. You can blot the earbud on a paper towel to gently, yet thoroughly, get rid of any residual water.</li></ol>
<hr>
<p>Additionally, Google notes some things you shouldn't do when trying to clean your Pixel Buds Pro 2. That includes using Q-tips, which the company says could push dust, dirt, or earwax deeper into the earbuds' mesh. Additionally, the support page warns against using detergents, sprays, and alcohol, since they can break Pixel Buds Pro 2 components. Finally, you shouldn't clean Pixel Buds Pro 2 while charging them.</p><p>While this new guide covers the rear mesh specifically, Google has a complete Pixel Buds cleaning guide available <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelbuds/answer/9112670" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<ul><li>Gemini Live's video and screen sharing support is beginning to roll out.</li><li>At least one user has gained access to the advanced features, which were showcased as part of Project Astra.</li><li>Google confirmed the live video and screen sharing features are rolling out for Gemini Advanced subscribers now.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Gemini Live's real-time video and screen sharing support is rolling out now for Gemini Advanced subscribers. The move is a long time coming for Google, which previewed this functionality as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-project-astra-ar-waitlist-opens-trusted-testers">Project Astra</a> as far back as Google I/O 2024. A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bard/comments/1jh42op/you_can_now_share_your_screen_mobile_to_gemini/" target="_blank">user on Reddit</a> first spotted the features' availability on a Xiaomi device, and Google later confirmed to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634480/google-gemini-live-video-screen-sharing-astra-features-rolling-out" target="_blank">The Verge</a> that they are beginning to roll out.</p><p>At <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-centrals-best-of-mwc-2025">MWC Barcelona 2025</a>, Google showcased the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini Live</a> features and revealed that they would <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/geminis-project-astra-could-land-on-your-phones-this-month">become available in late March</a>. Now, the ability to share live video and your phone screen in real-time is slowly rolling out, so the company is hitting its target. With this functionality, you can show Gemini Live what's around you — or what you're seeing on your phone — and ask questions about it with natural conversation.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bard/comments/1ji04ja/a_short_demo_of_project_astra_share_screen_with">A short demo of Project Astra (Share screen with Live)</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bard">r/Bard</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>Currently, if you activate Gemini, you may see an <strong>Ask about screen</strong> option. When the new Gemini Live capabilities fully roll out, you'll also see a <strong>Share screen with Live</strong> option if you're a Google One AI Premium subscriber. The former only takes a screenshot to share with Gemini, while the latter starts a real-time screen share that continues as your conversation with Gemini Live progresses.</p><p>Users will need to pay for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One AI Premium</a>, which costs $20 per month, for access to Gemini Live with video streaming capabilities. With that being said, new Pixel phone purchases come with free trials of varying lengths, so Pixel 9 series owners may get the Gemini Live's video and screen sharing support for free.</p><p>While the new Gemini Live functionality is expected to come to various Android devices, Google specifically noted that newer devices would gain access first (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/22/gemini-live-astra-rollout-start/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). Alongside the Samsung Galaxy S25 launch, Google said Pixel phones and the Galaxy S25 lineup would be “among the first to get Project Astra capabilities like screen sharing and live video streaming.”</p>

<hr>
<p>The new Motorola Razr 2025 series seems to be showing up on<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href=""> multiple leaks lately</a>, considering it could be released sometime in June this year, much like its predecessors. In the most recent leak, the alleged we get to see the first look of the alleged Motorola Razr 2025, also referred to as the "Motorola Razr 60" from all angles, a new colorway, with major specs also tipped off (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/24/motorola-razr-2025-display-battery-colors-leak/">via 9to5Google</a>).</p><p>The most recent leak comes from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.xpertpick.com/mobile/motorola-razr-60-specifications-colour-options-design/">Xpertpick</a>, which showed off renders of the alleged phone from all angles, including a new colorway that hasn't been a part of any recent leaks. The new color, dubbed "Spring Bug," showcases the device in a vibrant green hue, along with the other rumored colorways, such as dark blue and light grey colors dubbed “Gibraltar Sea" and  “Lightest Sky,” respectively.</p><p>Xpertpick further notes that their exclusive report is in collaboration with a "trusted source" that states that the Motorola Razr 2025 will see a smaller display of 6.7 inches when compared to 6.9 inches on the 2024 model. It will also support "wet touch functionality," enabling the user to use the screen even with wet hands.</p>

<p>At its core, the phone will reportedly be powered by a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-7400-7400x-ultra-efficient-gaming-ai-chips">MediaTek Dimensity 7400X</a> chipset and will arrive with 12GB RAM (up from 8GB in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2024-review">Razr 2024</a>) and internal storage of 512GB (up from 128GB). Other than that, the device is rumored to get a battery boost of 4,500mAh battery with support for 30W Turbocharging.</p><p>When it comes to cameras, the device is said to get a 50MP ultra-pixel primary sensor, an ultrawide+macro lens (unknown pixel count), and a 32 MP selfie camera.  The phone is rumored to keep its 3.6-inch cover display and run on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> out of the box with Hello UX on top and the company’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a> suite included.</p><p>In<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-plus-2025-wooden-finish-video-leaked"> other news,</a> the Motorola Razr Plus 2025 also showed up in a leak last week, showcasing a wooden finish. The device is said to stick to a 6.9-inch pOLED foldable display and a 4-inch cover screen. Other rumors claim the OEM will give the Razr Plus 2025 a 68W wired charging support.</p><p>That said, these are still leaks and should be taken with a grain of salt, while we wait to see what the actual device holds, here's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025#section-motorola-razr-plus-2025-price-availability">what we think will show up</a> on this year's Motorola Razr series.</p>

<p>The year 2025 is off to a fantastic start as far as budget and mid-range smartphones go. We've already got a pretty eclectic range of options to choose from, our current favorite being the Nothing Phone 3a. As a successor to the highly popular Phone 2a, the 3a offers a useful third telephoto camera, slightly quicker charging, and a brighter OLED display. It's not easily available everywhere, like in the U.S., which is where the Moto G Power 2025 comes in.</p><p>Motorola's offering is cheaper than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review">Phone 3a</a>, more readily available in the U.S., and has stronger waterproofing. It's also a solid and dependable phone with equally lean software, a decently long update commitment for its price, and you get wireless charging. Deciding between the Nothing Phone 3a vs. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-power-2025-review">Moto G Power 2025</a> can get tricky, but that's where we come in.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="HXRHuUBssdJd2SwshEXHr" name="nothing-phone-3a-back-01" alt="The transparent back of the white Nothing Phone (3a)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HXRHuUBssdJd2SwshEXHr.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Nothing Phone 3a follows the company's signature look of a transparent glass back panel with neatly laid out components. The side frame is plastic but it's matte so there's good enough grip when you hold it and it doesn't look cheap. We have the programmable Glyph lights too around the camera module which are a fun addition. The phone is slim but a bit weighty at 201 grams. Nothing has given it an IP64 rating for dust and splash resistance. While this is better than the 2a, it's not great for a mid-range phone in 2025. The 3a comes in white, black, and blue, but the latter is limited to select markets.</p><p>The Nothing Phone 3a's display is nicely specced with a large 6.77-inch AMOLED display and 120Hz refresh rate. It's a Full-HD resolution only but the pixel count is well above 300 ppi, so images and text look sharp. Nothing has chosen Panda Glass for scratch protection, which held up well when we tested it. Brightness levels are also pretty great with up to 1,300 nits when using it outdoors and up to 3,000 nits of peak brightness.</p>

<p>The Moto G Power 2025 has slightly taller dimensions but similar thickness and weight as the Phone 3a. The design is now similar to Motorola's more premium phones, which gives the G Power better street cred. We also liked the tough build quality of the phone which earns it a MIL-STD-810H rating. The back panel is made of faux-leather instead of glass but it still looks and feels quite premium. The lack of glass also means there's no worry of any shattering if you drop it. The G Power 2025 comes in a striking Leaf Green colorway and also Slate Gray.</p><p>The Moto G Power 2025 doesn't have a very captivating display as the Nothing Phone 3a, but it gets the job done. It's a 6.8-inch IPS panel with a similar resolution, 120Hz refresh rate, and Gorilla Glass 5 scratch protection. The display worked fine in all lighting conditions during our review period, and we didn't face any issues.</p><p>The one design feature that really makes this phone stand out if the IP68/ IP69 rating. IP69 is something that's not available even on most flagship phones, so to see this on a $300 phone is pretty cool.</p>

<p>The Nothing Phone 3a is only available in the U.S. via the beta program, which means you need to jump through a few hoops in order to get it. As of writing this, Nothing's website says the 3a is sold out and new stocks are only expected in two months. Only the top-end variant with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage is listed for $379. Nothing does sell a base variant too with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage in other markets for less. Apart from availability, there are compatibility issues right now with AT&T and Verizon's networks, but T-Mobile works just fine.</p><p>The Nothing Phone 3a uses the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ai-is-coming-to-more-budget-phones-thanks-to-qualcomms-new-snapdragon-7s-gen-3">Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 3</a> processor, which is a budget SoC optimized to improve AI performance. Sadly, gaming performance is actually worse than its predecessor, which is a step down. We noticed lower FPS in games like Minecraft on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-vs-phone-2a">Phone 3a vs. the 2a</a>.</p><p>Thankfully, battery life is very good for a phone of its class. The 5,000mAh capacity will easily carry you through more than a day before you'll need to charge it. The 50W wired charging also ensures the battery is charged quickly, although you'll need to buy the charger separately. Wireless charging is a bit of a miss, something that the Moto offers.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4027px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jQHoQi76jvswKMGjfKBzpD" name="Moto-G-Power-2025-review-11" alt="Honkai Star Rail on the Moto G Power 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jQHoQi76jvswKMGjfKBzpD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4027" height="2265" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Moto G Power 2025 delivers equally good battery life with the same capacity as the 3a. Charging speed is slower at 30W and you'll need to buy the adapter separately. There is 15W wireless charging, which is pretty good for a phone of its class.</p><p>The G Power 2025 only comes in a single variant with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage for $299. This makes it more affordable than the Phone 3a. Being a Motorola, you'll also easily find it online or at offline stores in the U.S. and it's compatible with all the major carriers. What's not so great though is the performance. Somehow, Motorola picked a worse SoC than the 2024 model for the new G Power and that shows even in everyday use. Even with 8GB of RAM and a clean UI, we noticed intermittent lag and sluggishness when using it. It's certainly not the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-phone-gamers">best phone gaming</a> and performs worse than the Phone 3a.</p>

<p>With the Nothing Phone 3a, you get three OS upgrades and six years of security patches. The phone ships with Nothing OS 3.1, which is based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> and includes all the latest AI features like<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/nothing-essential-space-ai-hub-what-pixel-screenshots-should-have-been"> Essential Space</a>. This feature is still in beta but the dedicated button makes it very easy to fire up some of the apps like voice memo or note-taking, when needed. More smart features like Smart Search, Smart Collections, and Focus Search are expected to come in a future update. The interface is clean and bloat-free, which is something we really like about Nothing's software approach.</p><p>The Moto G Power 2025 has a similar near-stock Android-like experience. You get Android 15 out of the box but only two major OS upgrades after that. Motorola hasn't had the best track record of issuing timely updates either so we'll take this promise with a bit of salt for now. As we mentioned above, the interface does get sluggish at times even if you're not doing anything taxing. There aren't many AI features either as that isn't really the focus of this phone.</p>

<p>Nothing debuts a telephoto camera on its phones for the first time in the Phone 3a (and 3a Pro). The 3a boasts an impressive 50MP telephoto with 2x optical zoom and 30x digital zoom. There's also a 50MP main camera and an 8MP ultrawide. In our testing, we came away impressed with the image quality from all the cameras, which is a big improvement over the Phone 2a. The phone can also do 4K 30fps videos, which is pretty respectable.</p><p>The cameras on the Moto G Power 2025 are serviceable under good lighting, but that's about it. You only get a 50MP wide and an 8MP ultra-wide sensor on the back, both of which deliver okay image quality. The same goes for the 16MP selfie camera, which is no match for the 32MP sensor in the Phone 3a.</p>

<p>If you live in a region outside the U.S. where the Nothing Phone 3a is easily available, you should 100% buy it over the Moto G Power 2025. It might cost a bit more, but you'll be getting a vastly better-looking phone as well as excellent cameras, good performance, slick software with a longer update cycle, and quicker charging. Apart from the weaker waterproofing and no wireless charging, there's no major con going against it. The Nothing Phone 3a Pro is also worth considering if you need better telephoto and selfie cameras.</p><p>For those living in the U.S., the Moto G Power 2025 is still a good buy at $300. If your priority is battery life and a phone that can survive a dishwasher, there's nothing better in this segment. You should be able to find the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7a-review">Pixel 7a</a> for around $329 online as an alternative to the Moto. The Pixel gets you much better cameras, an OLED screen, an IP67 rating, and software updates till early 2028.</p>

<p>The iPhone vs. Android debate is as old as time but sometimes, the decision is not that simple. In the case of the iPhone 16e vs. OnePlus 13R, those coming from an older number series iPhone might hesitate to get a new iPhone with just one camera and an older design. That's where the OnePlus 13R poses a real threat as it's a pretty compelling alternative to the 16e at the same price.</p><p>The biggest strength of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16e-review">iPhone 16e</a> is that it uses (nearly) the same chipset as the latest 16 series and it supports Apple Intelligence. It's compact, has great battery life, and supports wireless charging (although, no MagSafe). The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a> is one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best cheap phones</a> to buy. It has proper flagship specs that give the 16e a run for its money, on paper. But it's not the easiest to get a hold of in all countries and not everyone wants to carry around a massive slab of metal and glass in their pockets.</p><p>Putting aside the whole iOS vs. Android preference for a second, let's see if the 16e makes a strong enough case against the 13R.</p>
<h2 id="iphone-16e-vs-oneplus-13r-design-2">iPhone 16e vs. OnePlus 13R: Design</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="WEYLGyVXsFFWuYqNHJx5Vo" name="OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13R review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WEYLGyVXsFFWuYqNHJx5Vo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The iPhone 16e is the spiritual successor of the iPhone SE but thankfully, Apple has finally done away with Touch ID and the thick bezels of that series. Instead, the 16e looks very much like the iPhone 14 with flat sides, front, and back. The bezels around the display are thicker than the iPhone 16 but that was to be expected. The phone sports Face ID in the old-style Apple notch and the mute switch has been replaced by the Action Button. You don't get the Camera Control button from the 16, which is fine.</p><p>The 16e gets a glass back, a USB-C port, and only eSIM support in U.S. models. Sadly, there are only two colors to choose from, white or black. My guess is Apple sort of knew that the 16e would not be that popular at launch, given the reduction in features and higher price than the SE, but we could see more colors added later in the year or with next year's revision based on how well it sells.</p><p>What you'll love with the iPhone 16e is the amazingly compact size and low weight. Compared to the 13R, the 16e is just 167 grams and measures only 7.8mm in thickness. That's a pretty slim and light phone, something that we don't see too many of in the Android world. The 16e is also IP68 rated which again trumps the IP65 rating of the 13R.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ScxcJvU3f2NQKUqcMUSY3e" name="Apple iPhone 16e" alt="Apple iPhone 16e review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ScxcJvU3f2NQKUqcMUSY3e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The OnePlus 13R is a massive phone compared to the 16e in dimensions and weight, but manages to be nearly as slim. It is built well with aluminum and glass all around and it looks like a typical Android flagship. You only get two colors here, Nebula Noir and Astral Trail, similar to the 16e. The 13R bears a lot of resemblance to the flagship OnePlus 13, just without the Hasselblad branding.</p><p>The 13R features the signature OnePlus slider for quickly changing alert modes, which is something the 16e's Action button can also be configured to do. There's USB-C with 80W fast charging, an IP65 rating, but no wireless charging.</p>
<h2 id="iphone-16e-vs-oneplus-13r-display-2">iPhone 16e vs. OnePlus 13R: Display</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="jGr6Vb26huSnTYSorwu9Zo" name="OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13R review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jGr6Vb26huSnTYSorwu9Zo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The iPhone 16e has a pretty good display for a budget iPhone. It's a 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR OLED panel with a greater than Full-HD resolution, P3-color gamut support, and 1,200 nits of peak brightness for HDR content. Sadly, all non-Pro iPhones are still stuck with a 60Hz refresh rate and no always-on mode despite being an OLED screen. I guess it's going to take a lot more courage to add this than it did to remove the headphone jack. Thankfully, the display works just as well indoors as it does under direct sunlight, and we were quite happy with its performance when we tested it.</p><p>The OnePlus 13R absolutely decimates the 16e's display with top-notch specs. It's a 6.78-inch LTPO AMOLED panel with a higher 2,780 x 1,264 resolution, and a refresh rate that can vary from 1Hz to 120Hz. For scratch protection, there's Gorilla Glass 7i, and it has a rated peak brightness of 4,500 nits. The sheer size of the display makes viewing any sort of content infinitely better. The cutout for the selfie camera is also unobtrusive, unlike the 16e's notch.</p>
<h2 id="iphone-16e-vs-oneplus-13r-hardware-and-battery-2">iPhone 16e vs. OnePlus 13R: Hardware and battery</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="sg365XFeSSLidRTc9qft9e" name="Apple iPhone 16e" alt="Apple iPhone 16e review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sg365XFeSSLidRTc9qft9e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The iPhone 16e starts at $599 for 128GB of storage, $699 for 256GB, and $899 for 512GB. All variants feature 8GB of RAM since that's the minimum needed for Apple Intelligence. The base model is probably something most buyers would consider as paying anything more doesn't make sense for such compromised specs. The good thing is that you can easily get this via your carrier in the U.S. for a small monthly fee.</p><p>The iPhone 16e has the same A18 SoC found in the iPhone 16, but with one GPU core disabled. As a result, benchmark numbers are a bit lower but you'll barely notice any performance hit in real-world usage. All games run well and multitasking is a cakewalk for the 16e.</p><p>Battery life is also one of the big highlights here as the new in-house Apple C1 5G modem proves to be more power-efficient than any of the Qualcomm ones in other iPhone models. Coupled with a fairly large 3,961mAh capacity, you should easily get a full day's worth of usage out of it, or even more. There's fast charging but it's only 20W, which isn't really considered fast in 2025. The 16e does support wireless charging at 7.5W but nothing higher like you get with other iPhones with MagSafe charging.</p>

<p>The OnePlus 13R is available as a single variant with 12GB of RAM and 256GB storage for $599.99, in the U.S.. It's not widely available from online retailers as of this writing, so your only option may be OnePlus.com. You'll also have to buy this unlocked only in the U.S., as none of the carriers offer any subsidies on it.</p><p>The OnePlus 13R uses the powerful Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 from Qualcomm, which can easily handle the most stressful apps and games without breaking a sweat. Unfortunately, eSIM is one feature we found missing from the 13R, but the SIM slot can accept two SIM cards.</p><p>Battery life is on another level thanks to the beastly 6,000mAh capacity. In our testing, the OnePlus 13R easily lasted two full days on one charge, which is pretty insane. That's almost twice as long as the 16e lasted. It misses out on wireless charging, but I don't think anyone will miss it since there's support for 80W charging. Plus, you get the compatible charger in the box, which is not the case with the 16e.</p>
<h2 id="iphone-16e-vs-oneplus-13r-cameras-2">iPhone 16e vs. OnePlus 13R: Cameras</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="SyXHkHQrvwWPstiejLpNVo" name="OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13R review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SyXHkHQrvwWPstiejLpNVo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's hard to believe it but the iPhone 16e has just a single camera on the back. Apple calls it a "2-in-1" camera system where the 2x zoom mode crops in on the sensor for a zoomed-in view, without having to use digital zoom. It's a trick Apple has been using on its iPhones for a while. Zooming in any further though reveals visible noise in photos, as we found out in our review. Despite its budget stature, the 16e can still record Dolby Vision videos at 4K 60fps. The front 12MP camera is similar to the iPhone 16. The 16e misses out on some camera features like Action mode and Cinematic mode, which are present on the 16.</p><p>The OnePlus 13R has an upgraded 50MP main sensor, which does a superb job of capturing fine details in still photos. Unlike the 16e, you get an ultrawide and telephoto camera on the back. We didn't find the secondary cameras to be too impressive, though. The telephoto, while nice to have, can only do 2x optical zoom, so anything beyond that is still digital. The 16MP selfie camera is also strictly okay.</p>
<h2 id="iphone-16e-vs-oneplus-13r-software-2">iPhone 16e vs. OnePlus 13R: Software</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="u4vj4uieypnqPF7tvBLr6e" name="Apple iPhone 16e" alt="Apple iPhone 16e review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/u4vj4uieypnqPF7tvBLr6e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The iPhone 16e is primed to get several major iOS versions for at least the next four years. Not to mention, you'll always get a new update along with every other iPhone on day one. The 16e is majorly about getting Apple Intelligence into the hands of more users and while many of the AI features are still in beta, we found some useful ones when we tested it. Visual Intelligence for instance works similar to Google Lens, and is able to look up locations and objects easily by simply pointing the camera at it.</p><p>The OnePlus 13R ships with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/i-used-oxygenos-15-for-a-week-these-are-my-favorite-features" target="_blank">OxygenOS 15</a>, which is based on Android 15. OnePlus has pledged four years of OS upgrades which is decently long, but not great. The redesigned interface is slick and there are plenty of options to customize the look and feel to your liking. OnePlus isn't selling its AI features as aggressively as others, but there are a few useful ones baked in like AI Unblur and Reflection Eraser.</p>
<h2 id="iphone-16e-vs-oneplus-13r-which-should-you-pick-2">iPhone 16e vs. OnePlus 13R: Which should you pick?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="SyXHkHQrvwWPstiejLpNVo" name="OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13R review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SyXHkHQrvwWPstiejLpNVo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The OnePlus 13R is the more powerful and feature-rich phone of the two, and is the one I'd recommend to most buyers. Even in the U.S., if you don't mind putting down $600 in one go, you should get the 13R over the iPhone 16e. It has a vastly better and bigger display, a great set of cameras, excellent performance, superb battery life, and slick software. The lack of wireless charging and the lower IP rating is not that big of a blow if you ask me.</p><p>The iPhone 16e is a great starter iPhone for Apple Intelligence once the price drops closer to $500. At full price, you might as well look for a good deal on the iPhone 15 instead which has an ultrawide camera and MagSafe charging. The Pixel 9a also makes for a good alternative and is worth checking out. If you're coming from a really old iPhone like the last SE or the Xr, then the 16e is a good upgrade, but only during sales.</p>

<p>The feature may require a bit more setup to get going. If you don't have cross-device services setup, then you will be prompted to set this up to allow other devices to connect to your Pixel. This will take you through each Google email associated with your phone, and you can choose which devices to allow in a device group.</p><p>Make sure you have the other Pixel phone you want to use added to your device group. Once the group is set up, make sure to <strong>tap</strong> <strong>Add</strong> on the other Pixel when you receive the notification to join the device group.</p>

<p>Once it's all set up, it's time to try out Connected Cameras and see all the cool things it can do.</p>
<p>1. Once on and in a compatible app, you will find the floating <strong>Camera Picker</strong> option. If you leave this feature on all the time, simply touch and hold the Camera Picker in the app and drag it to the “X” at the bottom of the screen if you choose not to use it.</p><p>2. <strong>Tap the floating Camera Picker</strong> to view connected devices.</p><p>3. If you want to use a Pixel device, select <strong>Add Pixel</strong> as your remote camera. You will need to allow permissions on the secondary device to get started. (If you want to use a GoPro, go to <strong>Bluetooth, Connected Devices</strong>, and <strong>Pair new device</strong>, then put the camera in pairing mode and connect.)</p>

<h2 id="other-details-to-note-about-connected-cameras-2">Other details to note about Connected Cameras</h2>
<p>You can connect any of the supported devices to function as your remote camera with the Connected Cameras feature. However, the devices need to be signed into the same Google account. Only one remote camera can be connected at a time. If you want to use a different device, disconnect the first camera and connect the other.</p><p>When recording, audio comes from the camera that is currently in use, so keep this in mind to ensure you get favorable sound to complement your video. Also, note that if you use a Bluetooth audio source, it can degrade the streaming quality of your video.</p><p>Connected Cameras is a useful new feature with the Google Pixel 9 series devices, which count among <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">the best Android phones</a>. It’s both convenient and fun for content creators looking to up their game or just experiment with recording and capturing moments in unique ways without having to own a complicated camera rig.</p>

<p><em><strong>Alex asks:</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>I saw the news about Google not complying with the EU regulations and I was wondering what would happen if Google just ignored it?</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Can Google be banned in Europe? </strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Thanks </strong></em></p>
<p>Howdy Alex and thanks for such a great question!</p><p>Usually, I spend my thinking time wondering how Google will find ways to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/eu-commission-finds-that-google-search-and-play-store-fail-to-comply-with-dma">comply with laws and regulations</a> and still keep an advantage, and never thought about Google just saying no.</p><p>I've no doubt that's what it <em>really </em>wants to do: just laugh and keep on truckin' without a care. That's a way to make lots and lots of money, after all. But I don't think Google will. I also think the EU wouldn't go as far as kicking Google out of the continent (so to speak).</p>
<p>Normally, laws and regulations are set up as a compromise. A good example is how countries want factories to make goods but don't want them to just churn out pollution. A common ground must be found that benefits both sides and, in a best-case scenario, also benefits the citizenship. What we are seeing right now in the U.S. and elsewhere isn't quite normal, so it's easy to forget how it's <em>supposed</em> to work.</p><p>I think the EU's DMA (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-is-digital-markets-act">Digital Markets Act</a>) is a really good idea. It's not perfect, but no set of regulations will ever be perfect. I also agree with the rulings that Google is violating and want to see the company forced to do the right thing, even if it costs them a little bit of money in the end.</p><p>I say I think they will find a solution, but let's explore what happens if they don't.</p>
<h2 id="two-worst-case-scenarios-2">Two worst-case scenarios</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1389px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="uCyqjgRgv6aNdMgFBZcHE3" name="google-my-ads-center-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Google My Ad Center on a Chromebook" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uCyqjgRgv6aNdMgFBZcHE3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1389" height="781" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If Google were to just ignore the DMA rulings two very bad things could happen.</p><p>The first is that the company is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-canada-trade-ban">banned from doing business</a> in the EU. While Google may be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-its-good-that-companies-like-google-face-antitrust-cases">unfairly using its status</a> to exert more control over things like payments and ads, a lot of people and companies are making money through the company. If Google were to be "banned," that means more than not being able to sell <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/the-google-tv-streamers-best-feature-comes-to-more-streaming-devices">TV Streamers</a>; it means not being able to sell ad space or services like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-workspace-feature-drop-rolled-out-with-gemini-inclusion">Google Workspace,</a> and plenty of companies depend on those services.</p><p>Taking Google out of the picture would mean a mad scramble for companies to find replacements that might cost a lot more and could drive many of them out of business. EU regulators and Google both know this, and that's why I don't think this would ever happen — it would have a terrible effect on the very people the EU is claiming to protect and Google claims to want to serve.</p>
<p>Another possibility is even worse: Google says no, and the EU does nothing about it.</p><p>If Google were to just keep on doing business the way it always has, even though the DMA has ruled it can't, and <strong>nothing</strong> happens, it would open a floodgate. Other companies would see this and know that they might be able to ignore the law, and Google would 100% go further.</p><p>Imagine a trifecta of corporate greed consisting of Google, Meta, and Amazon, knowing they can do whatever they like without any repercussions. Executives would have visions of swimming in a pool filled with gold like Scrooge McDuck.</p><p>The reasons the DMA was enacted would then mean nothing, and companies would try to use any practices, fair or otherwise, to gain an advantage. Then they would use it.</p>
<h2 id="what-will-probably-happen-2">What will probably happen</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="mdoWdTq5cdpF4iXSF89pmQ" name="Verizon-att-t-mobile-bribe.jpg" alt="Illustration of carriers taking money from someone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mdoWdTq5cdpF4iXSF89pmQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The EU is going to continue to make demands, and Google is going to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-beats-eu-antitrust-case-avoids-dollar17b-fine-for-ad-monopoly">continue to fight them</a>. This is normal behavior between two sides with different goals. It's a shame so much money will be spent to try to find common ground, but it is what it is.</p><p>Fines will be levied, which Google will appeal and protest. In the end, the rulings will be "bent" slightly, so Google wins a little bit, and the company will pay some money for being so stubborn about it. We're talking traffic ticket level of justice here, not something like execs facing jail time or anything. There will be no re-enactment of Bastille Day or guillotines involved.</p><p>This will also send the right message to others: we (the EU) will find a way to enforce our laws and reign you in; we're not afraid to fight it out. Then Google will find another way to skirt the rules until it gets caught. There is too much money to be made for it to go any other way.</p>

This is definitely a good thing, considering that it's really the only alternative to Google and Samsung.</p><p>Earlier in 2024, we saw the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/mobvoi-ticwatch-pro-5-enduro-review">TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro</a> released, and now, the TicWatch Atlas is here. Mobvoi must feel like it struck gold with the design of the TicWatch Pro 5, as the company has basically released three smartwatches that are almost identical, including the TicWatch Atlas.</p><p>Despite the name change, is the Atlas really all that different from the Enduro? Or is Mobvoi just trying to release something new for the sake of it?</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-mobvoi-ticwatch-atlas-price-and-availability"><span>Mobvoi TicWatch Atlas: Price and availability</span></h2>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="9poxd2GLo8jT45v2U8bo7T" name="ticwatch-atlas-review-1" alt="TicWatch Atlas sitting in dirt and rocks" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9poxd2GLo8jT45v2U8bo7T.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Mobvoi announced the TicWatch Atlas in October 2024, arriving almost six months after the Pro 5 Enduro. It's still only available in one size, but there you can choose either the Black or Silver color way. The Atlas is priced at $349. It's currently available from Mobvoi directly, Amazon, and a few other online retailers.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-mobvoi-ticwatch-atlas-what-i-like"><span>Mobvoi TicWatch Atlas: What I like</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="M7xMiGGr8kB9uvj9qaT42T" name="ticwatch-atlas-review-3" alt="TicWatch Atlas on wrist showing secondary screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/M7xMiGGr8kB9uvj9qaT42T.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On paper, there's really not much to write home about when it comes to what the TicWatch Atlas has to offer compared to the Enduro. In fact, the specs are identical, with the only difference being in the markings on the bezel surrounding the screen.</p><p>You might be wondering why I would include this in this section, and it's simply because Mobvoi's taken a "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" approach. Currently, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/qualcomm-snapdragon-w5-platform-announcement">Snapdragon W5 Plus Gen 1</a> is still the "newest" wearable SoC from Qualcomm. So I can't really give Mobvoi grief here, as it's not like the company has the capital and infrastructure to develop its own chip.</p><p>Plus, I have yet to deal with anything like stutters or slowdowns whenever I interact with the watch itself. Everything that the Atlas offers, just works, so I just really haven't found much to complain about.</p>

<p>It also helps that the Atlas continues Mobvoi's reign as the "battery champ" for wearables. Well, at least those that don't cost more than $500. I love being able to have a smartwatch that lasts for two to three days at a minimum but usually lasts even longer.</p><p>As I've said in my previous TicWatch reviews, I'm a big fan of the size, even if it isn't for everyone. Thankfully, for me, at least, that trend continues with the Atlas, as the watch just rests nicely on my wrist. Although I do have to point out that I wish there were more 24mm bands to choose from, that's not Mobvoi's fault.</p>

<p>This is all made possible by Mobvoi's dual-screen display, combining a 1.43-inch OLED screen with an Ultra low-power display. Just like previous iterations, this secondary screen basically operates as the "always-on display" but shows more information than just the time, date, and battery life.</p><p>You'll also find all of the "normal" stuff at your disposal, such as sleep tracking, a variety of workouts, blood oxygen monitoring, and more. There's even a new "Heat Map" feature, which Mobvoi says will keep track of "where you're most active" during a game. It's an interesting addition, but it isn't something that I actually tried because I don't play sports anymore unless you count the "run to keep my son from falling and bumping his head" game.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-mobvoi-ticwatch-atlas-what-i-don-t-like"><span>Mobvoi TicWatch Atlas: What I don't like</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="tegawp8PXfrN5a8dhZNQuS" name="ticwatch-atlas-review-7" alt="Side profile view of TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro and TicWatch Atlas" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tegawp8PXfrN5a8dhZNQuS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On the one hand, I want to give Mobvoi some kudos for releasing the TicWatch Atlas with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-4">Wear OS 4</a>. And while I want to give the company grief about the lack of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a>, it's tough to do so when Google itself is dealing with rollout struggles for older hardware.</p><p>But there's one thing missing, literally one thing, that's making me go right back to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> as soon as I'm done with this review — Google Assistant/Gemini. I don't care (all that much) that Wear OS 5 isn't available yet, partially because I've just accepted the fact that it'll probably be another year before it comes to the Pro 5, Enduro, or Atlas.</p><p>It's great being able to download and install apps from the Play Store while enjoying them on the Atlas's big OLED screen. But that fun starts to fade away when you expect (or at least hope) that the basic functions of similar smartwatches are just not there.</p><p>Searching for Assistant in the Play Store on the Atlas pulls up a bunch of results that don't matter. And while I've read about a few workarounds, I haven't tried them simply because I shouldn't have to. So, as much as I have truly enjoyed what Mobvoi has done over the past couple of years, I just can't get over this hurdle.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="6zqBc6gYeCRLLeQBPwmg3T" name="ticwatch-atlas-review-4" alt="TicWatch Atlas next to Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra and Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6zqBc6gYeCRLLeQBPwmg3T.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Something else that I've started to notice is that my wrist will vibrate. I'll look at the watch, and there's nothing. Nothing on my phone, nothing hidden in the notification tray, just nothing.</p><p>It seems that this might not actually be a problem with the Atlas specifically, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-ghost-vibrations-user-reports">Galaxy Watch 7 owners</a> have reported similar issues. Since Samsung's latest wearable uses Wear OS 5, it's not like we can point to Wear OS 4 as the source of the problems.</p><p>Another gripe that I have is that I don't fully understand Mobvoi's wearable strategy. Going from the Pro 5 to the Pro 5 Enduro made sense, as the latter was just an iteration of the original. But here's the thing: the Atlas is just an iteration of the Enduro.</p><p>For some reason, Mobvoi opted to start an entirely "new" lineup of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">smartwatches</a> with the Atlas despite only including very minor and subtle changes. While I'm not advocating for some type of drastic redesign, I think Mobvoi might have been better suited to go with the "TicWatch Pro 5 Atlas" instead. Or even use a different word, reserving "Atlas" for a different lineup.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-mobvoi-ticwatch-atlas-competition"><span>Mobvoi TicWatch Atlas: Competition</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="9Tpd5FVeGcDAeu3mAesDZd" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-run-activity.jpeg" alt="The main run activity data screen on the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9Tpd5FVeGcDAeu3mAesDZd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This would have been the year for the Atlas to really compete with the Galaxy Watch Classic. However, Samsung opted to ditch that version entirely this year, opting instead to go with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Watch Ultra</a>. So when it comes to price, the Atlas is more of a competitor to the Watch 7, seeing as it's just $50 more.</p><p>That being said, Samsung's latest wearable wins out thanks to having <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> out of the box, along with the ability to actually use Google Assistant. Plus, since Samsung uses smaller band sizes, you have many more options to choose from if you want to swap out the included band for something else.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> is another viable competitor, although neither of Samsung's or Google's offers are going to be quite as durable as the Atlas. For the first time, Google offers two different sizes with the Watch 3, solving one of my big annoyances with the Pixel Watch and Watch 2.</p><p>Although Google is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-watch-1-and-2-users-will-have-to-wait-for-wear-os-5">dealing with issues</a> surrounding the Wear OS 5 update for its first two smartwatches, that's not the case with the Watch 3. Even still, you get to enjoy <em>all</em> of the luxuries that Wear OS has to offer, without worrying about making any sacrifices.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="c4Z2Qxc2HNYK7fALtXxBQC" name="oneplus-watch-3-battery-modes" alt="The two battery modes of the OnePlus Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/c4Z2Qxc2HNYK7fALtXxBQC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Lastly, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-review">OnePlus Watch 3</a> seemingly came out of nowhere to challenge the Atlas for the title of "Battery King." The Watch 3 is rated for up to six days on a single charge, which can be stretched to seven if you turn off AOD and sleep tracking. But it also has the added benefit of super-fast charging, with a 20-minute charge adding "about 75% to the battery, and another 20 minutes will bring it to a full charge."</p><p>That's not to say the Watch 3 is perfect. Those in North America can't use the built-in ECG, and like the Atlas, it lacks LTE connectivity and is only available in one size. But along with being less expensive, OnePlus has already committed to two software updates and quarterly security patches.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="edzrvhsrH8iSWMx945KmuS" name="ticwatch-atlas-review-2" alt="TicWatch Atlas on wrist showing primary display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/edzrvhsrH8iSWMx945KmuS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want the best battery life in a Wear OS smartwatch.</li><li>You want a rugged smartwatch for under $400.</li><li>You don't care about having the latest version of Wear OS.</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want to be able to use Google Assistant.</li><li>You already own the TicWatch Pro 5 or Pro 5 Enduro.</li><li>You're on a budget.</li></ul>
<p>Maybe it's because I've already used and reviewed both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ticwatch-pro-5-review">TicWatch Pro 5</a> and Pro 5 Enduro, but I just haven't found a reason to be super excited about the Atlas. There are very few differences between the Atlas and the Enduro, with the exception of the slight design changes to the case. With that in mind, if you already have the Enduro or even the Pro 5, you're probably better off just waiting to see what the next Mobvoi release brings.</p><p>I'm even having a difficult time recommending the Atlas even if you <em>don't</em> have the Pro 5 or the Enduro, simply because the Enduro has been discounted to $279. But unless you <em>really</em> like the differences in the casing, save yourself a few bucks and get the Enduro.</p><p>Hopefully, Qualcomm will release a new wearable chip, giving Mobvoi the opportunity to go back to the drawing board. Heck, if it could re-release the Atlas with a new chip and Wear OS 5, I'd be happy. Well, as long as it meant that I could finally use Google Assistant.</p>

<ul><li>Google is reportedly working on adding Veo 2's video-generation capabilities in its Gemini app.</li><li>The model could give users a way to create short video clips, which will leverage Veo 2's high-quality generation software.</li><li>Google highlighted Veo 2 in December with its high-quality 4K resolution and its ability to understand a user's complex descriptions.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A report claims Google is working to bring a little more video-generation magic to Gemini in an upcoming update.</p><p>As spotted in an APK dive by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/24/gemini-app-veo-video-generation/">9to5Google</a>, the company has reportedly started adding code to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini app</a> in preparation for Veo 2. The post claims development has been ongoing over the "past several weeks," but the recently spotted code gives a little more to chew on. The publication discovered a description reading that states users will be able to "describe" their idea and "Veo 2 will bring it to life with an 8-second video."</p><p>After generating, similar to having the AI make an image, users may be able to download their AI-generated clip. Additionally, code evidence lends the publication to believe there will be a video player, as well (which would make sense).</p><p>Elsewhere, the post highlights the potential for Google to impose a "limit" on how many videos users can create in Gemini using Veo 2. One string states "You’ve reached your video generation limit until tomorrow." Another mentions the existence of a "monthly limit," too. More information on this is still in the dark, though there's speculation Google could push Veo 2's access behind <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-is-gemini-advanced-worth-buying">Gemini's paid tier</a>.</p><p>How this feature will exactly look and work for the end-user wasn't readily available as Google is still likely a bit early on in its development.</p>

<p>In December, after Veo's introduction at I/O 2024, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-ai-whisk-image-video-generation-updates">debuted Veo 2</a>, which was an updated version of the model that would let users generate "incredibly high-quality" videos. The company stated users could use their imagination and create videos covering a wide range of styles and subjects. The max resolution of Veo 2's videos were reportedly 4K and the AI model even has the capability to understand your complex queries/descriptions.</p><p>Since December, Veo 2 has been placed in Google Labs' VideoFX test and remains there still. Rumors of video-generation arriving in Gemini <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-might-be-prepping-ai-video-generation-for-a-future-update">started in February</a>. The early code was much more barebones than what we're seeing reported today; however, it seems Google is still on track to deliver it.</p><p>Meanwhile, Google has been slowly stepping more and more into video generation, especially when you consider <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/made-by-youtube-2024-ai-hype-updates">YouTube's interest in Veo</a>. A Made by YouTube update in September highlighted the platform's interest in Google's DeepMind AI video-generation software to help its creators. It showcased work toward placing Veo's capabilities in Shorts creation.</p><p>This would generate a six-second clip for creators to use in their Shorts to enhance them with new concepts. Moreover, Google recently rolled out an update for its Vids app, which lets it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-vids-can-now-generate-ai-voiceovers-for-your-videos">create AI-generated voiceovers</a> for your projects. This can be utilized through the Vids app's "Help me create" prompt for its AI assistance. It's worth noting that this is rolling out for Workspace customers in a wide range of tiers and plans.</p>

<p>Google’s lineup of phones is becoming bloated, and I think the company should have merged the Pixel 9 and 9a into one phone and changed specs and pricing options.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/pixel-9a-arrives-with-a-fresh-new-look">9a launched on March 19,</a> coming with a new design and ditching the usual pill-shaped aluminum camera bar for a flat rear panel. Priced at $499, the phone comes with AI features, including Gemini Live, Add Me, Magic Editor, the Tensor G4 chip, and seven years of OS and security updates. <br><br>So, with all of these great features at a fantastic price, why should anyone bother buying the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a" target="_blank">Pixel 9</a> (starting at $799) when it seems the 9a has similar, if not better, features and is $300 cheaper?</p><p>Like my colleague, Andrew Myrick, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/there-are-too-many-pixel-phones">wrote last year</a>, it’s time for Google to rethink its lineup of devices and streamline its offerings.</p><p>And it turns out I'm not the only one who thinks Google needs to revamp its Pixel lineup. So does Android Authority <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-needs-to-rethink-pixel-phones-3535200/">in their recent article</a>. That said, I don't know if I agree that Google should take the iPhone route with its lineup.</p>

<p>I asked Google if there were really enough consumers to justify releasing a Pixel 9 and a 9a, and I was told there was.</p><p>“When we look at our devices, the goal is really to deliver the core Pixel experience and deliver on that incredible camera, the incredible Google AI, and then access to the latest version of Android. [Pixel] 9 is leveling off of those experiences. So there’s a significant boost in image quality, based on the sensors we use in 9, and the capabilities of that camera are quite better than what we have in the A series.”</p><p>“Similarly, from a charging perspective, we find that the 9 serves a user that may be looking for that faster charging experience. And then finally, the display on our 9 devices tends to be of a higher quality than what’s on our A series,” said Shenaz Zack Mistry, senior director of product management for Pixel.</p><p>Google says that there is a user that might want a little more and that from their “portfolio perspective…we have just as many users on that premium tier as we do in our entry tier. So we do believe there’s users in both of those categories.”</p>

<p>The Pixel 9 launched in September 2024, giving consumers at least six months with a phone that has very similar features to the new 9a.</p><p>Per this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-vs-pixel-9">Pixel 9a vs. Pixel 9</a> comparison chart, you can see that there are several features that the 9a has that are similar to or even better than the 9, but the phone launches much later than the 9. This means consumers will have to wait for a cheaper phone with Pro-like features and specs.</p>

<p>Senior editor Andrew Myrick made a point when the Pixel launched its 9 series that the company has too many Pixel phones, saying that it might be “a bit overwhelming to some.” Making a similar argument that the A series is priced much lower than the regular base Pixel.</p><p>So, I think Google should have merged the 9 and 9a and offered a much better phone at a reasonable price point somewhere between the two, which would allow Google to still get a great ROI.</p><p>The Pixel 9 is able to perform well because of the higher RAM, and as a result, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> features work seamlessly and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">on-device</a>, a lacking feature in the 9a. I think the blended phone should have a higher RAM to offer the features the 9a isn’t able to do so, but at the same time, it should still offer the other compromises that keep the phone from performing at a Pro level and, therefore, keeping the price down.</p><p>I personally do not think that many people care about wireless charging, so maintaining wireless charging at the 9a level, in my opinion, is fine and, as a result, does not require more expensive components to increase the cost of the overall phone.</p><p>The blended phone would have the 9a battery size and the same camera features as the 9, but if Google wanted to save on some cost, then using cheaper sensors might be smart, for example.</p><p>Since the processor is the same for both phones, you know the blended phone will still be of top quality.</p><p>The most important thing here is the price of the phone. This merged phone would cost around $600 or $650; the perfect in-between while still keeping it fairly affordable. In fact, if Google needs an example of how to make an affordable flagship-like phone, it only needs to look at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-vs-oneplus-13r">OnePlus 13R</a>, which offers incredible value and specs for the price.</p>

<p>I know that my reality of what I want from Google may not happen. However, I do think that Google needs to figure out its strategy between the two phones.</p><p>Jitesh Ubrani, research manager for IDC's Worldwide Mobile Device Trackers, agrees.</p><p>He said in 2024, Pixel shipments grew 5.9%, and in the year prior grew 55.4%. I’m going to guess the increase in sales in 2023 was because of the launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8">Pixel 8 series</a>, which included Google’s suite of AI features for the first time in a lineup of phones.</p><p>Urbani notes that the share of the Pixel A series has generally been shrinking for the past few years and accounted for 32.1% (almost a third) in 2024. Meanwhile, the share of base Pixel has only trended down slightly while the Pro and Fold versions have gained a share, he said.</p><p>That said, Ubrani notes that while the A series market share is shrinking, there still is a need for the A series because it represents a significant share of Pixels in markets. Assuming the A series continues to shrink in share, Ubrani says that then, in the next few iterations, it may make sense to discontinue it.</p><p>“However, it’s important to realize that the A series doesn’t just bring in a different customer due to the significantly lower price point, it also provides a healthy bump to overall Pixel brand marketing during the year when there’s usually a bit of a slump in the middle of the year,” he said.</p><p>So, if we were to continue with the trajectory of a base Pixel model and one that is part of the A series, then I think Google really needs to figure out a way to differentiate the base model.</p><p>We know from some recent leaks that the Pixel 10 will have a few more upgrades that make it stand out a little more than it has in the past. The biggest potential change is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-series-render-leak-reveal-identical-design">a triple-camera setup</a>.</p><p>And if Google choses to include that third camera, then it has to make sure that a third camera isn’t also happening in a future Pixel 10a, otherwise, we’ll be back to square one of what is the point of having these two phones.</p>

<ul><li>Google's Japan X account has started teasing an upcoming collaboration with K-Pop girl group, BABYMONSTER.</li><li>The collab will bring an "Imagination Studio" to fans in Shibuya, Japan on March 29.</li><li>Google became the official smartphone of the Australian Open earlier this year, which saw it bring the Pixel Studio to life for fans to engage with.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is teasing something new going on with its Pixel ecosystem later this week overseas.</p><p>The company's Japanese account has started <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/googlejapan/status/1903748557318070550">posting teaser images</a> on X of what's to come, beginning with one that spells the date: March 29, 2025 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/24/google-teases-new-pixel-imagination-studio-coming-on-march-29/#more-666177">9to5Google</a>). In this first image, Google provided a photo of "Google Pixel;" however, the "P" in Pixel sports a couple of devilish (or monstrous) horns. Moreover, the post is accompanied by seven emojis, six of them and multicolored hearts with one that's a purple imp.</p><p>Users quickly replied, tossing in their assumptions behind what was being teased, to which they claimed it was BABYMONSTER, a South Korean Girl group (K-Pop).</p><p>Google followed up recently with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/googlejapan/status/1904095846427148558">one more post</a> from its Japanese account with more solid evidence for users' speculation. The machine-translated post says "Monster pop-up coming soon." Additionally, the photo teases something called "Imagination Studio" and the location of the pop-up store in Shibuya, Japan. Google also showcases seven silhouettes at the bottom of its image, which shows off the seven members of BABYMONSTER: Rami, Ahyeon, Chiquita, Asa, Rora, Pharita, and Ruka.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">モンスター級のポップアップ、もうすぐ。#GooglePixel pic.twitter.com/mQkFu3Isye<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1904095846427148558">March 24, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Aside from the images to get people excited, Google didn't offer anything more on what "Imagination Studio" could be. The company also doesn't explain if this studio will be the sole purpose of this pop-up event. The publication speculates it could have something to do with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-pixel-studio">Pixel Studio</a> and its recent ability to "generate images with people." That remains to be seen but, luckily, we don't have to wait that long.</p><p>In the meantime, Google kicked off a collaboration with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-is-the-official-smartphone-of-the-australian-open">the Australian Open</a>, becoming its official smartphone in an attempt to reach a more global audience. To celebrate, at the beginning of January, the company set up a real-life Pixel Studio at Rod Laver Arena. It gave fans a chance to get hands-on with the Pixel 9 Pro's features, which also boasted a suite of AI features.</p><p>Google also provided expert "coaches" to assist fans in capturing their best shots and appropriately utilize the Pixel 9 Pro's AI editing tools.</p>

<ul><li>Wear OS 5.1 update seems to be messing up some features on the Pixel Watch 3 and Watch 2.</li><li>Users have reported delayed notifications, inaccurate step counts, battery issues, and more.</li><li>While Google has yet to acknowledge the bugs, restarting or factory resetting the wearable seems to temporarily fix some of the issues.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The March Wear OS update is rolling out, and it has already started causing some issues for users. The Wear OS 5.1 update seems to be delaying notifications, inaccurately showing steps, causing battery issues, and more (first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-pixel-watch-march-2025-update-brings-delayed-notifications-bugs/">Android Police</a>).</p><p>Since Mar. 18, Google has been pushing out the Wear OS 5.1 update for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a>, Pixel Watch 2, and the original Pixel Watch. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/google-lte-pixel-watches-wear-os-5-1-rollout-spotted">broader rollout to LTE watches</a> happened last week, with the LTE Pixel Watch 2 and 3 seeing version <strong>BP1A.250305.019.W3</strong> and the O.G device seeing <strong>BP1A.250305.019.W2</strong> version of the update come in.</p><p>At the start of March, Google announced the feature rollout to wearables, with the new Loss of Pulse and menstrual health support coming to the Pixel Watch 3. Other watches received tweaks to features that improved audio controls, step count tracking, and expansion of auto bed-time mode.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3061px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="5xtzUTUEH7f4PQTujsfYi5" name="pixel-watch-3-myfitnesspal-app" alt="The MyFitnessPal app on the Google Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5xtzUTUEH7f4PQTujsfYi5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3061" height="1722" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But it looks like the patch brought some unexpected bugs as well to these watches. Over the weekend, those who updated their watch to the latest firmware seem to be facing all kinds of issues with their wearables. Several people took to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://old.reddit.com/r/PixelWatch/comments/1jhzriq/anyone_else_facing_issues_with_pixel_watch_3/">Reddit</a> to express their frustration about this rather messy update that has made their watches slower than usual.</p><p>Several Pixel Watch 2 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-3-gets-fda-approval-for-loss-of-pulse-detection-in-us">Pixel Watch 3 </a>owners reported that notifications seemed to be delayed and were only displayed when the user manually wakes the watch, after which they are flooded by multiple notifications all at once.</p><p>Other users feel that the update has messed up their step counter — the watch seems to be counting steps and detecting floors climbed, even when the user has taken it off. It also seems to be detecting way more steps than usual, according to another user who said they only walked 5K steps, but the watch seems to have tracked about 17K.</p><p>Additionally, these bugs have supposedly started draining the watch's battery. The publication added that some users have been dealing with the watch crashing when all they did was try to change or edit a watch face's complications or colors.</p><p>For now, users on the same Reddit thread seem to have come up with a workaround to solve this issue. They said factory resetting the watch seems to be solving some of these issues, while some feel that simply restarting the watch does the job, but only temporarily.</p>

<p>On the other hand, some users thanked the Google gods as they didn't face any of the above issues with the new update. For now, Google hasn't officially acknowledged the issue. However, Android Central has reached out to the company and will update this article once we have more information.</p>

<p>The Nexode Power Bank Genshin Impact Edition is a 2000mAh power bank with three charging ports in total, with a cumulative power budget of 130W. The facade of the power bank has a Kinich-themed design along with K'uhul Ajaw, and it looks pretty distinctive — much more so than the regular model. The sides have Scions of the Canopy and Yumkasaurus graffiti, and the bottom has a pixelized K'uhul Ajaw.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="hjnAkuZrH2dw7ZPjCfZaP3" name="UGREEN Genshin Impact" alt="UGREEN x Genshin Impact collection" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hjnAkuZrH2dw7ZPjCfZaP3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The design is definitely attention-grabbing, and even the USB-C connectors are decked out in green. Thankfully, you still get a panel showcasing real-time charging and battery level, and it makes using it that much more convenient. I used the 20000mAh and 25000mAh Nexode power banks quite a bit in the last six months, and they're now my go-to choice while traveling.</p>

<p>The USB-C1 port hits 100W, with the USB-C2 going up to 30W, and USB-A hitting 22.5W. It does a good job charging up to three devices at once, and I didn't have any problems with the Pixel 9 Pro XL, Xiaomi 15 Ultra, and Vivo X200 Pro. The regular 20000mAh Nexode power bank <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-20000mAh-Portable-Charger-Charging/dp/B0CXHNGDC1">is down to $63 on Amazon</a>, so you are paying a little extra to get the variant with the Kinich styling. That said, it's still a great choice, and the product itself is identical to the standard 130W model that I've used extensively.</p>

<p>UGREEN's best-selling product is the Nexode 65W charger, so it isn't too astonishing that the brand chose this particular model to get a Genshin makeover. The only issue I have with the Nexode Charger Genshin Impact Edition is that the Nexode Pro is a better choice overall, and the brand should have used that as the foundation instead.</p>

<p>Regardless, the Nexode 65W is still a strong GaN charger, and it has dual USB-C ports alongside a USB-A port. UGREEN also sells another model with a UK plug, and the small size makes it a good recommendation if you need a travel-friendly charger. The regular Nexode 65W charger <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Gallium-Nitride-Charger-Black/dp/B091BGMKYS">is down to $25</a>, and the Genshin-styled variant can be bought for $39.</p>

<p>It's great to see Qi2 charging accessories gaining momentum, and this 2-in-1 is effective at charging a phone over Qi2 as well as an accessory. The best part is that it has a USB-C port on the side, so you can charge a third device as well, albeit at 5W.</p>

<p>The design is pretty cool, with the charging stand featuring the Yumkasaurus pattern and Kinich’s Elemental Skill aiming frame. The foldable design is ideal for portability, and it has a good swivel action — I had no issues using it with the iPhone 16 Pro Max. The regular product usually costs $38, and the Genshin model is now available for $59.</p>

<p>It's always good to see a colorful USB-C cable, and UGREEN decked out the braided cable in a bright green hue, with a K'uhul Ajaw cable tie and Dendro styling at the connectors. It goes up to 100W over USB PD, and is available in a single 1-meter variant. At $9, it's just as affordable as the regular model.</p>

<p>UGREEN sent the new products in a custom gift box that's designed to look like a loot chest, and it is extravagant. The brand did a brilliant job with the packaging in general; I unboxed limited-edition phones that didn't have anywhere close to this level of attention to detail.</p>

<p>As to why the brand went with Kinich, UGREEN says: "As a skilled Saurian Hunter, Kinich is steady, direct, and efficient in combat. These qualities align with UGREEN’s brand identity and mission. The cobranded products excel in charging speed, providing gamers and users with an efficient and reliable charging experience. Kinich wields the power of Dendro and his character design primarily uses green, aligning with UGREEN’s brand colors. The pixelation in his design also matches with the digital nature of UGREEN's electronics."</p>

<p>In addition to the Genshin Impact-branded accessories, UGREEN bundled a set of add-ons, including a phone grip, power bank pouch, lanyard, and acrylic stands. It definitely makes unboxing the packaging more of an occasion, and I like that all the products have a distinct green styling.</p>

<p>While the packaging is noteworthy in its own right, UGREEN mentions that the Genshin Impact merchandise and the gift box won't be available at retail. However, the brand is running giveaways on its site and social media channels. Overall, UGREEN did all the right things with the collaboration, and while you are paying more solely based on the aesthetics, the products are distinctive to say the least.</p>

<ul><li>WhatsApp’s new “Layout” feature enables users to share collaged photos as status updates, similar to Instagram’s Stories.</li><li>Users can select from multiple grid options to share up to six photos from their Android gallery.</li><li>The feature is currently hidden and in testing, with a demo showcasing its potential appearance and functionality.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>WhatsApp was found testing a new feature that is popular on Meta's other social media platforms like Instagram. The feature allows users to share collaged pics as status updates.</p><p>According to an APK Insight performed by folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/whatsapp-layouts-status-update-apk-teardown-3536549/">Android Authority</a>, the messaging app was seen using a new “Layout” feature, which helps users pick a collage layout to post multiple pictures at once while sharing them as status updates. It is similar to Instagram’s Stories feature as it also supports layout photo sharing format.</p><p>With the new upcoming WhatsApp feature, the aim here is to keep the status updates cleaner than clumsy as is the case now when users want to share multiple photos at once. The Layout feature allows users to share up to six photos at once and they can be picked up from their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a>’s gallery, and it additionally provides multiple grid options to choose from.</p>

<p>While currently hidden, the feature's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/8TF21z_Xk8U">showcased demo</a> by the publication gives us an idea of how the "Layouts" will supposedly look when it rolls out to the masses shortly.</p><p>Users can head over to the status page and hit the camera icon, which takes them to the phone’s gallery the Layout option should be seen right next to the “voice” and “music” options, and they can add the preferred six photos and choose from the provided grid styles. The final status update screen, however, remains to be seen as the feature is still in the testing phase.</p><p>WhatsApp Status has seen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-gets-status-liking-feature-and-private-mentions">significant improvements</a> over the past few months. They've started allowing users to like the status updates alongside allowing users to privately mention their friends from the contacts, who can further repost the update as their status update. All these features are also borrowed from Instagram, and the upcoming new one might soon be added to that list.</p>

<p>Samsung Galaxy users in the U.S. have been waiting for the One UI 7 on their devices as the company announced the stable operating system rollout for April 10 in the region. However, it now seems unlikely as Samsung deleted the announcement post (spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammyfans.com/2025/03/21/samsung-us-deletes-one-ui-7-april-rollout-post/amp/">SammyFans</a>).</p><p>Last week, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/one-ui-7-update-comes-to-galaxy-phones-on-april-10-in-us">said</a> that Galaxy phone users in the U.S. will be receiving the One UI 7 stable build starting April 10 with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">Galaxy S24</a> series, the Galaxy Z Fold 6, and Z Flip 6 handsets. The release date is already delayed by three days as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-will-be-releasing-one-ui-7-on-april-7">global rollout</a> is intended to happen on April 7, according to a previous announcement from the brand.</p>

<p>The release date was announced through a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-one-ui-7-announces-official-rollout-starting-from-april-7-2025/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=usnews&utm_campaign=general">Samsung U.S. newsroom post</a>, which was sadly pulled by the company for reasons unspecified. The page is nowhere to be seen. However, other related newsroom posts indicating an April 7 release date remain intact — except for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/ca/samsung-announces-official-rollout-of-one-ui-7-starting-from-april-10-in-canada">Canada blog post</a>, which interestingly has an April 10 release date.</p><p>Regardless, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a> is a highly anticipated update for Galaxy phone users as it brings a host of improvements over the previous iteration. The initial rollout was slated alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-launch">Galaxy S25 series</a> launch in January this year, but things, however, didn’t materialize. Later, the announcement was confirmed in April with the company releasing the announcement details, as mentioned before.</p>

<p>On the other hand, SammyFans notes that some of the social posts on X indicating the rollout of One UI 7 on the Samsung US account are nowhere to be found. A post dated March 20 still appears to be live on X, however, the attached announcement post link redirects to a “no page found” window.</p><p>It appears Samsung users in the U.S. might have to wait a little bit more than other users across regions — but that isn't anything new.</p>

<p>I'm not an expert on the EU Digital Markets Act, which, as of this week, requires Apple to make exclusive Apple Watch features available on third-party watches. Nor can I predict whether or not Apple will subvert or defy the ruling. But I <em>can</em> speak to how transformative this could be for fitness smartwatches — eventually — if Apple is forced to comply.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/competition/digital_markets_act/cases/202512/DMA_100203_1536.pdf" target="_blank">DMA decision on March 19</a> lists out how Apple must provide "effective interoperability" to let any connected device "receive, access, use, respond to, and transmit iOS notifications as well as to select and manage which notifications are displayed."</p><p>Third-party watches would receive "background execution" access, so notifications and replies don't require the companion app running in the foreground as an intermediary. They'd also access faster data transfer (aka AirPlay) and settings like Do Not Disturb and priority notifications.</p><p>Apple will, of course, fight this tooth and nail. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/632718/europe-digital-markets-act-apple-interoperability-smartwatches">The Verge</a> quotes an Apple spokesperson as saying, "Today’s decisions wrap us in red tape...forcing us to give away our new features for free to companies who don’t have to play by the same rules. We will continue to work with the European Commission to help them understand our concerns."</p><p>Just as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/eu-commission-finds-that-google-search-and-play-store-fail-to-comply-with-dma">Google failed to comply with the DMA</a>, Apple may decide not to follow the ruling. But let's play out the hypothetical here and envision how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness smartwatches</a> (and <em>non</em>-fitness watches) could evolve with full iOS and Android access.</p>
<h2 id="garmin-is-the-smartest-fitness-brand-and-it-can-only-do-so-much-2">Garmin is the "smartest" fitness brand, and it can only do so much</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="jUNVoitpCtXTVbsvFDP6oX" name="Garmin-Fenix-8-voice-assistant" alt="The Garmin Fenix 8 showing "Listening" for the new voice assistant" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jUNVoitpCtXTVbsvFDP6oX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Garmin represents the rare fitness brand that tries to sell "smart" mainstream watches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review">Venu 3</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Fenix 8</a>, with smart assistants, Garmin Pay, and a few third-party apps like Spotify and YouTube Music.</p><p>However, Garmin only pulled off a mini-walled garden of smarts and apps the same way Fitbit did before its Google acquisition. Both brands were so successful that they had the gravity to bring major apps to the bargaining table.</p><p>Garmin also used its higher cash flow to acquire businesses like Firstbeat Analytics and FitPay for a smarter training algorithm and contactless payments. Most fitness brands can't get third-party payment services to support them.</p><p>And because Garmin has an eclectic mix of iPhone and Android customers — its latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/newsroom/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2024-Q4-GRMN-Earnings-Release_Final.pdf">earnings</a> show more than half of its sales come in Europe and Asia, where <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> are more popular — it supports a couple of basic Android-only smart features, most notably quick replies to Google Messages and the ability to see images in notifications. Apple blocks both (for now).</p><p>But despite all that effort and its advantages, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a> isn't that advanced for messaging, turn-by-turn navigation, voice commands, and other tricks you get on watchOS or Wear OS. That applies double to brands like COROS, Polar, Suunto, and Whoop, which lack the same reach or leverage.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2037px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="8UnRaxseeEikjEUVcfHW9K" name="pebble-core-duo-2-time-2-smartwatches-hero" alt="A rendering depicting Core Devices' new PebbleOS smartwatches: the Core 2 Duo and the Time 2." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8UnRaxseeEikjEUVcfHW9K.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2037" height="1146" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The new Pebble watches will be limited when connected to iOS </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Core Devices)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I'm excited to try the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/core-devices-core-2-duo-time-2-pebble-watches-launch">new Pebble watches</a>, but former Pebble founder Eric Migicovsky had to "set expectations" on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ericmigi.com/blog/apple-restricts-pebble-from-being-awesome-with-iphones">his blog</a> about how Apple's policies hamstring them. Pebble watches on iOS can't offer to message, mark tasks as done, ignore notifications you've seen on your phone, support background execution, or create their own mini-app store for third-party watch faces and functions.</p><p>In his case, he says upfront that the definitive way to use a Pebble watch is to pair it with an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a>. However, 40% of his interested customers use an iPhone; Apple's ecosystem is too large to simply ignore it.</p><p>Even most of the old Wear OS brands — Samsung Galaxy, Mobvoi TicWatch, and Fossil — were "compatible" with iPhones for years. But they had such limited functionality thanks to Apple's uncompetitive practices that they've mostly given up and turned to Google's semi-walled Wear OS garden to survive, or (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fossil-group-quits-making-smartwatches">in Fossil's case</a>) given up on smartwatches.</p><p>They could only "work" on iOS because they had health and fitness tools independent of their blocked smarts. And every other non-Apple watch for iPhones has been funneled down this path.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sqdFhWDNv7iqLQVbhPhjXH" name="Garmin Fenix 8 vs. Galaxy Watch Ultra 3" alt="Garmin Fenix 8 vs. Galaxy Watch Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sqdFhWDNv7iqLQVbhPhjXH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael L Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I believe that Apple's policies have (unintentionally) helped make smartwatches much stronger for health and fitness across the industry. After Pebble shut down, brands knew they couldn't make creative lifestyle watches without close phone integration for apps and messaging. So they focused on a use case that Apple couldn't restrict and turned a weakness into a strength with low-powered watches that lasted weeks.</p><p>If this ruling takes effect, it would change the entire industry. Yes, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watches</a> would be unleashed to encroach on rival territory. And smaller, health-focused brands like Masimo and Withings suddenly gain access to greater smarts. But we could also see watches that emphasize something <em>other</em> than fitness now that they can.</p><p>The obvious example would be a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-leaked-smartwatch-with-brain-signal-tech-would-be-perfect-match">Meta watch</a> with the Meta AI assistant and EMG band for contextual commands and gesture recognition, unrestricted by Apple's policies. But I'd hope to see more indie brands like Repebble shoot their shot and try smart gimmicks that I've never even conceived of without the same pressure to add reliable health data or fitness coaching.</p>
<h2 id="a-distant-and-unlikely-interoperable-future-2">A distant and unlikely interoperable future</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="VbBmCdQNRuocVTfNQAaNuZ" name="Four-watches-20-mile-running-test" alt="The Apple Watch Ultra 2, Garmin Fenix 8, COROS PACE Pro, and Google Pixel Watch 3 sitting on a bookshelf together, all showing a post-run summary for a 20-mile race that day." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VbBmCdQNRuocVTfNQAaNuZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I don't know how much fitness smartwatches will change if Apple obeys this ruling. Yes, background refreshes, closer syncing with your DND settings, interactive replies, and quicker file transfers would benefit any fitness smartwatch. But not every smartwatch is optimized to <em>use</em> messaging.</p><p>They'll need mics for voice-to-text or AMOLED displays with faster touch sampling. This probably wouldn't be possible on watches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-cant-decide-if-the-garmin-instinct-3-is-a-triumph-or-a-letdown">Garmin Instinct 3</a>, optimized for long battery life with a slower processor. Maybe Garmin would restrict messaging to its lifestyle watches and prioritize battery life on its Forerunners and Instincts.</p><p>Crucially, Garmin (and other brands) would be able to decide to stick to their strengths instead of Apple deciding for them. If they prioritized faster performance, this would benefit both iOS and Android users; a better chip and more widespread assistant would make RCS messaging better, too.</p><p>Of course, the original point still stands. This isn't like changing from Lightning to USB-C or allowing sideloading; it would fundamentally change the entire operating system, and Apple could spend years disputing the ruling. Then, fitness watches would have to license more robust hardware and test the software. Who knows how long that could take?</p><p>But <em>if</em> it does happen, it would certainly make things more exciting and competitive for smartwatch fans, whichever smartphone they own!</p>

Combined with social media reports that most top-selling Quest devs were "rejected" from Google's Android XR boot camps, it's painting a worrying picture about what to expect from Android-based headsets like Project Moohan.</p><p>Google <em>loves</em> GDC; it has a huge presence there every year. This year, its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/game-ai-summit-beyond-the-hype-real-world-applications-of-google-ai-in-gaming-presented-by-google/911129">panel</a> on real-world AI applications in game development filled up 45 minutes before it started. It had several Android gaming panels and a large Play Store exhibition in the West hall, and it partnered with Samsung on another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/adaptive-game-performance-with-samsung-galaxy-presented-by-samsung-electronics/911713">Galaxy panel</a>.</p><p>GDC is well-known for its private hotel demos off the show floor. Perhaps Google made an Android XR push behind closed doors with larger VR publishers.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="n7FVgACrRhCezAF3qFYooH" name="GDC-2024-logo.jpeg" alt="A large GDC logo on the show floor" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n7FVgACrRhCezAF3qFYooH.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But Google's decision not to court indie VR devs publicly with panels or demos — at the same conference where Meta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-v74-feature-is-set-to-revolutionize-immersive-experiences">pushed its new passthrough tech</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/gdc-2025-oculus-publishing-head-challenges-meta-criticism-on-quest-store-profitability">reassured devs how profitable their store is</a> — seems pretty telling.</p><p>It's all but guaranteed that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-io-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">Google I/O 2025</a> program in May will have workshops on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a> — to court 2D <em>app</em> devs. Gaming rarely comes up at I/O, and this platform is public, so it's not as though Google needs to wait for some big reveal.</p><p>Will Google have the same disdainful approach to VR gaming that Apple does with the Apple Vision Pro? At least one VR gaming dev we spoke to thinks that Android XR is already heading in the wrong direction by spurning the people who made Quest headsets so popular.</p>

<p>The Quest Store is flooded with meme games, social multiplayer targeting teens, and indie content you'd typically see on Steam. It turns off many VR elites and frustrates VR devs making "serious" content, but these games strike a chord and keep people returning to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s">Quest 3S</a> headsets more regularly to spend money.</p><p>Android XR is compatible with Unity, OpenXR, and WebXR, with controller support built into the UI. During our press preview, they suggested that headsets like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Samsung's Project Moohan</a> "support gaming use cases." They said that "hopefully" this universal compatibility "will lead to incentives for people to port over to Android."</p><p>You'd think the owner of the Play Store would recognize the power of smaller developers to strike it big and reach out to those developers to give Android XR greater visibility.</p><p>Instead, according to developer RJ White at Soaring Roc Studio, "9/10 top devs for the Quest platform" have been rejected from Android XR coding boot camps, and he sees this as a premature death knell for the platform.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I've seen 9/10 top devs for the Quest platform rejected for @GoogleARVR's bootcamps for Android XR now. I'm talking about devs / people with games that were in the top 5 top selling.

<p>"Google is treading the same path towards failure that they did with Stadia and Daydream. By shutting out some of the most experienced and smaller studios and developers, they're showing they've learned zero lessons with how to manage or grow a modern software platform," said White in a discussion with Android Central senior editor Nick Sutrich.</p><p>White, whose indie studio has made several Quest titles like Spiders and FireZone, says that studios and games from "humble origins" power huge successes from major platforms. However, he believes Google is "too focused on trying to force a polished diamond out of a large team as quickly as possible" instead of "cultivating an environment that lets those smaller teams thrive and carve a gem out on their own."</p><p>"XR developers aren't just game developers; they're <strong>3D interaction experts</strong>," says White. However, by rejecting them and prioritizing the same "just make things flat" approach as Apple, Android XR will be "2D dependent to a fault."</p>

<p>White's thoughts don't prove Android XR is bound to fail, and we don't have evidence that Google is fully ignoring Quest developers beyond word of mouth.</p><p>Rather, it reflects a perspective among some VR developers that without overtures from Google, it's hard to know how much stock to put into Android XR — or whether Google knows what it needs to do to make it successful.</p><p>Big Tech wants to make productivity XR headsets the new alternative to laptops, but none of the big-name consumer products have sold at a massive scale. Apple allegedly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/12/08/analysis-apple-vision-pro-sells-well-but-needs-more-content-faster">sold 500,000 Vision Pros</a>, and Samsung wants to sell 100,000 Moohan headsets.</p><p>VR gaming remains the one definitive use case that has attracted millions of users. So, is there a reason why Google wouldn't prioritize it?</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3877px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6gGYa9Lf8aLaVXVCa9G4Eg" name="Samsung-Project-Moohan-MWC-2025-1" alt="Samsung Project Moohan on display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6gGYa9Lf8aLaVXVCa9G4Eg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3877" height="2181" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung's Project Infinity headset is rumored to have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-could-use-sony-4k-micro-oled-displays-in-project-moohan-headset">Sony-made micro-OLED displays</a> with 13.64 million pixels per eye, arriving in the second half of 2025 with a hefty price tag. Beyond that, other announced Android XR devices include a Sony enterprise headset that'll cost almost $5,000, Xreal AR glasses, and an unconfirmed Lynx XR headset that may trend toward the pricey side.</p><p>So perhaps Google wants to focus its outreach to the enterprise and productivity app creators because it knows people won't spend thousands of dollars to play Gorilla Tag when the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Quest 3</a> is already here. It needs a "killer app" to justify its existence, and Google must assume that app won't be a game.</p><p>Maybe Google truly believes that gaming developers don't <em>need</em> an Android XR boot camp because they can easily port over OpenXR games without much effort.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="4RfgxtFQxgSCTz5o6LSq3j" name="Headset_GooglePhotos-project-moohan-android-xr" alt="Running Google Photos in mixed reality on Samsung Project Moohan, powered by Android XR" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4RfgxtFQxgSCTz5o6LSq3j.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="281" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Perhaps, as White suggests, they're underestimating these XR developers' ability to do <em>more</em> than gaming software and create useful 3D app content, whether for headsets or AR glasses. We know Android XR will have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr-headsets-will-take-vital-camera-option-from-android-phones">similar camera tech to the Quest's new passthrough API</a>, but Google didn't come to GDC to appeal to XR devs as Meta did.</p><p>Or maybe Google is following the lead of its hardware partners, who don't care as much about gaming. If Samsung decides to make a Quest rival, <em>then</em> Google could prioritize gaming, right?</p><p>Frankly, whatever Google's reasoning, I'm not a fan of Google potentially downplaying the importance of gaming for the future of Android XR. It should be building up momentum now so that devs are ready to overload Project Moohan with content by the end of the year.</p><p>Hopefully, by Google I/O in May, VR gaming devs will have more reason for optimism that Android XR is a viable new platform for them.</p>

The Meta booth was crowded with hopeful indie devs aiming to join Oculus Publishing or get some of that $50 million Horizon Worlds grant money. But most established publishers didn't pay for booths. Given the current "VR visibility crisis," I found that quite telling.</p><p>On Monday, XR industry vet Jim Squires led a panel called "Solving VR Gaming's Visibility Crisis: Strategies for Reaching Mainstream Audiences," which included the publishers behind Moss and Ghosts of Tabor, a VR marketing CEO, and IGN's executive editor.</p><p>The panel highlighted the major dip in revenue that VR developers are experiencing, both on the Quest Store and other platforms. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/gdc-2025-oculus-publishing-head-challenges-meta-criticism-on-quest-store-profitability">Meta's Oculus Publishing lead addressed this criticism</a> in a later GDC 2025 talk, claiming Meta's store changes had a "very small" impact on developer profits.</p><p>This panel took a different stance, as they explained how the money well and marketing support from these platforms dried up, leaving them to fend for themselves.</p><p>But that doesn't mean the devs behind the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">best Quest games</a> are giving up, either. This panel highlighted the new ways developers will try to reach VR gamers, sidestepping the Quest Store or other VR platforms entirely for discoverability.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="aUYAHUENVfGA2M7ZKA3nRi" name="Moss-Book-2-Foundry-Screenshot.jpeg" alt="Moss Book 2 gameplay screenshot" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aUYAHUENVfGA2M7ZKA3nRi.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1500" height="844" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Polyarc)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Polyarc publishing director Lincoln Davis shared how Sony initially took them under their wing with incredible publicity and support, recognizing that Moss would exhibit to the masses how cool VR could be.</p><p>Sony took a "shotgun approach," reaching everyone from hardcore gamers to casual non-gamers. Moss got a major E3 slot and was included at road shows, concerts, baseball and football games, store activations, billboards, Black Friday and NFL commercials, and major social media pushes, with on-the-go demos available to show people what the game (and VR) was about.</p><p>Ultimately, Davis estimates they've gotten about $42 million in ad support from publishers across multiple platforms.</p><p>But after those glory days of reach where quality meant attention, the VR platforms wanted "direct measurement" of the "return on investment." These platforms left behind the "three-steps-removed" mainstream crowds while retailers like Gamestop and Best Buy started removing the headsets that let "normal" people try VR for themselves.</p><p>Instead, Sony refocused all its marketing on the serious gamer crowd, which had already had inroads; it generally <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/sony-no-longer-cares-about-the-psvr-2-and-you-shouldnt-either">hasn't given the PSVR 2 the same level of attention</a> as the original, which multiple panelists bemoaned. Meta, meanwhile, prioritized PR for the hardware, or for self-owned games like Beat Saber or Supernatural.</p><p>Of course, as IGN's executive editor Ryan McCaffrey explained, it's "very much an uphill battle" to get their core audience to click on articles about VR games, especially "original IP." Outside of well-known franchises like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/batman-arkham-shadow-review">Batman: Arkham Shadow</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/alien-rogue-incursion-meta-quest-3-review">Alien: Rogue Incursion</a>, gamers won't engage with VR content. Whether it's Sony or devs themselves, relying on the gaming press to reach your audience may not work.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1120px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ruCYWurxHnwPiof8L9xwyb" name="Meta-Quest-3-promo-image-2024-bestsellers" alt="A promo image of the Meta Quest 3 on a grid background surrounded by eight bestselling VR titles in 2024, including Gorilla Tag and Batman: Arkham Shadow." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ruCYWurxHnwPiof8L9xwyb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1120" height="630" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Long-time VR developers used to be able to count on prime Quest Store placement at launch to help them reach out to initial customers and build up reviews and momentum. Now, Squires says, store placement is no longer the "be all, end all," and he asked Maeva Sponbergs, head of publishing and CMO at Beyond Frames, how they're reaching out to audiences without being "dependent on" the Quest Store for visibility.</p><p>Sponbergs likened VR's current "discoverability problem" to what happens on Steam, the iOS App Store, and the Android Play Store. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Quest 3</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s">Quest 3S</a> remain the only viable option for VR devs to make money. However, now that pretty much anyone can put their game on the Quest Store, it's harder for any one game to stand out and earn a piece of the pie, no matter how good it is.</p><p>So now, Beyond Frames has had to "switch over focus really, really quickly, using old and tried methodologies and trying to acquire users off the platform." They looked at everything from Pinterest to Facebook ads to target the older, non-gaming crowd for family-friendly fare while focusing on Reddit and Discord outreach for serious shooters like Ghosts of Tabor.</p><p>Polyarc's Davis agreed that they had to look at both core gamer outreach and unconventional marketing to keep Moss profitable years later. They're paying influencers to share games with younger audiences that don't don't use traditional media to decide what to play.</p><p>And for older audiences, they're actually reaching out to book and wine clubs that might all decide to try games together, leading to "great clickthroughs" and "great comments" for an older title that wouldn't stand out on the store.</p><p>Most interestingly, in my mind, Polyarc, Beyond Frames, and other VR devs formed a "cross-studio collaboration" where they pushed each other's games on social media and storefronts. They even provided major discounts — up to 75% — to their partners' games, without requiring that people buy their games first. It led to a "huge increase in not only revenue but also unit sales."</p>

<p>VR devs who got in on the ground floor are struggling with deflated sales, but they still have built-up reputations, old profits, or VC investments to fund new ventures and relationships with the major platforms that they can leverage while they look for alternative profits. A smaller VR studio without critical acclaim and resources will have more of an uphill battle.</p><p>Both IGN's McCaffrey and marketing expert Stephanie Greenall suggested a key way to raise awareness of VR games is to hide the fact that it's virtual to begin with. Devs who don't have a famous IP to rely on need to look for a "hook" that'll attract people's interest and do well in headlines because, otherwise, gamers won't pay attention.</p><p>That's why I suspect we'll see more small developers trying to use TikTok, Twitch, or Instagram to attract the growing teen crowd on Quest headsets, aiming to win over influencers and streamers to get their games on the map.</p><p>I'm also curious if more developers will try to band together to support each other's games. But given the lack of VR devs on the GDC show floor, I'm curious whether some of them will take an every-dev-for-themselves approach, instead.</p><p><em>Update:</em> Polyarc's Davis reached out to clarify that Sony (not Meta) included Moss in NFL ads, and that they provided discount codes to partners' games without requiring purchase first (as I mistakenly suggested). I apologize for the errors.</p>

For example, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZMFZMR8" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon has launched 30% off the Google Pixel Tablet</strong></a> just days away from its Big Spring Sale (March 25th-31st). This deal represents $120 in savings, so it might not be a bad time to pick up your next Pixel device if you were already in the market.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Google Pixel tablet</a> was highly anticipated upon its release in 2023, and it's remained a staple for those who like the Pixel ecosystem. While it's certainly not a premium tablet, the Pixel tablet upholds the cozy Google look and feel, offering decent performance backed by the Tensor G2 chip and 8GB of RAM. It also includes a 10.95-inch display, and while it's not an AMOLED screen, it still offers pretty bright, vibrant visuals.</p>

With fluid performance and a vibrant 11-inch display, the Pixel tablet lives up to the hype as far as mid-range tablets go.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZMFZMR8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="367f0391-f9cd-42a5-9b49-bcf573dea84b" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Google Pixel Tablet 128GB:" data-dimension48="Google Pixel Tablet 128GB:" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if:</strong> you like Pixel devices and need a simple mid-range tablet; you're looking for a tablet that will offer regular software update support; you want another display for controlling Google smart home devices or for integrating with your other Pixel devices.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you need a tablet with a headphone jack; you prefer a tablet with smaller bezels or one with first-party accessories; you have extra money to spend and would rather upgrade to a premium productivity or work tablet.</p><p>No surprise here; the Google Pixel Tablet was a pretty easy pick for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets#section-best-for-pixel-fans">best Android tablet for Pixel fans </a>category. From the smooth, utilitarian One UI to the easy integration with other Pixel devices, there's more than one reason why fans waited so long for this tablet to come out.</p><p>To be sure, the Pixel Tablet isn't a premium-level tablet or one best used for performance-intensive use. However, it comes with a nice 10.95-inch LCD display that remains vibrant and bright (despite not being an AMOLED), and solid performance, as supported by the 8GB of RAM and Google Tensor G2 chip. This particular deal is for the 128GB storage configuration of the tablet, though Google also offers a 256GB version.</p><p>A few downsides include the lack of a 3.5mm headphone jack, and Google's lack of a first-party stylus or keyboard cover. But for most casual users or those simply looking to add a multi-use screen to their Google smart home, the price point here is certainly worth considering.</p>

Or BlackBerry. Anyway, then came Apple.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-switched-from-iphone-to-pixel-after-12-years">iPhone</a> quickly became the industry standard for smartphones. Without offering any amazing new features, it captivated consumers in a way the existing offerings just couldn't. I spent far too much and chained myself to AT&T to get one, and there's a good chance you did, too.</p><p>This did not last. Someone at Google had the idea to try and make the smartphone more accessible to people who didn't want to or simply couldn't spend an arm and a leg with Android, and everything changed. Today, depending on the exact time of year, eight of every 10 new phones sold are powered by Android, but Apple makes more money than almost every other phone maker combined.</p>

<p>We're about to see this happen all over again with wearables. In fact, it has already begun. Last year wasn't a great year for wearable sales (or any other goods, it seems), but it was a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/wear-os-gains-as-apple-watch-declines-2024-global-smartwatch-shipments#viafoura-comments" target="_blank">particularly bad year for Apple</a>.</p><p>That doesn't mean Apple lost money, but it does mean the company saw its share of the market fall while competitor sales increased ever-so-slightly. Nor does it mean that Apple's watchOS and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-never-expected-to-love-apple-watch-ultra-2-so-much">Apple Watch</a> aren't a smashing success because the company surely made more pure profit for each watch sold than any other company could dream of doing.</p>
<p>Again, this is exactly what happened with the smartphone. Very few people bought the first Android phones. Then Motorola and HTC made some headway (with the help of U.S. carriers), and the gap narrowed until places were switched. Somehow, Apple still makes more money, even today, thanks to a supernatural manipulation of the supply chain and the idea that Android phones are for "poor" people in North America.</p><p>This is how wearables are going to play out, too. The Apple Watch is yet another product Apple makes obscene amounts of profit per unit because it's good at business, and people in the U.S., Canada, and a few enclaves around the world will rush out to buy another one the minute it's available. Basic math tells you selling 100 things and making $10 for every one of them is more than selling 200 things and only making $2 from each.</p>

<p>None of that matters to me, and none of it should matter to you. I want to love a wearable but have a hard time doing it, and when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-best-smartwatch-if-youre-wheelchair-bound">I do wear one</a>, it runs Garmin's <del>goofy</del> proprietary software, not Wear OS or watchOS. It's the one I like more than the others, and what you like is never going to matter to me. You need to do the very same thing and use whatever you like without caring what I think or which company makes more money.</p><p>It's also just the way both Apple and Google like it. One company wants numbers sold while the other wants profits per. Of course, Apple loved selling more watches than Samsung, but it loves the bottom line just as much.</p>
<p>This all weirdly makes sense. If you have 30 companies each selling a good product that people want, collectively, they will sell more than a single company that sells a similar, yet different, product. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS</a>, like Android, is a commodity like corn or crude oil that other companies use to create their own product. WatchOS is not and only available for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch</a>. A company trying to do it alone will never be the market leader when it comes to sales.</p><p>As long as Apple can capture customers in its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_distortion_field#:~:text=Reality%20distortion%20field%20(RDF)%20is,new%20world%20through%20mental%20force." target="_blank">reality distortion field</a> and keep them buying expensive products and accessories to use with them, it will do just fine.

It grew mostly out of a desire for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apple-should-release-another-ipod-touch">Apple to bring back the iPod Touch</a>, which it clearly has no interest in doing. I would frankly prefer <em>not </em>to commit to a whole-ass iPhone in order to get the iOS experience. However, if I must, then I would prefer not to spend <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a> amounts of money to do it, even if it’s the most intriguing device of the bunch.</p><p>So, I decided that I would wait for the iPhone 16e. At the time, I assumed it would fall under the iPhone SE moniker, and while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/new-iphone-se-is-tempting">the 2022 model was enticing as an iPod Touch replacement</a>, I figured I could hold out for the next model.</p><p>As the years went by, rumors would emerge about what the iPhone 16e would be. That included talk of an OLED display (finally) and a more modern design. Conflicting rumors went back and forth on whether it would have a notch or Dynamic Island, but it <em>seemed</em> like the iPhone 16e would be the cheap iPhone of my dreams.</p><p>And for a quick second, it was. Kind of.</p>

<p>When the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16e-review">iPhone 16e</a> launched, I found myself quite perplexed and at odds over the choices Apple made.</p><p>Sure, it has an OLED display for richer blacks and better contrast, but the display is stuck at 60Hz. I don’t remember the last time I used a phone with that refresh rate, and I regularly review the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best cheap Android phones</a> from companies like Motorola, phones that easily cost half the price of the iPhone 16e. Even the $399 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-stylus-5g-2024-review">Moto G Stylus 5G 2024</a> has a 120Hz OLED panel, which looks great, I might add.</p><p>Then, there’s the camera. Singular. The iPhone 16e has a single rear camera on the back, which is kind of unacceptable for a $600 phone. I’m not saying Apple should stick four cameras on the phone just for the sake of having multiple cameras, but the lack of even a secondary sensor is perplexing.</p><p>Nearly everything about the iPhone 16e was telling me not to buy it. Even Harish Jonnalagadda says in his iPhone 16e review that it's "a good phone, but a bad value right now." However, with it currently being the most affordable “new” iPhone that I can buy, I was close to pulling the trigger… that is, until the Pixel 9a launched.</p><p>The 9a pretty much affirmed my apprehensions: Apple doesn’t really know how to do value.</p>

<p>I’m not the biggest fan of Pixel phones, but I can’t deny that they’re some of the best phones you can buy. That’s why I wasn’t surprised to see that Google pretty much nailed the Pixel 9a. Based on the specs and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-hands-on">Pixel 9a hands-on</a> from Android Central senior editor Michael Hicks, the phone feels like everything the iPhone 16e should’ve been.</p><p>The phone has a larger OLED display that’s more than 2x brighter and with a faster 120Hz refresh rate. It features a secondary 13MP camera for ultrawide shots, something (I learned from using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus 2024</a>) I realized I can’t really go without.</p><p>You also get a faster USB standard on the Pixel, and while I can’t speak to battery life just yet, the 5,100mAh battery and 30+ estimation from Google sounds pretty good compared to the 4,005mAh unit <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/02/28/iphone-16e-teardown/">found in the iPhone 16e</a>.</p><p>Furthermore, Apple has also been fumbling its AI rollout, delaying its long-awaited Siri upgrade. Meanwhile, Google has been going full-stream ahead with Gemini, to the point where it’s now <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-assistant/google-assistant-becomes-gemini">prepping to replace the tried-and-true Google Assistant</a> later this year. The Pixel 9a won’t have every feature from the Pixel 9, and not all AI features will be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">processed on-device</a>, but Google’s software and AI are pretty solid, with plenty of fun features for Pixel 9a users to take advantage of.</p><p>I’ll also mention that you get more interesting color options with the Pixel, which is more than I can say for the rather bland black or white iPhone 16e.</p><p>This is all for a phone that costs $100 <em>less</em> than the iPhone 16e.</p>

<h2 id="the-iphone-16e-still-as-some-good-things-going-for-it-2">The iPhone 16e still as some good things going for it</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="3j6MWkLnr5uVRXsoxaMGzd" name="Apple iPhone 16e" alt="Apple iPhone 16e review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3j6MWkLnr5uVRXsoxaMGzd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That’s not to say the iPhone 16e doesn’t have some pretty compelling specs. The A18 chip is mighty impressive and is probably much more performant than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a>. And despite having just one camera, I've always been impressed with Apple's imaging, and it looks like it still takes great images and videos, even if you miss the option to take wider shots.</p><p>There’s no doubt Apple’s FaceID is a superior facial authentication method (although I do prefer fingerprint sensors), and the Action Button is a feature <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-made-the-right-decision-to-ditch-the-mute-switch-on-the-iphone-15-pro">I would like to see on more phones</a>.</p><p>Aesthetically, the iPhone 16e just looks a lot better. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/why-google-pixel-9a-ditched-camera-bar">new camera housing on the Pixel 9a</a> just looks awkward.</p><p>You also get more storage options with the iPhone 16e, going all the way up to 512GB. The downside is that it will obviously cost you much more, with the 128GB iPhone priced $100 higher than the 128GB Pixel 9a.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the Pixel 9a and iPhone 16a are both affordable ways to get hold of some of the latest hardware and software on both Android and iOS. If you’re already baked into one OS and holding onto a previous A-series Pixel or iPhone SE, then these may be worth upgrading to. They’re also good ways to bring in younger family members without breaking the bank on a new phone.</p><p>Harish says the iPhone 16e is aimed at "older iPhone users looking to switch to a (relatively) affordable model with the latest hardware," and this could also be said for the Pixel 9a.</p><p>That said, it feels like the Pixel 9a is a much better deal, with mostly better specs and a lower price tag for someone looking to save money on a new phone. Even if you’re an iPhone user, if you don’t have any allegiance to iOS, this is a phone worth keeping an eye on.</p><p>As for me, maybe I’ll just wait until Apple releases an iPhone 17e or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/former-iphone-users-discuss-interest-in-apple-foldable">iPhone Flip</a>.</p>

While the big pill-shaped camera bump seems to be all but gone, the phone has the same rounded aluminum side rails as its predecessors.</p><p>For its display, the Pixel 9a gets a slightly bigger 6.3-inch pOLED screen but is 35% brighter than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-vs-pixel-8a">Pixel 8a</a>. It also arrives with a massive 5,100mAh, which is larger than the standard Pixel 9 model (4700mAh). The device gets <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> out of the box, the new Tensor G4 chip, and seven years of OS and security updates. It comes with an extended battery life of up to 30 hours, faster charging, and two new colorways: Iris and Peony. Starting at $499, it has a smaller 48MP primary lens, sticks to the 13MP ultra-wide lens, and a 13MP selfie camera.</p><p>But what about Pre-orders, you ask? Google usually makes its devices available for pre-order on launch day, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-does-the-right-thing-by-delaying-pixel-9a-pre-orders">but that isn't the case with the Pixel 9a.</a> Google said in an email that the device will be going on sale sometime in April without an exact date of sale. In a statement to Android Central, Google noted a "component quality issue" affecting initial Pixel 9a units as the reason: "We're checking on a component quality issue that's affecting a small number of Pixel 9a devices."</p>

It posted its preliminary findings stating that two of Google's most used products are in breach of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-is-digital-markets-act">Digital Markets Act</a> (DMA). Legislation brought about by the European Union to regulate big tech companies so that they don't favor their products over other players on the market— leveling the playing field for other tech companies.</p><p>The report claimed two things: First, Google Search showed results favoring Google at the top of the results page rather than similar services offered by third parties. Second, app developers who contribute to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-play">Google Play Store</a> should be allowed to steer customers to cheaper options other than the ones Google controls.</p><p>Responding to this report, Google stated in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/the-eus-competition-rules-are-hurting-consumers-and-businesses/" target="_blank">blog post</a> that, while the DMA aims at being fair to all players in the market, these rules are "having the opposite effect by hurting European businesses and consumers." However the company will continue to have discussions with the EU to come to a middle ground.</p>

One UI 7 update of Galaxy devices finally has a launch date. Samsung announced this week that the official rollout for the stable version of the OS will arrive as early as April 7—for those in the company's home ground, Korea, at least.

Pebble's founder, Eric Migicovsky, in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ericmigi.com/blog/introducing-two-new-pebbleos-watches" target="_blank">a new blog post</a> announced the arrival of two new smartwatches: the Core 2 Duo and Time 2. These devices are launching under Migicovsky's new company, "Core Devices." Migicovsky states both watches are compatible with "thousands of your beloved Pebble apps."</p><p>Time 2 is a 1.5-inch e-paper display watch that will deliver "less glare and reflections" than its older watches. It has a  53% larger display with 88% more pixels,  the Time 2 contains a heart rate monitor, as well as step and sleep-tracking capabilities. Core Devices had given the watch an IPX8 rating, too. The device also sports a microphone and speaker. The Time 2 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://store.repebble.com/">available for pre-orders </a>for $225.</p><p>The second watch is the Core 2 Duo, which the company says is identical to the Pebble 2 — but it's been upgraded. This smartwatch features a smaller 1.2-inch black and white e-paper display with a lightweight polycarbonate frame and three physical buttons. Like Time 2, Core Devices states it is "targeting" an IPX8 water-resistant rating. For $149, it includes a 30-day battery life, a speaker, a barometer, and a compass sensor.</p>

<ul><li>Google Vids is adding the ability to create AI-generated voiceovers for your projects.</li><li>You could already use AI to create videos and sample scripts in Google Vids.</li><li>Now, you can form an entire project — video, scripts, and audio — with AI in Google Vids.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google Vids is a relatively new Google Workspace service that uses AI and Gemini to create videos and presentation from scratch. It's intended to be a more practical alternative to other video-generation tools, prioritizing work and school applications such as presentations, slideshows, and other types of content delivery methods. Now, Google is expanding Vids' AI capabilities with the ability to generate voiceovers, it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com" target="_blank">announced</a> this week.</p><p>After creating a video with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/we-tried-google-vids-the-new-ai-powered-video-generator-in-workspace-labs">Google Vids</a>, the "Help me Create" feature made it possible to generate a voiceover script with AI. The latest update takes things a step further, using AI to narrate the previously-generated script. Google notes the following as benefits to using Help me Create to make AI voiceovers:</p>
<ul><li>"Eliminate the manual effort of recording 'the perfect take'"</li><li>"Gain easy access to a variety of voiceovers that provide you with professional-sounding video narration"</li><li>"Save time matching voiceovers to scenes in your video with automatic audio to scene alignment"</li></ul>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1810px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:59.67%;"><img id="ZMZrFa8qNuKwwP6eM7Td6T" name="Adding new capabilities to Google Vids’ ‘Help me create’" alt="Generating a VoiceOver with Google Vids." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZMZrFa8qNuKwwP6eM7Td6T.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1810" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>After generating a sample script and AI voiceover, you can edit the script and voiceover with ease, so you aren't locked into one generation. There are different tone and pitch options to choose from, as well as unique voices. The script and voiceover options will only appear through Help me Create after opening or creating a Google Vids project.</p><p>The feature is only available to paid Google Workspace customers on the following plans:</p>
<ul><li>Business Standard and Plus</li><li>Enterprise Standard and Plus</li><li>Essentials, Enterprise Essentials and Enterprise Essentials Plus</li><li>Education Plus</li><li>Gemini Business, Enterprise, Education or Education Premium add-ons</li></ul>
<p>AI-generated voiceovers are rolling out now in Google Vids, but it could take 15 days from the feature's initial release (March 20) for the functionality to appear for everyone.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung's Galaxy S25 series is the first to support Instant Hotspot.</li><li>Google's Instant Hotspot feature is part of Cross-device Services, a set of features designed to make Android devices work together.</li><li>Older Samsung phones could only use the Auto Hotspot feature, exclusive to Galaxy phones and tablets.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is working on building up the Android platform into a true ecosystem of devices that work better together, including Android phones, Android tablets, and Wear OS watches. Part of that effort involves Cross-device Services, a set of Android features that help multiple devices seamlessly connect. However, the point is moot if Android manufacturers don't buy in, and historically Samsung Galaxy devices prioritize their own ecosystem features rather than the broader Google ones.</p><p>That was the case with hotspot tethering, as Samsung phones supported an Auto Hotspot feature that automatically connected with Samsung tablets. Now, starting with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 series</a>, Google's Instant Hotspot feature is supported for the first team. Leveraging Android's Cross-device Services, this means that Samsung Galaxy phones can instantly tether their hotspot to any Android tablet.</p><p>The move was first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/galaxy-s25-instant-hotspot-3537161/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, which noticed the new toggle appear in the Settings app on the Galaxy S25 series. To use it, navigate to the <strong>Cross-device Services </strong>tab in Settings, tap <strong>Internet Sharing</strong>, and make sure the <strong>Instant Hotspot </strong>toggle is flipped on. After that, Instant Hotspot will work with Android tablets and Chromebooks that are signed into the same Google account as your Galaxy S25.</p>

<p>Google's official <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/android/answer/14993633?visit_id=638775272014377898-4190878634&p=internet_sharing&rd=1" target="_blank">support document</a> for Android hotspot sharing also confirms the change. "The instant hotspot feature is available on Samsung S25 and newer devices," the document explains. "If you have an older Samsung device, you can use the auto-hotspot feature instead."</p><p>Considering that Samsung is one of the biggest Android phone manufacturers, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/androids-cross-device-services-just-became-available-for-another-brand">buying into Cross-device Services features</a> is good news for Galaxy S25 owners. It means that their smartphone will work better with any Android tablet or Chromebook, regardless of who made it.</p><p>The move could give Samsung Galaxy S25 owners more choice in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">deciding which tablet to buy</a>, as they won't need to worry about losing Instant Hotspot connection by choosing a non-Samsung tablet.</p>

<hr>
<p>A new design leak for Motorola's upcoming foldable surfaced and shows off a unique aesthetic choice.</p><p>The latest leak concerns the Motorola Razr Plus 2025 as a post by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/1902755397183635565">Evan Blass on X</a> showcased a rendering of a potential design choice for consumers (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/21/wood-backed-motorola-razr-60-ultra-surfaces-in-leaked-video/">9to5Google</a>). Curiously, all the tipster says is "Ultra" in the post, which likely refers to its international name, the Razr 60 Ultra. Meanwhile, what the rendering shows off is a wooden finish for the back of the upcoming Razr Plus. It's a lighter wood with the Motorola "M" symbol in its center and the Razr name right beneath it.</p><p>There are some uncertainties about this finish, most notably about its authenticity. From the rendering video, it's not clear if Motorola is leaning toward <em>real </em>wood or if this is a type of faux wood. As the publication also notes, the rendering shows the rear panel as glossy. That doesn't exactly scream real wood unless Motorola is giving the next Razr Plus the same polishing treatment you would give flooring in your home.</p><p>That could just be for a more interesting viewing experience or it could truly reflect the nature of the panel. The tipster also gave a few brief looks at three more color options for the Razr Plus this year.</p>

<p>If this leak is accurate, it wouldn't be the first time Motorola dropped such an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-decade-moto-x">unconventional finish</a> like wood before. Over a decade ago, the company dropped the Moto X, which provided consumers with the choice of several wood grains for its rear panel.</p><p>Since then, Motorola has provided wood backing on devices like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/news-weekly-april-20-2024#:~:text=Motorola%27s%20new%20flagship%20is%20made%20from%20wood">the Edge 50 Ultra from 2024</a>. The company dropped three phones, each with a unique set of finishes that broke the norm. Consumers could purchase them with either a wood grain back or a vegan leather finish.</p><p>There's a chance Motorola could chase a similar theme this year as a few <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/a-major-motorola-razr-plus-2025-leak-just-revealed-its-sleek-new-look">leaked Razr Plus 2025 renders</a> showcased it with a faux leather back. Aside from that, the device looked relatively similar to what we've gotten these past couple of years. It seems Motorola could continue to provide a 6.9-inch pOLED foldable display and a 4-inch cover screen. Other rumors claim the OEM could finally step up its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-plus-2025-charging-adapter-strength-database">wired charging game</a> and give the Razr Plus 2025 68W wired charging support.</p><p>More importantly, there's speculation that the foldable could <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-60-ultra-early-database-certification-spotted">launch sooner</a> this year, potentially in April.</p>

<ul><li>Epic is offering weekly free games for Android users through the Epic Games Store on mobile.</li><li>The company also added nine more titles to the Epic Games Store for Android in the last month.</li><li>Currently, users can download Super Meat Boy Forever and Eastern Exorcist for free until March 27.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Epic brought its popular PC game marketplace, the Epic Games Store, to mobile, and it's bringing the famous free games program to iOS and Android too. The company first announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/epics-free-games-program-is-coming-to-the-epic-games-store-on-android">monthly free games for the Epic Games Store</a> on mobile starting in January 2025. Now, there are weekly free games available on iOS and Android starting today, per a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/super-meat-boy-forever-eastern-exorcist-for-free-on-epic-games-store-on-mobile" target="_blank">press release</a>.</p><p>User can download Super Meat Boy Forever and Eastern Exorcist from the Epic Games Store on those platforms until March 27, free of charge. Those titles join the Epic-made free titles that are always available, like Fortnite and Rocket League. In the past, Epic offered games such as Dungeon of the Endless: Apogee, but that offer expired last month.</p><p>To install the Epic Games Store on Android, you'll need to sideload it onto your device. That means navigating to Epic's website, downloading the APK, and completing the installation process. In all, the company says it takes 12 steps for an Android user to download and run the Epic Games Store. It's a lot different than using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play-store">Google Play Store</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-turn-off-samsung-galaxy-store-notifications">Samsung Galaxy Store</a>.</p>

<p>Still, it may be worth it, especially if you like free Android games. Plus, the Epic Games Store continues to add more games and features as it builds up its game marketplace. Earlier this year, Epic added a few essential desktop features to the mobile version — persistent account login across games and auto-functionality.</p><p>Additionally, the company added nine games to the Epic Games Store for Android in the past month:</p>
<ul><li>Bowling Clash</li><li>Endling - Extinction is Forever</li><li>Chicken Police - Paint it RED</li><li>One Hand Clapping</li><li>Neighbours back From Hell</li><li>This is The Police</li><li>This is The Police 2</li><li>This Is The President</li><li>Through the Darkest of Times</li></ul>
<p>Time will tell if free games will be enough to sway Android users away from the Google Play Store, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-play-store-sucks-so-heres-what-i-use-instead">because Google's option isn't perfect</a>. For now, users can expect at least one free game each week on the Epic Games Store for Android.</p>

<ul><li>Google has reportedly started developing a new "Parallel Module Loading" change in Android that will affect the Pixel 10.</li><li>An Open Source Project post shows this "loading process" change will reduce the Pixel 10's loading time by 30%.</li><li>Previous Pixel 10 rumors mention Google's Pixie AI assistant, as well as a gallery of leaked renderings.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google was spotted making a software change that could positively impact the performance of the next flagship Pixel.</p><p>According to Mishaal Rahman (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-10-startup-performance-3537302/">Android Authority</a>), Google recently brought attention to an Android Open Source Project change tested for a couple of devices. The source code change is called "Parallel Module Loading." Aside from the technical jargon, the root of the change reads "Pixel 10 reduces 30% loading time."</p><p>Testing was also reportedly conducted on Google's Pixel Fold, in which it resulted in a 25% overall reduction.</p><p>Rahman adds that a 30% reduction in loading time will likely affect the phone's startup performance — notably its loading time. Specifically, they state this software upgrade will impact the "early part of the Android OS’s multi-stage initialization process." With a quicker process taking place, it <em>seems </em>that Google will make its next flagship models (and the Fold) load faster. However, Rahman notes that it's unclear if this change will quicken its overall startup.</p><p>Given the fact that this test showed up recently in March, there's speculation that Google could see this as a perfect addition to a future Android 16 update.</p>

<p>Rumors about the Pixel 10 are just getting started as one from earlier in March speculated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-to-debut-with-ai-powered-pixie">about a new AI assistant</a>. Internal sources claim Google will debut "Pixie," a new Pixe-exclusive assistant in the next flagship series. This AI will be popped into an app that will bring cross-communication capabilities between a user's downloaded apps. Pixie will also process a user's metadata to "predict" actions for them.</p><p>Google reportedly confirmed, "It will also be able to suggest places, products, and names, right when you need them."</p><p>Something more to chew on surfaced ten days ago: a small gallery of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-series-render-leak-reveal-identical-design">alleged Pixel 10 renderings</a>. From what a tipster highlighted, it seems Google isn't preparing to introduce a vast amount of hardware changes — if any at all — for the Pixel 10 series. The leak showcased three devices: the Pixel 10, the Pixel 10 Pro, and the Pixel 10 Pro XL. The trio's images sported the exact same design with rounded corners and flat edges as the Pixel 19 series we have today.</p><p>However, one major assumption is that the base Pixel 10 could grab an additional lens, taking it up from a dual array to a triple.</p>

<p>I'm what some would call a "specs snob." Meaning that I want the latest, greatest, and most powerful device that I can get my hands on. After years of reviewing phones and devices that nobody should use but everyone bought, I (mostly) decided that enough was enough. It also doesn't help that around the time I made that personal decision, I got my hands on the Galaxy Z Fold 2.</p><p>So when I saw that Google announced the Pixel 9a, I just read the headlines and just kept it moving. It wasn't until I read the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-hands-on">excellent hands-on</a> from Android Central's very own Michael Hicks that I started to look a bit deeper into what the 9a had to offer.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="X4LoRMCV4CBHh7tFn2xGiA" name="Google-Pixel-9a-vs-8a-cameras" alt="The Iris Google Pixel 9a (left) and Bay Google Pixel 8a (right), the 8a slightly overlapping the 9a corner. The photo focuses on the 9a's new camera cutout compared to the 8a's camera bar." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/X4LoRMCV4CBHh7tFn2xGiA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To get this out of the way, I don't like Google's decision to remove the camera bar. It's been a staple of the Pixel lineup since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-6">Pixel 6</a>, and while I haven't said this out loud, I was also disappointed when it was removed from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>. Now, colors notwithstanding, the Pixel 9a just blends in with the sea of rectangles that everyone uses.</p><p>Anyways, on paper, the Pixel 9a is practically the perfect phone for the majority of people. Do you need an all-day battery life? The 9a delivers a 5,100mAh battery, paired with a larger vapor chamber for better cooling, which, in turn, should mean the Tensor G4 has a bit more room to breathe. Oh, and by the way, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/why-google-pixel-9a-ditched-camera-bar">Google claims</a> these two changes are the reasons why the camera bar was sliced off.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eK5yWTTFGhV2NNhMAeyEB8" name="google-tensor-g4-pixel-9-pro-xl-1.jpg" alt="Google Tensor G4 on Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eK5yWTTFGhV2NNhMAeyEB8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Speaking of performance, the Tensor G4 is in the cockpit, with 8GB of LPDDR5X riding shotgun. That sounds great, right? Actually, yeah, I think it sounds pretty darn good. What's that? You don't get Pixel Screenshots or Call Notes? Oh well.</p><p>Apparently, this is because Google is using an "extra extra small" Gemini Nano model. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/meager-8gb-of-ram-forces-pixel-9a-to-run-extra-extra-small-gemini-ai/">Ars Technica</a>, Google confirmed that this model has other limitations, such as "the lack of multimodality—Gemini Nano 1.0 XXS is <em>text-only</em>."</p><p>Normally, I would put on my Jerry hat and be irritated that Google didn't figure out a way to include features that should be staples across the entire lineup. So why am I sitting here feeling the complete opposite?</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="SuHipTSvRxGqb5ycFmBX9g" name="pixel-9-ai.jpg" alt="Pixel Screenshots on the Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SuHipTSvRxGqb5ycFmBX9g.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Because this is the exact problem that Google needed to solve.</p><p>Flashback to last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a> release, and you would have a hard time convincing me that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> was actually the better phone. With the exception of the camera hardware and camera features, the Pixel 8a offered practically the same experience while costing $200 less.</p><p>With the Pixel 9a, there are quite a few differences, but Google managed to drop the less important features while providing some sound reasoning as to why.</p>

<p>The Pixel 9a still lets you enjoy the fruits of Gemini's labor, but it just might not be as fast and can't handle anything other than text. It's not equipped with the best camera that Google offers, but the 48MP main lens still sounds pretty darn good, and you aren't losing out on Google's image processing.</p><p>Sure, it has a larger screen and bigger battery than its brethren, but the camera bar is gone, and the bezels are massive. On top of that, the Pixel 9 features an ultrasonic fingerprint reader, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/why-ultrasonic-fingerprint-sensors-just-dont-work-for-me">some would argue</a> that an optical sensor is better anyway. Personally, I just think Google needs to embed it in the power button, but what do I know?</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CcMYegdn3J5Sf9ybyfyWrR" name="Google-Pixel-9-review-14.jpg" alt="The Pixel 9 fingerprint sensor" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CcMYegdn3J5Sf9ybyfyWrR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>So, instead of getting 95% of what the more expensive version has, you get something closer to 85% or maybe 90%. All while paying $200 less and coming in a dollar short of the $500 imaginary line in the sand.</p><p>But what about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-vs-iphone-16e">iPhone 16e</a>? Yeah? What about it? Apple might have beaten both Google and Samsung to the punch with a new mid-range phone, but the iPhone 16e also costs $100 more and falls short in a lot of ways.</p><p>If you don't believe me, just check this out:</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">So, today Google launched the Pixel 9a, and it continues to show how much of an embarrassment the iPhone 16e is.Here’s everything the Pixel 9a has over the iPhone 16e, despite being $100 cheaper:– Blue and pink color choices– 6.3” display vs 6.1”– 120 Hz vs 60 Hz– 2,700… pic.twitter.com/Vj75GqF1JV<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1902396486018580494">March 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Which reminds me, if you're feeling sour or betrayed by Google leaving out some Gemini features, just remember that Siri <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/1jehkpm/apple_intelligence_this_apple_intelligence_that/">can't even tell you what month it is</a>. No, I'm not kidding.</p><p>For years, if someone asked me to recommend the best phone for $500, I'd probably have told them to either wait for a deal or just get an iPhone. Even if that meant getting the last-gen iPhone SE, which still had the physical home button. That's no longer the case, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-needs-google-now-more-than-ever">Apple continues to stumble</a> and fall harder and harder while Google keeps mosying on along. As such, if you asked me that same question today, I'd tell you to quit talking to me and pre-order one already.</p><p>There's just something about the Pixel 9a that feels comfortable, and that's coming from someone who hasn't actually used one yet. Not only that, but the Pixel 9a might be the first Android phone that I would feel good about giving to an older family member. The peace of mind of being able to hand someone a phone and absolve yourself from being the dedicated tech support rep makes the Pixel 9a worth every penny and probably more.</p>

<ul><li>A report "confirms" the Google Pixel 9a features a "limited" version of AI called Gemini Nano XXS.</li><li>The Pixel 9a only features 8GB of RAM, which isn't enough to support the bulk of Google's larger, fancier AI features, thus the even smaller version of Gemini.</li><li>During its launch, Google said the Pixel 9a supports Gemini Live, Best Take, Add Me, Magic Editor, and more.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google's latest Pixel is more affordable and, according to recent reports, it features a less powerful version of the company's AI, too.</p><p>A report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/meager-8gb-of-ram-forces-pixel-9a-to-run-extra-extra-small-gemini-ai/">Ars Technica</a> confirms Google's Pixel 9a runs a much smaller, less resource-chasing version of its AI called "Gemini Nano XXS" (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/pixel-9a-gemini-not-powerful-rest-of-pixel-9-series/">Android Police</a>). The publication states this "limited" version of Gemini Nano takes center stage because of the Pixel 9a's low amount of available RAM: only 8GB. As a result, research shows the Pixel 9a doesn't contain <em>all </em>of the AI features Pixel consumers might've become accustomed to/seen with the recent Pixel 9 series.</p><p>The post says the device doesn't sport features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-call-notes-google-pixel">Call Notes</a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-the-pixel-screenshots-app-on-the-google-pixel-9">Pixel Screenshots app</a>. Additionally, it notes "Google doesn't call out missing features on the product page," meaning more testing is required to know the full extent of the missing Gemini features the Pixel 9a lacks.</p><p>These two prominent features are missing from the Pixel 9a because of the audio and video processing functions required. The publication says Gemini Nano XXS simply can't do what's required to run these two AI features, so they've been left out.</p><p>The Pixel 9a still has some useful AI features like Recorder app text summaries. Due to its low available RAM (a resource heavily sought after for on-device AI), the Gemini Nano XXS model is said to "only load when the model is needed." As a result, users may notice some other functions become a little less reliable when calling on Gemini for AI assistance. If the model ran continuously in the background users likely wouldn't have the capability of doing much — at least not well.</p>

<p>Speaking of its supported AI features, when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/pixel-9a-arrives-with-a-fresh-new-look">the Pixel 9a launched</a> earlier this week, Google highlighted a few of them. The company stated the device contains features like Gemini Live, Best Take, Add Me, Magic Editor, "and more." Considering the last three choices, these all revolve around photography. If Gemini Nano XXS only surfaces "when needed," those features would fit the bill.</p><p>A few other features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> and Call Assist were also mentioned.</p><p>Google likely had to make some changes to ensure the Pixel 9a would remain in the "budget realm," kind of like its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-past-gen-exynos-modem-confirmation">past-gen modem</a>. The company recently confirmed that the Pixel 9a utilizes the older Exynos 5300 modem, which lacks satellite connectivity support. Moreover, the modem is overall less powerful compared to the newer Exynos 5400 inside the other Pixel 9 series phones (with satellite connectivity).</p><p>There's some additional concern about this choice considering, in 2023, the Exynos 5300 was popped into the Pixel 8 series, which gave users quite the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-and-8-pro-battery-drain-and-network-issues">mobile data headache</a>. Not only was their reception questionable, but the modem seemingly affected the series' battery as users saw severe draining issues.</p>

The aluminum design, page turn buttons, and high-quality E Ink panel made it a standout choice, but annoyingly, Amazon doesn't sell the product any longer, and there isn't a viable alternative — the brand is instead focusing on note-taking devices like the Scribe. <br><br>This was problematic as the battery life of my Kindle Oasis isn't anywhere close to what it used to be; I still get a few days out of a charge, but I couldn't reliably use it on the road. As I started heading back to events, I wanted another e-reader that was up to the task, and that's where I came across the Kobo Libra Colour. <br><br>Kobo's latest e-reader nails the basics; it has a 7-inch E Ink panel, adjustable warm light, and physical page turn buttons — all the features that made me like the Kindle Oasis. As a bonus, the e-reader has USB-C connectivity, and Libby/Overdrive integration. <br><br>I switched to the Libra Colour at the start of the year, and after three months of extensive use involving travel to three countries and reading over a dozen books, I'm convinced — this is the ideal upgrade to the Kindle Oasis.</p>

It <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Kobo-Glare-Free-KaleidoTM-Audiobooks-Waterproof/dp/B0CZXX465Z">costs $229 on Amazon</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://us.kobobooks.com/products/kobo-libra-colour">Rakuten store</a>, and you can get your hands on the e-reader <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Kobo-Glare-Free-KaleidoTM-Audiobooks-Waterproof-White/dp/B0CZXWGK79">in the U.K. for £209</a>. It debuted in India back in October 2024, and is available in the country for ₹19,999 ($231).</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="SjhLeqJMWEojMaHSgzToiS" name="Kobo Libra Colour" alt="Kobo Libra Colour review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SjhLeqJMWEojMaHSgzToiS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Kobo did a good job with the design of the Libra Colour, and it feels great to hold and use. Just like the Kindle Oasis, the Libra Colour has physical page turn buttons, but they're on the left. There's a raised edge on the left that makes it easier to hold the e-reader, and the back is flat.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kw3tUjtTPKmdphK964o8KT" name="Kobo Libra Colour" alt="Kobo Libra Colour review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kw3tUjtTPKmdphK964o8KT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unlike the Oasis, the Libra Colour has a plastic back, and while it doesn't quite have the same premium feel, there are no issues with the build quality. Coming in at 199g, the Libra Colour is 11g heavier than the Oasis, but the difference isn't noticeable in daily use. And while it has a plastic back, there is an interesting floral motif at the back that makes holding the device just that little easier.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GJMHYpiCbsm85vF74hhGBT" name="Kobo Libra Colour" alt="Kobo Libra Colour review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GJMHYpiCbsm85vF74hhGBT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The raised edge houses the USB-C port, and it's great to be able to use an e-reader that uses the same charging port as my phone. This was a constant source of frustration with the Kindle Oasis, and Amazon really should have introduced a model with USB-C connectivity. Thankfully, that isn't an issue on the Libra Colour.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wWv7T3LWRJY7AezX7cUxCT" name="Kobo Libra Colour" alt="Kobo Libra Colour review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wWv7T3LWRJY7AezX7cUxCT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I got the white color variant of the e-reader, and it looks a little more distinctive than the standard black model. The e-reader has built-in sensors that change the orientation of the screen according to whatever hand you're holding it in, and the location of the page turn buttons is ideal.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="43crX43JatRGpTr3We3EeS" name="Kobo Libra Colour" alt="Kobo Libra Colour review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/43crX43JatRGpTr3We3EeS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The buttons are easily accessible with your thumb, and have good tactility. If anything, the buttons proved to be a bit too stiff in the beginning, but they're better to use now. Having physical buttons makes all the difference on an e-reader, and I can't go back to using one without it. A cool feature is the ability to invert the buttons; by default, the bottom button is used to go to the next page in a book, but you can easily switch it to the top button.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="YGTostjKV9P5F8c3U5JVjS" name="Kobo Libra Colour" alt="Kobo Libra Colour review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YGTostjKV9P5F8c3U5JVjS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The one issue I have with the design is the power button; it's located at the back, and it's inconvenient to access most of the time. Thankfully, pressing the page turn buttons wakes the device, so that's what I've been doing. While it isn't a problem as such, I don't like that the panel doesn't sit flush with the body; this is another area where the Oasis wins out. <br><br>Outside of that though, I can't find anything to fault with the Libra Colour. It may not have quite the same in-hand feel as the Oasis, but it is just as reliable in daily use, and it holds up incredibly well during travel.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-kobo-libra-colour-panel"><span>Kobo Libra Colour: Panel</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LAho9TjLddxcPeRnyFybjS" name="Kobo Libra Colour" alt="Kobo Libra Colour review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LAho9TjLddxcPeRnyFybjS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The defining feature on the Libra Colour is the 7-inch panel, and unlike every other e-reader I used until now, it does a great job rendering colors. It's made possible by use of E Ink's Kaleido 3 panel, and it has good color saturation thanks to 4,096 colors. The resolution of the panel is 1680 x 1264, with a pixel density of 300PPI — just like the Kindle Oasis — with monochrome text and 140PPI when it comes to content in color.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="YVgBf8CWQ4jmBeNn9BPMiS" name="Kobo Libra Colour" alt="Kobo Libra Colour review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YVgBf8CWQ4jmBeNn9BPMiS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's enjoyable to use an e-reader with a color panel, and it's a technical achievement in and of itself. Because of the way E Ink panels work, there's no backlight powering the display, and it's instead illuminated by LEDs on the side. While this isn't an issue with black and white text — it looks just as clean as other e-readers — it is noticeable when viewing things like comics and book covers.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="uDgzsS9TxMn2d3JNPGG7JT" name="Kobo Libra Colour" alt="Kobo Libra Colour review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uDgzsS9TxMn2d3JNPGG7JT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's a noticeable grain to the colors, and because of the inherent nature of E Ink, you don't get the same color vibrancy as LCD or OLED panels — that's just the way the tech works. So if you're looking to get the Libra Colour to read comics, know that it still does a decent job in this area as it integrates the CBZ and CBR extensions, but color quality won't be anywhere as good as an Android tablet like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/xiaomi-pad-7-is-a-convincing-ipad-air-clone-that-costs-half-as-much">Xiaomi Pad 7</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="hPNFKNLTXDPWAgAViBPGiS" name="Kobo Libra Colour" alt="Kobo Libra Colour review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hPNFKNLTXDPWAgAViBPGiS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The E Ink panel by itself does a good job curbing blue light emissions, and I had no problems using the Libra Colour all day. It uses Kobo's ComfortLight Pro tech, so you get adjustable warm light in addition to the regular white LED lighting, and it definitely makes a difference — particularly when reading at night. On that note, there's dark mode as well, and while I use the mode extensively on my monitor and phones, I prefer reading books without it. <br><br>Basically, this is one of the best panels you can get today, and it makes using the Libra Colour that much more engaging.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-kobo-libra-colour-real-world-usage"><span>Kobo Libra Colour: Real-world usage</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="gFDkdD6J4bfRwj6uqSJHDT" name="Kobo Libra Colour" alt="Kobo Libra Colour review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gFDkdD6J4bfRwj6uqSJHDT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Libra Colour is a delight to use; it's comfortable to hold throughout the day, and the 7-inch panel size is ideal to read books. The E Ink panel itself is terrific, with good pixel density and clarity. I didn't see any issues with ghosting — where afterimages of previous pages are retained when you refresh — and the interface is just as fluid as the Kindle Oasis.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Ga7uUAJjzBFmGSgMUkwemS" name="Kobo Libra Colour" alt="Kobo Libra Colour review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ga7uUAJjzBFmGSgMUkwemS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are no issues with navigation, and page turns are handled smoothly while reading a book. Obviously, a big draw is the physical page turn buttons, and they make using the Libra Colour that much more enjoyable. While I didn't use it to read comics, it's fun to be able to view book covers in color, and that novelty doesn't go away. What I also like is that the device lets you put the cover on the lock screen when it's idling, and that's a nice addition.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="eMs2oKfTHUxhBwJjRZ9aET" name="Kobo Libra Colour" alt="Kobo Libra Colour review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eMs2oKfTHUxhBwJjRZ9aET.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Libra Colour is available in a single configuration with 32GB of storage, and considering most ebooks are less than 1MB in size, the storage isn't a problem with sizable collections. It isn't an issue even if you want to read comics on the device, and while the color panel doesn't have the best resolution, it is a decent choice in this regard. Similarly, you can listen to audiobooks by connecting a Bluetooth device.</p>
<p>The e-reader has a 2050mAh battery, and in my usage, it easily lasted two weeks between charges. That's less than what I got with the Kindle Oasis (back when it's battery didn't degrade), but the color E Ink panel needs more power, and the convenience of charging over USB-C more than offsets any issues around battery longevity. Charging the e-reader takes over an hour and a half as it is limited to 10W, and it didn't exceed 7W when connected to a standard 100W USB PD charger.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="DFXFU47gWmiuXquUfkKRgS" name="Kobo Libra Colour" alt="Kobo Libra Colour review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DFXFU47gWmiuXquUfkKRgS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What I like about the software is the customizability. There's integration with cloud storage providers, so you can easily download books from Google Drive if that's what you prefer. You can also easily load custom fonts on the device, and the built-in selection in itself is extensive. I've gotten used to Amazon's Bookerly font over the last decade, and it was a breeze to install it on the e-reader. <br><br>You can also easily annotate and highlight books, and this is particularly handy thanks to the color E Ink panel. There's also the ability to journal and take notes, but you'll need to pick up the Kobo Stylus to do that. I have a dozen styli in the house, but none of those — even the ones paired with Onyx and Remarkable readers — connected to the Libra Colour, so I wasn't able to test this feature.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6rw5Y5WcaWTMbhX7yPHMAT" name="Kobo Libra Colour" alt="Kobo Libra Colour review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6rw5Y5WcaWTMbhX7yPHMAT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's IPX8 ingress protection, and you can use the Libra Colour in the tub or at the pool without any issues. Finally, if you use Libby, you can get the books onto the Libra Colour and read without too much of a hassle, and that's another area where the e-reader wins out against the Kindle Oasis. <br><br>In general, the Libra Colour does a better job with DRM-free e-books than any of Amazon's e-readers, and it's refreshing to see. Kobo's ebook store isn't anywhere as extensive as the Kindle Store, but you can easily grab books from any storefront and read on the Libra Colour as it has native EPUB, EPUB3, FlePub, PDF, and MOBI integration.</p>

<p>As good as the Kindle Oasis has been, it's clear that Amazon has no intention of delivering a successor to the product. Thankfully, there are other alternatives around; I like what Onyx is doing with its e-readers, and the BOOX Go Color 7 is a decent choice. <br><br>It has the same E Ink Kaleido 3 panel as the Libra Colour, adjustable warm light, and higher 64GB of storage. You get physical page turn buttons as well, and although I didn't test the product, I'm keen on seeing whether Onyx was able to resolve the ghosting issues that's prevalent on its other devices.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You want an e-reader with a color panel</li><li>You want physical page turning buttons</li><li>You need a good design that's built to last</li><li>You want great battery life</li><li>You need customization-friendly software</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You need an extensive built-in ebook store</li><li>You want a metallic chassis</li></ul>
<p>The Libra Colour delivers everything I need in an e-reader in 2025. The design isn't too heavy, and the white model looks quite elegant. Kobo did a great job with the weight distribution, and I didn't see any issues even after using the e-reader all day. The page turn buttons take a while to get used to as they're stiff out of the box, but once you've gotten acclimated to the e-reader, this isn't an issue. <br><br>The E Ink panel is delightful; text is clear and detailed with no ghosting, and there's extensive customizability when it comes to font selection. The icing on the cake is the color panel, and it's fun to view book covers and illustrations as intended. The warm light makes it easier to use the e-reader at night, and with Bluetooth, USB-C connectivity, and IPX8 ingress protection, Kobo nailed the basics. <br><br>The software is great to use, and there's no lag when navigating the interface or turning pages in a book. Battery life isn't quite as good as the Kindle Oasis, but you'll still only need to charge the device biweekly on average. Ultimately, the Libra Colour is the best e-reader to upgrade to if you're still on the Kindle Oasis.</p>

<p>The SwitchBot Wallet Finder Card made its debut at IFA 2024. Initially, I had dismissed it as your everyday run-of-the-mill Bluetooth tracker. Don't make the same mistake I made at first because there's more to this wallet-finding tracker.</p><p>SwitchBot is a brand dedicated to smartening up the dumb things in your home and integrating them all together to create a cohesive ecosystem. I have used many of the brand's smart home accessories over the years and they never disappoint, both in terms of quality and price.</p><p>The company makes everything IoT, from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-locks">smart locks</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/switchbot-hub-2-review">hubs</a> to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/switchbot-universal-remote">universal remotes</a> and hygrometers. Once you set up your smart home system via the SwitchBot app and every item can communicate with each other, that's when the magic happens.</p><p>Here's how well the amicably priced SwitchBot Wallet Finder Card held up in my testing.</p>

<h2 id="not-your-average-bluetooth-tracker-2">Not your average Bluetooth tracker</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3222px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="DysMiyDqgUzXd26PMtShCD" name="SwitchBot Wallet Finder Card" alt="SwitchBot Wallet Finder Card" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DysMiyDqgUzXd26PMtShCD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3222" height="1812" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are plenty of unique aspects of the slim and trim SwitchBot Wallet Finder Card. But first, let's evaluate its functionality as a regular old <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-trackers">Bluetooth tracker</a>, as this is its primary purpose.</p><p>Like any Bluetooth tracking device worth its salt, the Wallet Finder Card can be tracked via an app on your phone. There's no <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/testing-new-google-find-my-device-trackers">Google Find My Device</a> support, so for now, you can only use Apple's Find My network on iOS. Android users can still use the tracker using the SwitchBot app for Android.</p><p>You can save the Wallet Finder Card under the name of your choice within the app, which is also where you can track the card. You can also use the card to find your phone by clicking the button twice. It has a physical QR code sticker on the back as a failsafe when it gets lost. Anyone can scan it and alert you of its location. SwitchBot also has anti-tracking measures in place for the safety of the public.</p>

<p>The speaker on the tracker rings nice and loud at 78dB, much like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/tile-bluetooth-trackers-review">Tile Slim that I reviewed</a> a while back. Notably, the newer Tile Slim has a louder 104dB volume. Just like the best Tile trackers, you get robust IP67 water and dust-proofing on the SwitchBot Wallet Finder Card. When I put the two cards next to each other, the SwitchBot one was noticeably lighter and thinner.</p><p>Compared to the latest Tile by Life360 Slim (2024)'s 350ft range, the Switchbot tracker's 300ft Bluetooth range is still not bad at all. Considering the previous-gen Tile Slim had a 250ft range, and this is SwitchBot's first tracker, that's impressive.</p><p>Finally, there's no replaceable battery on the Wallet Finder Card, but you get three years of battery life. As a Bluetooth tracker alone, it's an excellent product that delivers value for money.</p>
<h2 id="a-more-integrated-smart-home-than-ever-before-2">A more integrated smart home than ever before</h2>

<p>On to the unconventional aspects. The SwitchBot Wallet Finder Card has two very unusual features. The first is that it has NFC support.</p><p>Why would you even need NFC on a Bluetooth tracker? Well, SwitchBot added a nifty integration with its smart locks, so you can tap the Wallet Finder Card on a SwitchBot Lock and use it to unlock your door.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4320px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.00%;"><img id="H9cG7Qomx4GRRvSm6jSeMD" name="SwitchBot Wallet Finder Card" alt="SwitchBot Wallet Finder Card" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/H9cG7Qomx4GRRvSm6jSeMD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4320" height="2376" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The second unique and most enticing feature of the SwitchBot Wallet Finder Card is smart home integration. There are two main automations that are specific to the tracking card within the SwitchBot app: Return Home and Leave Home.</p><p>For example, you could set an automation where as soon as your Wallet Finder Card enters within range of the hub at home, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/best-smart-home-devices">smart home devices</a> like air conditioner and lights in your house turn on.</p><p>This option requires you to have a SwitchBot hub, but the final result is well worth the extra buy. Since the SwitchBot hub comes with an IR blaster built-in, you can "teach" it to learn commands to operate non-smart devices in your home as well. This, along with your Wallet Finder Card, can be used to make incredibly intelligent routines within the SwitchBot app.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The sky's the limit with these smart home automations.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>And if you get the Matter-enabled Hub 2, it gets even better. You could interconnect devices that support Alexa, Samsung SmartThings, Google Assistant, and other smart home ecosystems to create a single unified smart home setup.</p><p>Since the Hub 2 can interact with smart and dumb electronics via IR, the possibilities are limitless. You could pre-soak a one-pot rice dish in your smart cooker and integrate that into your Return Home routine. If you have the SwitchBot Curtain Opener, you could instruct your Leave Home automations to close the curtains and turn off all electronics at home.</p><p>The sky's the limit with these automations; you really have access to boundless potential with the right mix of smart and dumb electronics at home.</p><p>Despite all that, the SwitchBot Wallet Finder Card only costs $24.99, with frequent sales slashing that price to an even lower $19.99 price tag. It's a great buy overall, even if you don't end up using the smart home integration as much.</p>

Enter the Google Pixel 8a.</p><p>While <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a">the Pixel 9a</a> will soon be the budget Android champ, the 8a continues to be a compelling option for anyone seeking a great Android experience without spending too much money.</p><p>I'm not talking about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/should-you-upgrade-to-the-pixel-9a">whether or not you should upgrade</a>. I'm saying that if I needed a new phone, I'd buy a Pixel 8a as soon as the price drops with the release of the 9a.</p>

<h2 id="software-support-keeps-the-pixel-8a-like-new-2">Software support keeps the Pixel 8a like new</h2>
<p>One of the most significant selling points of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-vs-pixel-8a">Pixel 8a</a> was its long-term software support, and that's what makes it the phone I would buy today. Google has pledged a remarkable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-many-updates-will-the-pixel-8a-receive">seven years of OS and security updates</a> for the 8a, mirroring the flagship Pixel 8 series. This means your device will remain secure and up-to-date with the latest Android features well <strong>into the 2030s</strong>.</p>

<p>This changes things. In the past, buying an older model of Android meant you would probably see the manufacturer drop support for it before you were ready to stop using it. Seven years means you'll be using something else before Google says goodbye to the Pixel 8a.</p><p>In a market where many mid-range phones receive only a couple of years of support, this extended lifespan is a major advantage. It ensures your investment is protected, and you won't be forced to upgrade prematurely due to software obsolescence.</p><p>This extended support isn't just about security patches, but it doesn't mean the 8a will be updated to do <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/7-years-of-updates-arent-what-you-think-they-are-and-samsung-just-proved-it">nearly everything Google dreams up in the future</a>. The Pixel series is renowned for its AI-powered capabilities, from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-editor-on-the-pixel-8">Magic Editor</a> for photos to the Call Assist features that make communication smoother.</p><p>With seven years of updates, the Pixel 8a will see some feature improvements here and there, but you shouldn't count on anything new. You can, however, know that the phone's software should work as well or better at the end of seven years as it did on day one. That's a big deal.</p>

<p>Beyond the software, the Pixel 8a boasts impressive hardware for the price. The Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-tensor-g3-best-phone-chip-today">Tensor G3 chip</a>, <em>mostly</em> the same processor found in the flagship Pixel 8 and 8 Pro, enables decent performance, fast app loading, and exceptional AI processing. The 8a handles everything I want a phone to do with ease.</p><p>The camera system is another highlight. The Pixel series has consistently delivered outstanding photography, and the 8a is no exception. Its dual rear camera setup isn't anything particularly special, but Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/computational-photography">computational photography</a> prowess shines through, producing stunning images with accurate colors, excellent dynamic range, and impressive low-light performance.</p><p>Features like Magic Eraser and Photo Unblur further enhance the photography experience, allowing you to easily edit and improve your photos.</p><p>The Pixel 8a also features a great display. The OLED panel delivers rich colors and deep blacks, while the 120Hz refresh rate ensures fluid scrolling and animations. The device's compact size and comfortable design make it easy to hold and use, even for extended periods.</p>

<p>Now, let's address the elephant in the room: the Pixel 9a. As with any new smartphone release, the arrival of the 9a will likely lead to a price drop for the Pixel 8a. This makes it an even more attractive option for budget-conscious buyers. The 8a already offers excellent value at its current price, but a further reduction would make it an absolute steal.</p><p>Everything you've read and heard about the 8a still stands. It's still the same phone it was in 2024, and it will stay that way for seven years. The Google Pixel 8a is far from being outdated. Its long-term software support, capable hardware, excellent camera, and potential price drop make it a compelling choice for anyone looking for a reliable and feature-rich smartphone without breaking the bank.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Google Home and Nest speakers and displays as we know them may be doomed if the company's recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a> deprecations are any indication. Google Assistant is rapidly losing features as Google puts more time and effort into Gemini, its AI-based chatbot and assistant. Just this week, Google announced plans to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-is-dialing-back-more-assistant-features-on-android-and-nest-devices">remove seven more features from Google Assistant</a> in the future, following up the 18 features that were lost in early 2024.</p><p>As such, it's not an understatement to call the Google Assistant a shell of its former self. That isn't as much of an issue on smartphones and tablets, as Gemini serves as a better virtual assistant in many cases. When Gemini falls short, Android phones and tablets can take advantage of Assistant extensions to fill the gap. In fact, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/gemini-on-wear-os-will-be-much-needed-but-tricky-upgrade-for-assistant">rumors point to Gemini replacing the Google Assistant on smartwatches</a> via a future Wear OS update, too.</p><p>There's just one problem — Gemini can't replace the Google Assistant on the smart home devices that need it most. Google hasn't refreshed its smart displays, including the second-generation Nest Hub and the Nest Hub Max, since 2021. It hasn't updated the Google Nest Mini smart speaker since 2019. That reality means that the affordable and aging Nest smart speakers and displays could be left without critical Assistant features <em>and</em> unable to run Gemini effectively.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zCJAyKaEZHWppcZcezhaFM" name="google-tv-streamer-with-nest-cam-hands-on.jpg" alt="Google TV Streamer with Nest Cam" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zCJAyKaEZHWppcZcezhaFM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google quietly set a precedent for how it plans to get Gemini on smart home products last year, and it's bad news for fans of Nest hardware. The company completely killed the affordable Chromecast lineup in favor of the $100 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv-streamer-review">Google TV Streamer</a>, which will soon <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv-survey-previews-how-gemini-live-is-coming-to-the-big-screens">get Gemini Live and other AI features</a>.</p><p>With Google seemingly winding down Assistant and putting a greater focus on Gemini, I'm worried that the Nest lineup could share a similar fate. The company could shift toward more expensive (and powerful) smart home controllers, like the Pixel Tablet, which can better handle Gemini. That would be a mistake because Google Assistant is the perfect piece of software to run on affordable and lightweight smart home products.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="aiSriPvXUhzR8ndHkNREWL" name="google-nest-hub-2nd-gen-photo-library.jpg" alt="Google Nest Hub (2nd Gen) photo library" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aiSriPvXUhzR8ndHkNREWL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1151" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Due to the age of Google Nest speakers and displays, they're starting to slow down, and features are beginning not to work as expected. In some instances, the platform has felt like an afterthought. Earlier this year, a bug <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/google-resolves-issue-causing-nest-speakers-displays-to-fail-answering-basic-requests" target="_blank">caused Nest devices to fail to answer basic requests</a>, and it took weeks for users to get a fix.</p><p>On top of that, Google is actively <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-assistant-to-lose-some-set-of-features">killing key Google Assistant features</a>. Aside from the 18 features axed last year, the company recently updated its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/assistant/answer/13971691?hl=en#zippy=%2Cassistant-changes" target="_blank">support document</a> with seven new deprecations. For instance, you won't be able to change photo frame settings or ambient screen settings with your voice anymore. While you can still do this manually on your Nest display, that kind of defeats the point of having a voice-equipped smart screen.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="mDW3Lj2XFWRt7LUWkSEosA" name="google-nest-mini-lifestyle-16x9-01.jpg" alt="Nest Mini" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mDW3Lj2XFWRt7LUWkSEosA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Some of the more egregious removals include the ability to get daily updates from your Google Assistant, such as requests like "Send me the weather every day." You also won't be able to favorite, share, or use your voice to ask about photos that were taken. Put simply, Nest hardware doesn't just lack new features — it's also consistently losing basic functionality and features.</p><p>It's understandable that Google doesn't want to spread itself too thin by working on Assistant and Gemini simultaneously, but it should consider all of the products in its portfolio. While Pixel phones and tablets are getting better by the day with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">new Gemini features</a>, Nest speakers and displays are seemingly getting worse by the day.</p><p>Android Central reached out to Google regarding its plans for current and future Nest devices, as well as the state of Google Assistant, but the company did not get back to us in time for publication.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5472px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bi7MhZGQa4eW7r5ZWBEvcF" name="google-pixel-tablet-nest-hub-max.jpg" alt="Nest Hub Max next to Pixel Tablet on countertop" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bi7MhZGQa4eW7r5ZWBEvcF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5472" height="3078" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If the option to switch to Gemini was available today for Nest hardware, Google's recent Assistant feature removals would be defensible. However, it isn't, and I'm skeptical that Gemini is the solution to this problem. It's unlikely that a Gemini-based assistant could run on older Nest speakers and displays, leaving them stuck with a Google Assistant bleeding basic features.</p><p>The transition to Gemini might kill Nest smart home products as we know them. Existing hardware would almost certainly become less useful, as the Google Assistant has lost 25 features since the start of 2024. New hardware, if released, would probably be priced higher than current Nest speakers and displays to accommodate AI processing demands.</p><p>Historically, the great thing about the Google Nest family of products was that you could outfit your entire home with speakers, cameras, and displays without breaking the bank. A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nest-mini-review">Nest Mini</a> speaker costs $50 at retail, and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nest-hub-2nd-gen-review">Nest Hub</a> display costs $100 at retail.</p>

<p>Google needs to upgrade Nest smart speakers and displays, like it upgraded the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/the-new-nest-thermostat-has-a-better-display-and-you-can-personalize-its-home-screen">Nest Learning Thermostat</a> and created the Google TV Streamer. Many of the devices in the Nest lineup are half a decade old, or older.</p><p>With that being said, it should be careful about creating new Nest speakers and displays that are more premium, more powerful, and more pricey.  If the future of Nest hardware is Gemini-powered products sold at a premium price, the brand's identity would be drastically changed.</p>

<ul><li>Xfinity and Spectrum Mobile are planning to give their customers satellite messaging on select Android phones "in the coming weeks."</li><li>At launch, only the Samsung Galaxy S25 and the Google Pixel 9 lineups are supported.</li><li>The move follows Verizon's introduction of satellite messaging on those same devices yesterday, in an industry first.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Samsung Galaxy S25</a> and the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9"> Google Pixel 9</a> series support satellite connectivity, and major U.S. cellular carriers are gearing up to offer free satellite messaging for users of those models. Xfinity Mobile and Spectrum are both planning to offer satellite texting for customers "in the coming weeks" with a Galaxy S25 or Pixel 9. The move comes just one day after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/verizon-wireless/verizon-satellite-texting-us-customers-first-select-phones">Verizon became the first carrier to offer the service</a>.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://corporate.comcast.com/press/releases/charter-and-comcast-launch-satellite-connectivity-for-mobile-devices" target="_blank">announcement</a> reveals that Charter Communications and Comcast, which operate Xfinity and Spectrum Mobile respectively, are partnering with Skylo to deliver satellite messaging. The new functionality will give customers the "ability to send and receive SMS text messages over satellite service" and is "expected to be added in the coming weeks," per the company.</p><p>For now, satellite messaging appears to be limited to the Galaxy S25 lineup and the Pixel 9 series. Verizon's offering only applies to those models, and the same goes for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/samsung-expands-comcast-5g-xfinity-mobile">Xfinity Mobile</a> and Spectrum's planned service.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3958px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="Ce4YyBPCnC7DLSyM5wmBuE" name="Google-Pixel-9-satellite-sos-outdoors" alt="Holding the Google Pixel 9 with a Satellite SOS demo active" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ce4YyBPCnC7DLSyM5wmBuE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3958" height="2226" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The satellite messaging capabilities that will soon be offered by Spectrum and Xfinity Mobile will allow customers to text any number when Wi-Fi and cellular is unavailable using overhead satellites. This is in addition to the existing "Satellite SOS" feature offered by Google, which is only available in an emergency.</p><p>Spectrum and Xfinity Mobile aren't offering satellite messaging for iPhone users, but they might not need it as much as Android users. Starting with iOS 18, Apple offers free satellite messaging for users with an iPhone 14 or newer. Even though Samsung and Google sell phones capable of satellite connectivity, they've opted to leave it up to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cell-phone-plans">cellular carriers</a> to provide the feature with their own non-terrestrial network (NTN) service providers.</p><p>"The availability of satellite backup service provides Spectrum Mobile customers with a sense of security, knowing they can stay connected even in the most remote locations," said Danny Bowman, who is the executive vice president of product at Charter Communications, in a press release.</p>

<ul><li>Gmail is rolling out a new, upgraded version of mail search that can prioritize "most relevant" results.</li><li>Users can still manually sort "most recent" results to get the list in chronological order.</li><li>The feature is rolling out now for personal Google accounts, and will eventually come to business accounts in the future.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is upgrading Gmail's search smarts with AI to prioritize relevant results over recent keyword hits, it announced in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/gmail/gmail-search-update-relevant-emails/" target="_blank">blog post</a> today, March 20. While the old version of search in Gmail showed the most recent keyword results in emails, the upgraded version will "now factor in elements like recency, most-clicked emails and frequent contacts."</p><p>The AI-powered search feature is arriving in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gmail">Gmail</a> as "Most relevant" results. Users can now toggle between "Most relevant" and "Most recent," depending on the situation. Previously, Gmail defaulted to showing "Most recent" search results, and that was the only option available.</p><p>"With this update, the emails you’re looking for are far more likely to be at the top of your search results — saving you valuable time and helping you find important information more easily," the company explains in the blog post.</p><p>You can see an example of how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gmail-android-how-to">Gmail</a> search results are changing in the graphic below, which shows the old results on the left and the new ones on the right.</p>

<p>The new version of search is rolling out worldwide in Gmail's web client, as well as the iOS and Android mobile apps. The feature will begin exclusive to personal Google accounts, though the company says it will expand upgraded Gmail search to business accounts "in the future."</p><p>Google has been steadily upgrading Gmail with artificial intelligence to make it easier to use, and more secure. At the end of last year, Gmail became equipped with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gmail-now-uses-a-new-ai-model-to-try-and-fend-off-holiday-scams">a new AI model designed to thwart phishing scams in emails</a>. This addition following similar scam-stopping AI features being added to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-now-has-smarter-detection-to-tackle-tricky-scam-messages">Google Messages</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/real-time-scam-detection-is-rolling-out-now-in-google-phone-app-beta">Google Phone</a>.</p><p>Time will tell whether users prefer the new version of Gmail search over the old one. For people who constantly have to scroll to find old emails, "Most relevant" results may be more helpful. For others, switching back to "Most recent" could be a better option.</p>

That knocks the price of the super-powered smartphone down to only $499, which is <em>the same price</em> that the Pixel 9a is scheduled to have when it finally hits store shelves next month. No trade-in required, zero hassle involved. </p><p>To be totally honest, I&apos;m half-expecting Best Buy to remove the deal when they realize they&apos;ve made a mistake, so <strong>I&apos;d jump on this opportunity </strong><em><strong>fast</strong></em> if you&apos;re interested. </p>

<p><strong>Heads up, Google fans: this is NOT a test. </strong>You can buy the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> from Best Buy and get a whopping $600 off your purchase with carrier activation. That means you're getting Google's best device for the price of the budget-friendly Pixel 9a with no trade-in required. </p>
<p>The retailer is also offering up to $840 of trade-in credit when you send in an old or broken device, which means you could even get the phone for free if you're lucky. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/google-pixel-9-pro-xl-128gb-unlocked-obsidian/6587896.p" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="75095aa8-13aa-4c7a-b2a7-f6c6c23b8966" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,099" data-dimension48="$1,099">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>Google&apos;s answer to the premium Galaxy S25 Ultra, the Pixel 9 Pro XL is a super-powered device with a huge 6.8-inch AMOLED display, efficient Tensor G4 processor, and an impressive 16GB of RAM. You also get the latest AI-boosted software features, seven years of OS/security updates, and all of the fancy camera tech that made Google such a legendary OEM. </p><p>If I had to dig up some drawbacks, I&apos;d say it&apos;s a shame that the phone in question only comes with 128GB of storage, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-vs-google-pixel-9-pro-xl">comparing it with the S25 Ultra</a>, you&apos;re also losing the convenience of a built-in stylus. But again, this Best Buy deal is knocking the price down to only $499, so I&apos;m not going to spend too much time complaining. By all means skip this deal if you&apos;re happy with your current phone, but if you&apos;ve already had your eye on the Pixel 9 Pro XL, this offer is worth your immediate attention. </p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">modern smartphone</a> is a marvel of miniaturization, packing the power of a desktop computer into a device that fits in your hand. At the heart of this revolution lies the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/gigahertz-versus-cores-what-makes-a-good-phone-chip">System on a Chip</a> (SoC), a single integrated circuit that houses the CPU, GPU, modem, and a host of other specialized processors.</p><p>While companies like Apple and Google are known for "building" custom smartphone chips, they don't actually manufacture them. Samsung also designs chips <em>and</em> can build them, albeit in a different division of the company. Qualcomm has changed the industry forever by designing things nobody could ever build without them, and the company lets others build the actual products.</p><p>So, how do these tech giants design and bring these powerful components to life? The answer lies in a complex interplay of design expertise, intellectual property, and a specialized manufacturing ecosystem.</p>
<h2 id="turning-an-idea-into-a-blueprint-2">Turning an idea into a blueprint</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.38%;"><img id="C5wrVzh2qxxkb6wMmzSomF" name="8-gen.jpg" alt="Snapdragon 8 Gen 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C5wrVzh2qxxkb6wMmzSomF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="451" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The journey begins with the design phase, where teams of engineers, architects, and researchers conceptualize the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/arm-announces-new-chip-architecture-focus-performance-security-and-ai">chip's architecture</a>. This involves defining the chip's functionalities, performance targets, and power efficiency goals.</p><p>For Apple, this means optimizing for iOS and its specific applications; for Google, it's about tailoring the chip to Android and its burgeoning AI capabilities. Samsung and Qualcomm need to build chips that anyone can use. It's not easy.</p><p>The core of the chip's design is its architecture. This dictates the arrangement of the various processing units and how they interact. Apple, for instance, invests heavily in its custom CPU and GPU designs, aiming for superior performance per watt. Google, with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-has-reportedly-finished-designing-the-pixel-10s-custom-tensor-g5-soc">Tensor chips</a>, focuses on integrating specialized AI accelerators for on-device machine learning. Qualcomm strikes a balance between performance in all areas and connectivity options.</p><p>Each company knows what it needs better than anyone else does.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="t5si5YMrmbX7vSmrEHpFSd" name="apple-a18-graphic" alt="Apple A18 chip graphic" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/t5si5YMrmbX7vSmrEHpFSd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Once done on paper, engineers need to describe and build out the chip's logic. Hardware Description Languages (HDL) like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.chipverify.com/tutorials/verilog" target="_blank">Verilog or VHDL</a> are used to "program" every behavior of the chip's circuits: every transistor, logic gate, and even the connections between them all.</p><p>Once someone is satisfied that this is going to work, the testing begins before anything is ever built. Software is used to simulate various behaviors, looking for bottlenecks in performance and potential errors and determining what other IP could be licensed to make a chip even better. Nothing is built in a vacuum, and no one company can do it all; the best products are a happy collaboration.</p><p>From there, the process is physically laid out by crazy smart people with backgrounds in electronics, physics, and manufacturing. Finally, parts can be built.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2149px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.31%;"><img id="pfyVzktcAoqKdPZy5xx7fc" name="samsung-exynos-chip-generic-hero.jpg" alt="Samsung Exynos chip mockup" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pfyVzktcAoqKdPZy5xx7fc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2149" height="1210" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Apple or Qualcomm don't build their own chips. Neither does Google, and even the divisions at Samsung designing new products aren't usually the same ones creating them. For that, you need a semiconductor foundry. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/is-googles-switch-from-samsung-foundry-to-tsmc-for-the-tensor-g5-chip-a-big-deal">TSMC</a> is one of the biggest, but there are others — including Samsung's own foundry.</p><p>The company that designed the chip works very closely with the foundry. There's a lot of back and forth to optimize the design for better performance and ease of manufacturing, and the final specifications are drawn out before the first chip rolls off the line.</p><p>The process of building a semiconductor is wild. Using complex masks and stencils, a chip is built layer by layer in rooms where not even a spec of dust is allowed. It's a total sci-fi vibe for a sci-fi product. The results are continually tested so the "good" chips make it to the customer who ordered them, then into your hands.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:51.38%;"><img id="QbfBkZwUt36m2vKV3HxSbA" name="galliumnitri.jpg" alt="Gallium nitride CPU wafer" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QbfBkZwUt36m2vKV3HxSbA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="411" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Arizona State University)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's easy to think of fabless semiconductor design as sort of like outsourcing, but it's a lot more than just a cost-saving initiative.</p><p>It allows a company like Apple or Qualcomm, who are well known for building excellent smartphone chips, to focus on the design and licensing of outside IP to build a product that meets consumer's exact needs.</p><p>Instead of trying to build and maintain advanced state-of-the-art facilities, they can partner with a company that has both the means and the experience to do it right. This makes adapting to an ever-changing market much easier.</p><p>Expertise in chip design, combined with strategic partnerships with leading manufacturers, allows them to create some of the most powerful and efficient smartphone chips on the market. This intricate ecosystem, where design expertise meets manufacturing prowess, is what drives the relentless innovation in the world of mobile technology.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eK5yWTTFGhV2NNhMAeyEB8" name="google-tensor-g4-pixel-9-pro-xl-1.jpg" alt="Google Tensor G4 on Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eK5yWTTFGhV2NNhMAeyEB8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The biggest bit of concrete evidence we have on the Pixel 10a so far is its processor. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/early-pixel-10a-pixel-11-series-codename-chip-leak">According to one leak</a>, the Google Pixel 10a will ship with a "boosted" version of the Tensor G4 chip inside the Pixel 9a. If so, that would mark the first time the company would ship a <em>different</em> chipset from the mainline series in a Pixel A-series phone, at least since Google started making Tensor chipsets.</p><p>Up until now, Google has shipped a nearly identical Tensor processor in A-series phones, enabling excellent photography capabilities, AI processing, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/how-many-software-updates-will-the-google-pixel-9a-get">years of promised software updates</a>. However, Google has long had an issue with performance <em>and</em> overheating, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> was the first to solve only half of that equation — the overheating issue.</p><p>A boosted Tensor G4 could mean that Google is further tweaking the Tensor G4's thermal properties, allowing the company to speed the processor up without reintroducing the old overheating problems of Pixels' past.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The Pixel 10a might be the first Tensor-based Pixel that doesn't get the same processor as the rest of the familial line.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The downside to this strategy is that the Pixel 10a wouldn't benefit from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-has-reportedly-finished-designing-the-pixel-10s-custom-tensor-g5-soc">the Tensor G5</a> that's rumored to launch inside the rest of the Pixel 10 series. While we're not expecting the Tensor G5 to introduce many major performance improvements, the new processor is rumored to come alongside a suite of changes that could prove beneficial, including a new GPU, a new ISP, and a new display processor.</p><p>This could mean that the Pixel 10a doesn't see display, camera, or gaming performance improvements compared to the rest of the Pixel 10 series. Of course, all of this is based on leaks and rumors, but it's worth noting the hypothetical.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="KJXtYDWoTq5WCEsME2AsXB" name="Google-Pixel-9a-all-four-colors-on-desk-3" alt="All four Google Pixel 9a phones in each color (Iris, Peony, Porcelain, and Obsidian) placed artistically against or in front of a wooden display." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KJXtYDWoTq5WCEsME2AsXB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>The Pixel A-series is long overdue for charging improvements and an LTPO display.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Every generation, we see Google add at least one display enhancement from the mainline Pixel series to the equivalent Pixel A-series. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a> introduced a 120Hz display for the first time in Pixel A-series history, while the Pixel 9a's display is now as bright as the ones on the rest of the Pixel 9 series. The only thing missing is LTPO technology, which we surmise Google will add next year to further improve battery life.</p><p>Speaking of battery life, the Pixel A-series is long overdue for a charging speed upgrade. Google gave the Pixel 9a a very <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/how-fast-is-the-google-pixel-9a-charging-speed">minor charging speed bump</a>, but the mainline Pixel 9 series charges <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-charging-speed">twice as fast</a>. Even that pales in comparison to competitors like OnePlus, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">offers 80W charging</a> <em>with a charger included</em> in the box. It's very possible that the Pixel 10a may finally adopt 30W charging to keep up with the pack, but I don't foresee Google doing more than that.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>We could see the return of multiple phone sizes with the Pixel 10a, something we haven't seen since the Pixel 4a days.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Lastly is the possibility that Google could finally offer multiple sizes of the Pixel 10a. The last time the company offered multiple Pixel A-series model sizes was with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-4a-5g-vs-pixel-4a">Pixel 4a and Pixel 4a 5G</a>. A rumor circled for a while that the Pixel 8a would see the return of multiple sizes, but that has yet to materialize.</p><p>While we're certainly not confident that Google <strong>will</strong> return to offering multiple sizes, the company has been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/there-are-too-many-pixel-phones">expanding its portfolio of devices</a> in recent years, so now would make a lot of sense for them to make a move like this.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-google-pixel-10a-what-we-expect-to-stay-the-same"><span>Google Pixel 10a: What we expect to stay the same</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="KAksn6WMNiah55RUJEYLCB" name="Google-Pixel-9a-all-four-colors-on-desk-2" alt="The Iris, Peony, Obsidian, and Porcelain Google Pixel 9a in a jumbled pile on a brown desk surface." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KAksn6WMNiah55RUJEYLCB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Seeing as how the Pixel 9a just drastically changed the design compared to the Pixel 6a, 7a, and 8a, we don't expect the company to change much for the Pixel 10a. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/news-weekly-march-15-2025">Pixel 10 leaks</a> show that Google is largely keeping the design identical between the Pixel 9 and Pixel 10 series, so there's not much reason to expect it would do anything different with the Pixel 10a.</p><p>Likewise, the Pixel 10a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/why-google-pixel-9a-ditched-camera-bar">ditched the camera bar</a> to make a thicker, flatter phone with a bigger battery. As such, there's little reason to expect Google to change the battery at all on the Pixel 10a. Thankfully, though, the Pixel 9a boasts the best battery life of any Tensor-based Pixel phone to date, at least on paper.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Don't expect to see many design or camera changes next year.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>On the subject of cameras, leaks show that Google may offer a telephoto camera <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-series-render-leak-reveal-identical-design">on the smaller Pixel 10</a> this year, but we haven't seen anything that points to a telephoto camera being offered on a Pixel A-series device yet. If Google does make multiple sizes of the Pixel 10a, there's a possibility that we could see the addition of a telephoto camera. Otherwise, don't count on that changing.</p><p>We also don't foresee Google changing the $499 price much, if at all, for the Pixel 10a. All things considered, Google's aim with this series is to keep it as affordable as possible. With the rumor that the Pixel 10a will be using a Tensor G4 again, plus several design changes on the Pixel 9a that make manufacturing simpler and less expensive, there's no reason to think Google will change the price in 2026.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-google-pixel-10a-potential-launch-date"><span>Google Pixel 10a: Potential launch date</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3732px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="eGdRKCDcSgTfi2m3T68miA" name="Google-Pixel-9a-vs-8a-top-down" alt="The Bay Google Pixel 8a (left) and Iris Google Pixel 9a (right) next to one another on a white desk surface." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eGdRKCDcSgTfi2m3T68miA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3732" height="2099" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Pixel 9 series was announced several months before the Pixel 8 series, launching in August 2024 instead of the traditional October timeline. That trend stayed the same with the Pixel 9a which was announced in mid-March rather than in mid-May when Google I/O takes place.</p><p>It doesn't seem like Google will repeat this trend and will likely keep the Pixel 10 series on an annual release timeline. Even if they do continue the 2-month-early trend, that means the earliest we'll hear anything official about the Google Pixel 10a will be sometime in the first quarter of 2026.</p><p>Until then, we'll be covering every leak and rumor that gives us a clearer picture of what Google's 2026 budget release will pack.</p>

<p>For the first time ever, the Pixel 9 Pro is the same size as the base model Google Pixel 9 — but fear not, things still look quite different under the hood. The Google Pixel 9 Pro boasts the Tensor G4 chipset and 16GB of RAM, plus you get an improved 42 MP front camera system and a telephoto lens (another first for Google devices). The Google Pixel 9 Pro starts at $999 for the 128GB version, and there&apos;s also a more-expensive 1TB version if you need additional storage.</p>

<p>The first two-hour session of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/starship-home-mixed-reality-game-impressions">Starship Home</a> that I finished was met with a surreal sense of spatial juxtaposition. One moment ago, my living room was a starship complete with alien plants and an infinite storage system that tied in neatly with my basement. The next moment, I was back to my normal old living room with nothing nearly as exciting in it.</p><p>Another recent mixed reality game, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/one-year-later-mixed-reality-games-are-booming">The Last Stand</a>, turned my living room into a store in the mall. This sounds rather strange until the zombies start breaking in the boarded-up windows, and you suddenly realize you've been placed in a movie frame of the classic movie Dawn of the Dead. Even after taking the headset off, I expected a zombie to break through my sliding glass door at any moment.</p><p>It's this sense of "making new memories in people's physical spaces" that gets me so excited about mixed reality games and why Meta's latest mixed reality capabilities update is so important. Meta Quest developers can now use your Meta Quest 3's cameras to create even more immersive content thanks to the updated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/unity/unity-passthrough/">camera passthrough API</a>.</p><p>So what does this mean and how is Meta protecting your privacy? Between Meta's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developers.meta.com/horizon/blog/gdc-2025-design-strategies-considerations-tips-mr-vr-horizon-os/">blog post</a>, the company's presentation at GDC, and my own discussions with Meta representatives and Meta Quest developers, I've found some rather interesting new concepts developers are working with to create the future of immersive mixed reality gaming.</p>
<h2 id="camera-data-is-the-pandora-s-box-of-mixed-reality-2">Camera data is the Pandora's Box of mixed reality</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="BnEHje5EXkFwjwLDJXywSa" name="wall-town-wonders-quest-3s-hero" alt="Playing Wall Town Wonders in mixed reality on a Meta Quest 3S" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BnEHje5EXkFwjwLDJXywSa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For a long time, Meta has restricted Meta Quest camera access to developers. Games like Starship Home, The Last Stand, The Infinite Inside, and <em>all</em> others rely entirely on what the Meta Horizon OS tells them your room looks like. These games only know your walls exist because the OS tells them. Likewise, your dining room table might be considered a desk because you defined that during the headset's setup process.</p><p>Everything was pre-baked, including the size and shape, which means developers could only work with whatever data the headset fed them. Now, thanks to a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/unity/unity-passthrough/">camera passthrough API</a>, Meta Quest apps are able to actually <strong>see</strong> your room — assuming you permit them — and understand the objects within.</p><p>Let's look at a side-by-side of what I'm talking about:</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3838px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:32.18%;"><img id="2ME7VMv4JnqRRAUdnmZEV8" name="meta-quest-3-camera-passthrough-data-march-2025" alt="Meta Quest 3 room setup and passthrough image data from the older camera space setup API" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2ME7VMv4JnqRRAUdnmZEV8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3838" height="1235" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>The current mixed reality kit is very boxy. Future apps and games will finally understand room geometry and nuance that makes mixed reality games more convincing.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>While the headset is mapping your room during the initial setup process, you'll see it building a complex mesh of polygons so it can recreate your physical space in a virtual environment. This data was previously only accessible by the headset itself and never shared with an app.</p><p>Instead, the app would only be given the data on the right. Notice how the box that defines my couches doesn't line up with the actual height of the couch since the couch <em>isn't a box</em>? The same problem occurs with my dining room table, which is oval in shape, yet the older room setup only allows for square or rectangular tables.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3kgH2xvfmRuj88rbWTvqZD" name="meta-quest-3-camera-passthrough-mixed-reality-game" alt="Virtual characters standing on top of a physical couch unconvincingly due to geometry constraints of older Meta Quest space understanding models" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3kgH2xvfmRuj88rbWTvqZD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Soon, these characters in Twenty Guys may be standing on your actual couch instead of the predefined boundaries the headset creates. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>This new solution allows apps and games to better identify the space around you, resulting in more realistic (and less hokey) mixed reality experiences.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Now that Meta is expanding the use of camera data to apps, developers may soon be able to program their apps and games to more intelligently understand the geometry of objects. That means no more weirdly floating characters in a mixed-reality space.</p><p>That also means when a virtual object hides behind a physical one, it'll look much more convincing since it won't be hiding behind a square box but, instead, your rather curvy living room chair. This can extend to zombies banging on your windows instead of virtual recreations of a window, goop oozing out of sinks, spiders <em>convincingly </em>crawling out of vents, etc.</p>
<h2 id="the-future-is-in-flux-2">The future is in flux</h2>
<p>After Apple Vision Pro launched, lots of people came up with interesting ideas of what mixed reality concepts could look like. Some used mixed reality to gamify chores so you can vacuum <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OculusQuest/comments/19dpo3v/spatial_vacuuming_never_miss_a_spot_again/">and never miss a spot again</a>. Apps like this will work even better now that they have access to camera data, as they'll be able to properly identify areas rather than just using prebuilt data from the headset.</p><p>Others used the idea to completely transform their rooms into completely different decor using generative AI. While this video is a mockup and not a real app you can use today, it might give you an idea of what to expect from mixed reality concepts in the future:</p>
<div class="instagram-embed"><blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version="6" style="width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);"><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DBbdiGqJxpk/" target="_blank">A post shared by Technology (@technology)</a></p><p>A photo posted by  on </p></blockquote></div>
<p>The new passthrough camera API is built upon <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/media/camera/camera2">Android's Camera2 API</a>, according to Meta, helping it tie deeply in with the Quest's hardware. This means apps can utilize data from the camera and adjust it as needed, helping virtual objects to better match the lighting and color of your room.</p><p>Things look different during sunlit days than they do in artificial nighttime light, and this new API can help play a part in making those virtual objects look more convincing in your actual space.</p><p>In addition to that, the new API lets apps use the Quest's camera to capture imagery of your room and add it to virtual objects. This can be as simple as taking a picture of a person's face and adding it to a rudimentary character model — as you see above — or something more realistic like your actual living room reflecting in a pool of virtual water in a game.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>The new passthrough API allows the Quest's cameras to capture your room and put it on virtual objects, or just more seamlessly blend the virtual and real worlds.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Better spatial awareness will enable your headset to further transform the room around you into something both familiar yet unique and always memorable. Spatial awareness holds a special meaning for our brains and even bespoke experiences like this masterful airplane cockpit someone built.</p><p>From what I've seen, this is one of the most convincing uses of mixed reality to date. Most people don't have access to an empty airplane cockpit in their garage, but being able to turn your favorite chair into a convincing airplane cockpit — complete with its texture accurately positioned inside the virtual cockpit — would make an incredibly convincing game of Flight Simulator without all the expensive add-ons and accessories some people spend a lot of money on.</p><p>As with anything XR, this is just the beginning of something new and interesting that'll play a part in what's coming down the line. Google's upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a> operating system also allows passthrough access for apps, meaning developers can get a jump start on making concepts now so that games and apps are more mature when that OS — and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">future AR glasses hardware</a> — begins shipping to customers, content will be there waiting for them.</p>
