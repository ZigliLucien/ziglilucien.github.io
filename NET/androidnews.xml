It's a time to raise awareness about the causes of preventable injuries and highlight ways to stay safe. In 2025, technology is a key part of that. The best Android phones have built-in tools and features for personal safety, including some you may not know about.</p><p>Most people looking for a flagship Android phone will probably be choosing between the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25" target="_blank">Samsung Galaxy S25 series</a>, the Google Pixel 9 lineup, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13" target="_blank">OnePlus 13</a>. Each of these devices has its own personal safety features, plus the default options built into Android. Depending on which phone you choose, you'll get a different set of personal safety features.</p><p>In light of National Safety Month, we're going to highlight the personal safety suites available on each of these popular phones.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-series-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 series</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xETzw2tvXYbiYMQtZhF9SV" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-backs-all-colors-05" alt="All four colors of the Samsung Galaxy S25" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xETzw2tvXYbiYMQtZhF9SV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While the Samsung Galaxy S25 series does include a respectable set of personal safety features, the story of this lineup is untapped potential. It <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-galaxy-s25-series-could-borrow-this-safety-feature-from-apple-and-google">has a car crash detection sensor that is currently unused</a>, and a satellite connectivity feature that is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-samsung-galaxy-s25-series-supports-satellite-connectivity-but-theres-a-catch">left up to carriers rather than being universal</a>.</p><p>The smartphones do have an Emergency SOS feature that can be used to get help in an emergency. Once you've set it up, clicking the Galaxy S25's power button three or four times will initiate Emergency SOS. This will send an SOS message with your location in both address and map form to your emergency contacts.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Samsung Galaxy S25</a> adds a unique capability to the standard Emergency SOS feature. You can optionally set Emergency SOS to automatically capture a photo with the front and rear cameras. Another toggle lets your phone send and record a five-second audio clip as well. This could help give your emergency contacts and first responders crucial context for your situation.</p><p>Aside from Emergency SOS, your Galaxy S25 will also support medical info viewable from the lock screen and wireless emergency alerts. It'll also use satellite connectivity if you have Verizon service.</p><p>You can view all of the available options by opening the <strong>Settings app</strong> and navigating to <strong>Safety & emergency</strong>. From there, you can set up Emergency SOS, medical info, and more.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="6e93792c-820d-4d9e-84d3-99b5d0c338c9">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a4f5rfEmrjTaKHrSuXcCg4.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy S25 in Icyblue official render"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy S25</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>A decent pick for safety</strong></em></p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 gives you access to core Android safety features, and also supports satellite connectivity if you are on the right network.

In fact, Pixels get their own Personal Safety app for accessing and managing these tools.

Unlike the Galaxy S25, which requires a supported carrier for satellite service, Satellite SOS is included by Google with the Pixel 9 lineup. Essentially, if you are out of range of a cell tower, your phone can fall back to a satellite to contact first responders in an emergency.</p><p>You can try Satellite SOS without straining critical resources by using the demo mode. All you need to do is go to <strong>Settings</strong> > <strong>Safety & emergency</strong> > <strong>Satellite SOS</strong> and follow the on-screen prompts to test it out for yourself.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="G2vaeYP5DXV6jGEb9wGzdf" name="Pixel-car-crash-detection-pixel-6a.jpg" alt="Car Crash Detection on a Google Pixel 6a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/G2vaeYP5DXV6jGEb9wGzdf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>From there, you also get Car Crash Detection, which uses sensors and algorithms to detect when you've been in a car accident. When a crash is detected, you'll have about a minute to confirm you're OK or need help. If you don't respond, your phone will automatically reach emergency services on your behalf.

Some phones take that further, like the Galaxy S25 and its photo and audio recording Emergency SOS capabilities. Or, the Pixel 9's support for Car Crash Detection, Satellite SOS, and Safety Check.</p><p>It's probably not worth buying a smartphone <em>only</em> for its personal safety features, but there are a few exceptions. For instance, if I often hiked or ran in areas without cell coverage, I'd absolutely look for a phone with satellite connectivity. A professional driver spending tens of thousands of miles on the road annually might similarly consider Car Crash Detection an essential feature.</p><p>It's worth considering your own habits and needs before making a choice, and don't forget that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best smartwatches</a> have unique personal safety features of their own.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>MVNO deals: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/"><u><strong>Mint Mobile</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.visible.com/plans/"><u><strong>Visible</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://deals.boostmobile.com/mypromo/trial-mybm"><u><strong>Boost</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://tello.com/buy/custom_plans"><u><strong>Tello</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.cricketwireless.com/cell-phone-plans"><u><strong>Cricket</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>Carrier deals: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers"><u><strong>T-Mobile</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><u><strong>Mint Mobile</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.visible.com/deals/"><u><strong>Visible</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The company recently took to X to confirm that the device will show up with a 50MP periscope lens. Nothing said that the camera is "built for creators," and while the camera's optical zoom capability also remains under wraps, the company shared a couple of photos that were taken using said lens, marketing the phone in the usual "Nothing" style.</p><p>That said, while the London-based company was dropping crumbs, a new leak pretty much showed us what the entire cake looked like. The leak suggests that Nothing Phone 3 will have three 50MP cameras, and that the camera placement on the Nothing Phone 3 will be unique. The top camera is off to the side, and the other two lenses are placed at the bottom next to each other.</p><p>The phone may have a 6.7-inch OLED display and be available in black and white colors. As for the device's battery, it is rumored to have a massive 5,150mAh capacity, and the glyph matrix interface on the rear panel.</p><p>The launch will take place on July 1.</p><h2 id="google-s-xr-glasses-might-have-a-unique-name-2">Google's XR Glasses might have a unique name</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="83zuR5C9JNo8wg767MHyo8" name="Android-XR-demo-Google-io-2025-5" alt="Android XR prototype glasses and Pixel smartphones" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/83zuR5C9JNo8wg767MHyo8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/googles-android-xr-glasses-are-reportedly-code-named-google-martha"><strong>here</strong></a><strong></strong></p><p>Google's XR Glasses were the talk of the town after their appearance at Google I/O this year.

You get a set of controls at the top that let you power the device on or off, switch between lighting modes, and change the music playback and volume of the built-in speaker.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="k4eivHJqxhGmG9U74YBMw3" name="Govee Table Lamp 2 Pro" alt="Govee Table Lamp 2 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/k4eivHJqxhGmG9U74YBMw3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The speaker grille is also located up top, and it's easy enough to connect the table lamp to your phone if you just want to use it as a Bluetooth speaker. On that note, the sound quality is quite good; you get a good mid-range and decent treble, but it misses out on low-end energy — it just doesn't deliver the kind of rumble and vibrancy that you normally get on most portable speakers.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rhDKGAshkzHMLNq4RfYQx3" name="Govee Table Lamp 2 Pro" alt="Govee Table Lamp 2 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rhDKGAshkzHMLNq4RfYQx3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's some mid-bass, but you don't get any sub-bass extension. This is likely to do with the design as there isn't much room to house the acoustic cavity, so if you want a Bluetooth speaker that has engaging bass, this isn't the best choice. Thankfully, there's no distortion when you increase the volume, so that's good to see.

That said, other the weedy bass, there isn't much wrong with the audio in general.</p><p>I wasn't able to test the stereo sound feature as I got just the one unit of this table lamp, but I wouldn't recommend it if you want a device mostly for listening to music. Outside of that quibble, there are no downsides here; the LEDs get bright enough that I didn't have to set it to over 50% most of the time, and the diffused light is the highlight.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="cZMF86zrmuCvUXhM8QnWx3" name="Govee Table Lamp 2 Pro" alt="Govee Table Lamp 2 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cZMF86zrmuCvUXhM8QnWx3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Connectivity is rock-solid; you can use it as a Bluetooth speaker, and the lighting portion connects to your home network (over the 2.4GHz band).

It has LAN control as well, so if you use Home Assistant, you can use the platform to control the device.</p><p>There's a 5,200mAh battery that lets you use the table lamp anywhere, and I'm hesitant to take this outdoors; it is good as a party speaker, but it doesn't quite have the rugged design that you get with most outdoor Bluetooth speakers.

It also means that we&apos;re going to be experiencing a hectic week of sale events across the web, with all of your favorite websites and influencers alike inundating you with dozens of deals on everything from kitchen appliances to smartphones.</p><p>I&apos;ve been working sale events like this long enough that I know exactly how to breeze through the week of Prime Day with relatively little stress.

Do your research</h2><p>This one might be a bit obvious, but if you plan to make a major purchase during Prime Day, it&apos;s important to do a little research beforehand so you know what you&apos;re looking for. Simply shopping for "any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a>" during the sale, for instance, could lead to buyer&apos;s remorse when you realize that you didn&apos;t read up on these devices before making a purchase. </p><p>Start by considering what&apos;s important to <em>you </em>personally when you use your devices. Do you just need something simple and affordable? Maybe great cameras or battery life? What about AI features or long software support? Reading up on the best Android tech beforehand is a great way to make sure you&apos;re prepared when the big sale goes live. </p><p>Start shopping on July 8th with a wish list of the items you&apos;re interested in. That&apos;ll keep you from feeling overwhelmed and ensure you feel confident in your purchase once that order confirmation page appears. After all, tech can be expensive, and every penny counts these days. </p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-tip-2-look-at-price-history"><span>Tip #2: Look at price history</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Nuw4Jq35aqgLoA6B4jZxR8" name="samsung-ecosystem-galaxy-s25-ultra-3" alt="Samsung ecosystem of devices including the Galaxy S25 Ultra, Galaxy Watch Ultra, Buds 3 Pro, Samsung laptop, and Tab S10 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Nuw4Jq35aqgLoA6B4jZxR8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="2-look-at-price-history-2">2. Look at price history</h2><p>When these major sale events go live, it can be hard to tell if a deal is actually good or if the retailer is just trying to make you <em>think</em> it&apos;s good. Items marked with text like "<em>Lightning Deal" </em>can make you feel a sense of urgency on a discount that isn&apos;t necessarily that special. This is where price tracking tools come in handy. </p><p>Websites like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/"><strong>Camelcamelcamel.com</strong></a> let you check the complete price history on items sold through Amazon. Pasting the product page URL into the site&apos;s search field will give you a timeline of every instance that the item has been discounted, plus it will tell if you the current discount is record-breaking or if we&apos;ve seen it before. This can be helpful if you&apos;re trying to decide between making a major purchase today or waiting a few more months to buy.</p><p>The problem with websites like Camelcamelcamel is that the data can be a bit unreliable if a product has a lot of different color variants or storage configurations. Information can also be disrupted if the item has too many third-party sellers. Still, I wouldn&apos;t make any purchase on Amazon without at least attempting to check the price history first. </p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-tip-3-check-rival-sales"><span>Tip #3: Check rival sales</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1092px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="kowZWDXxMbtmxrruqre7Y3" name="prime-day-2023-amazon-ad-169.jpg" alt="Prime Day 2023 ad" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kowZWDXxMbtmxrruqre7Y3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1092" height="615" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Amazon)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="3-check-rival-sales-2">3. Check rival sales</h2><p>Of course, whenever Amazon launches a Prime Day event, you can expect most of its competitors to launch rival sales around the same time. Many of these sales match or beat Amazon&apos;s prices, which can be great if you don&apos;t have a Prime membership and aren&apos;t interested in joining (even though <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><strong>there&apos;s a 30-day trial</strong></a> that lets you shop the sale for free). </p><p>Before you buy an Android device from Amazon during Prime Day, see if Best Buy or Walmart is offering an equal or better deal. Don&apos;t forget to check for extra perks too. Buying a tablet from Amazon may get you the device alone, but purchasing the same tablet for the same price during <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-buy-takes-on-amazon-with-an-epic-sale-of-its-own-see-the-top-5-android-deals-that-actually-matter">Best Buy&apos;s sale</a> might also get you three free months of Apple Music or a free trial to Xbox Game Pass. </p><p>Retailers like Best Buy and Samsung may also offer enhanced trade-in credit during their respective sale events, which could land you some additional savings if you have an old or broken device lying around. Needless to say, we&apos;ll be covering all of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/deals">best Android deals</a> from across the web that week — regardless of the source — so you can always check with us if you&apos;re unsure about a discount.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-tip-4-watch-out-for-scams"><span>Tip #4: Watch out for scams</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:627px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:35.09%;"><img id="oeCPLS4FcxuTWiGikoxpFF" name="amazon-scam-detail.png" alt="An example of a scam text sent by a phony USPS rep" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oeCPLS4FcxuTWiGikoxpFF.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="627" height="220" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="4-watch-out-for-scams-2">4. Watch out for scams</h2><p>Although Prime Day presents itself as the perfect opportunity to find great deals this summer, it&apos;s also an opportunity for scammers to target your data and bank account. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/amazon-prime-day-scams-to-look-for">Reports of scams and phishing attempts</a> increase dramatically during the sale event, and it&apos;s easy to fall victim to these traps if you&apos;re not careful.</p><p>Watch out for emails or texts that are trying to compel you to click on a link concerning a recent purchase, especially if you haven&apos;t placed an order lately. These scammers will often try to impersonate Amazon representatives or mail providers and will send emails from suspicious sources like "amazonusa[.]shop" or "amazonindo[.]com". Other dishonest agents may attempt to contact you by phone. </p><p>Rule of thumb, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=G4YFYCCNUSENA23B"><strong>Amazon clearly expresses</strong></a> on its site, representatives <em>"will never send you an unsolicited message that asks you to provide sensitive personal information like your social insurance number, tax ID, bank account number, credit card information, ID questions like your mother&apos;s maiden name or your password".</em> </p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-tip-5-stay-calm"><span>Tip #5: Stay calm</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Qw6TDQtQPLtcSn5Xc9qwHH" name="Garmin Fenix 8 vs. Galaxy Watch Ultra 5" alt="Garmin Fenix 8 vs. Galaxy Watch Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Qw6TDQtQPLtcSn5Xc9qwHH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael L Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="5-stay-calm-2">5. Stay calm</h2><p>Last but not least, if you want to have a good time shopping this Prime Day, it&apos;s important to stay calm. Email newsletters, search engines, and even celebrities will be flooding the airwaves that week with breathless endorsements and recommendations for top products, and it&apos;s important to remember that it&apos;s <em>just a sale</em>. </p><p>Don&apos;t get carried away by a false sense of urgency and buy a bunch of items you don&apos;t need, and don&apos;t get so overwhelmed by the flood of information that you end up missing a truly great deal. By simply researching products beforehand and preparing a list of everything you need in advance, you can wake up on the morning of July 8th and shop for deals at your leisure. </p><p>And don&apos;t forget: the entire Android Central staff (including yours truly) will be around to share our favorite deals and provide helpful shopping advice during the sale, so you&apos;ll never feel too lost. </p><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-2025-early-deals-and-faq"><em><strong>Prime Day returns July 8th-11th: see best early deals and FAQ</strong></em></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The splash page detailed a "Try a lock screen clock that fits to your photos" feature addition. When scrolling through the new additions in more detail, Samsung's video clip shows how the lock screen clock will morph around items in your chosen photo.</p><p>From the tipster's clip, the clock can recognize and shift around a person's head or other items in your photo for a more modern, artistic approach to your lock screen. In the beta, Samsung itself says this new clock function "works with people and animals."</p><p>This lock screen change grants the clock its own unique font when morphing. Depending on the angle or slant/curve in a photo, the clock will elongate or increase its size to fit perfectly alongside it. The publication also cites prominent tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1938416143670382976">Ice Universe</a>, who spotted one important aspect: this stylistic change only works when the lock screen is fully active.</p><p>When using Samsung's AOD (always-on display), the morphing aspects of the clock remain neutral; however, when the lock screen is fully awakened, it will shift around the photo, as expected.</p><h2 id="one-ui-8-has-a-lot-on-the-way-2">One UI 8 has a lot on the way</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">New lock screen customization feature (One UI 8 BYFB) pic.twitter.com/vDuPitpec6<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1938257024069865840">June 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>One UI 8 finally hit the Galaxy S25 series <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/samsung-one-ui-8-first-beta-announced-for-galaxy-s25-series">at the end of May</a>. The initial beta packed a ton of upgrades to what users found in One UI 7. Already, the beta showcased improvements for the Now Bar and Now Brief, bringing more customized insights and suggests for daily tasks. Auracast is picking up audio connection via QR code scanning. Additionally, in One UI 8's beta, users can sync with multiple Auracast devices.</p><p>A couple of more apps like the Reminders app and the Calendar picked up updates, as well.</p><p>On a related note, Samsung's Gallery app was spotted with a new feature: "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-could-get-you-a-secret-vault-for-your-photos-in-one-ui-8">Private Album</a>." Designed to keep your sensitive photos and videos away from prying eyes, this feature had led speculation to believe its a "simpler" version of Samsung's Secure Folder, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/one-ui-8-secure-folder-private-spaces-upgrade-rumored">might also get an upgrade</a>. This one would be specifically dedicated to your photos and videos without having to set up Secure Folder just to see that content. This is expected to arrive alongside One UI 8.</p><p>It's unclear when One UI 8 (Android 16) will hit Samsung's devices, though there are rumors that its next foldable will debut with the software (with the stable release alongside it).</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Specifically, Google states it's addressing an prominent issue users have voiced in feedback reports about how "slow" Ask Photos is at returning results. However, this seems to be restricted to the AI's ability to fulfill queries about general/broad things like "beaches" and "dogs," per Google.</p><p>The update beginning to rollout this week should make Ask Photos a lot faster at returning answers, but the AI won't stop there.</p><p>Google says "You’ll now see results right away" when asking about broader topics you may have in your gallery. Gemini will keep working behind-the-scenes to "find the most relevant photos or information." From the post's example, it seems that Ask Photos will immediately fulfill your query with a grid view of images that correlate to your interest.</p><p>Above that will be a smooth Gemini animation of it looking through your photos before delivering the "Best Results" that it think matches your search.</p><h2 id="ask-gemini-photos-2">Ask (Gemini) Photos</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:537px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:111.73%;"><img id="hEitAw9AxBy2uN9FNChNKj" name="google-photos-ask-photos-quicker-answers" alt="Google Photos is boosting Ask Photos with quicker response times for broad/simple queries, while Gemini works in the background for more a more detailed/specific response." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hEitAw9AxBy2uN9FNChNKj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="537" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Joining this update is a wider rollout of Ask Photos in Google Photos.

Throughout its testing, Gemini has remained at the center of the feature to help users discover content you have via your text query. Gemini was given the ability to understand queries based on people, food, and places but, as we've seen from reported user feedback, the AI can take a little longer than some would like.</p><p>Now, fulfilling these requests should come a lot faster for users just looking for a wide range of what they have.</p><p>Ask Photos also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-ask-photos-ui-search-redesign-rollout">underwent a slight UI rework</a> earlier this year.

It's also this UI that'll be flooded with your photos as Gemini tries to find what you're looking for, alongside its text reply of the content it found for you.</p> ]]></dc:content>

According to YouTube, on July 22, it will boost the minimum streaming age from 13 to 16. Young content creators who are 16 or older can live stream with their chat enabled and without facing any takedowns (other than if you're flagged for copyright violations).

My <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> hits about the same battery life with 590mAh capacity, and it costs and weighs <em>much</em> more.</p><p>The OnePlus Watch 2R is on the thick side for a watch, but since it weighs 22g/0.8oz less than the OnePlus Watch 3, I don't think you'll mind. And I think you'll like its sporty look, with the silver case and 24-hour GMT scale bezel around the display.</p><p>Need evidence? I held a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-held-a-smartwatch-beauty-pageant-with-surprising-results">smartwatch beauty pageant with my family</a> last Christmas, and the Watch 2R beat the Pixel Watch 3, several Galaxy Watches, an Apple Watch, and some fitness watches; it only lost to a hybrid watch, which barely counts.

You can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oneplus.com/us/launch/2025-summer-launch-event">save $30</a> by subscribing to OnePlus's newsletter, so assuming the price hasn't changed, you must choose whether $319 for the best experience or $179 for the Watch 2R fits your budget.</p><p>Even though the Watch 3 43mm will be technically better, the Watch 2R doesn't feel like a compromise compared to <em>other</em> brands. It's due to receive Wear OS 5 soon, and most likely Gemini with it, so the software will still feel fresh. And it'll spare you the headache of frequent charging you get with most smartwatches.</p><h2 id="oneplus-watch-2r-alternatives-2">OnePlus Watch 2R alternatives</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="MLBUy5ULSWnwQV847qeXMc" name="OnePlus-Watch-2R-apps.jpeg" alt="The apps drawer on the OnePlus Watch 2R." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MLBUy5ULSWnwQV847qeXMc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a> is a good alternative right now at $199.

It'll depend on which type of Android phone you have: Samsung watches have a lot of exclusive features requiring Galaxy phones, while the Watch 2R works seamlessly on any Android brand.</p><p>You can also go even cheaper with a Galaxy Watch FE or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ticwatch-pro-5-review">TicWatch Pro 5</a>, both majorly discounted right now on Amazon. Of the two, the Pro 5 has comparable performance, display quality, and battery life, but Mobvoi's slow updates and lack of Google Assistant make it a little harder to recommend. And Samsung's Fan Edition hardware is too outdated, in my opinion. Look at your options, but consider the Watch 2R first.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-pwm-refresh-rate">made this same upgrade</a> with the Galaxy S24 family and kept the same 480Hz rate on the Galaxy S25 family.</p><p>However, Android Authority reports that they've only found hints that Google will be upgrading the Pro lineup, not the baseline Pixel 10. Not only that, but 480Hz doesn't come close to resolving the issue some users have with PWM dimming, as it still fails to meet basic <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2022-11/ssl-miller-lehman_flicker_lightfair2015.pdf">IEEE flicker standards</a>. For that, Google would have to use at least 1920Hz PWM dimming, while competitors like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Honor Magic 7 Pro</a> use 4320Hz PWM dimming.</p><h2 id="some-signs-of-hope-2">(Some) signs of hope</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="VwNNCjoCRXqwjC9eZsGviS" name="Google-Pixel-9-Pro-XL-vs-Vivo-X100-Pro-display-pwm-rate" alt="Comparing the fast, low modulation PWM rate of the Vivo X100 Pro (left) with the slow, high modulation PWM rate of the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL (right)." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VwNNCjoCRXqwjC9eZsGviS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Back in April, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/potential-display-dimming-update-for-google-pixel-devices">Google told me</a> that it was "aware and investigating this" issue and that "you can expect updates later this year." Presumably, that meant the Pixel 10 series, and it looks like all signs point to some improvements coming down the pike.</p><p>When I spoke to Android Authority's Mishaal Rahman about the code found that hints at PWM dimming improvements, it seemed that Google might have an additional accessibility setting that further improves the PWM rate for users "with sensitive eyes," as the setting is named.</p><p>Phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Motorola Razr Ultra 2025</a> already include accessibility settings for users with flicker sensitivity, so there's no reason Google can't do the same. This way, it could have the best of both worlds, providing excellent displays on Pixels while allowing them to be more eye-friendly.</p><div><blockquote><p>My hope is that the rumored accessibility setting for sensitive eyes allows users to further upgrade this dimming rate, because 480Hz just isn't fast enough to help the problem.</p></blockquote></div><p>I know Google can ramp up the PWM dimming rate to 10x the current rate and well beyond, as I proved <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-display-upgrade">when I upgraded the Pixel 8 Pro's PWM dimming</a> rate to 4800Hz. Google often uses lower PWM rates because it can ensure the brightest displays on the market, but users like me care a lot more about the headaches these displays cause than the brightness level.</p><h2 id="i-want-to-use-pixels-again-2">I want to use Pixels again</h2><p>My hope is that Google brings the base PWM rate up for all users and offers a way for sensitive users like me to further ramp up the PWM dimming frequency. As it stands, I cannot use Pixel phones as my daily driver anymore because their incredibly bright displays flicker at too slow a rate and give me eye pain and headaches.</p><p>Otherwise, I'll have to wait at least another year until Google is able to further upgrade its displays to be friendlier to anyone with flicker sensitivity. Either way, we'll find out quite soon as we expect Google to announce the Pixel 10 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-release-date">in the next few weeks</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

A recent listing from an Italian electronics site has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nieuwemobiel.nl/062704/25174/Exclusief-Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Fold-7-en-Flip-7-in-winkel-gespot-met-heftige-prijs.html" target="_blank">stirred up some unease</a>, hinting at a price bump of €100 and €200 for the Flip 7 and Fold 7, respectively. For fans hoping to upgrade, that potential hike is adding a bit of sticker shock to the hype.</p><p>But there’s a silver lining after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,151688.html" target="_blank">WinFuture</a> has shared fresh intel that might ease the panic. According to the website, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 could stick pretty close to last year’s price tag (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/latest-galaxy-z-fold-flip-7-price-leak-awesome-news/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>). That’s a relief for anyone dreading a major price jump, and a nice change of pace from the earlier, more alarming leaks.</p><p>But the real shocker is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a>: the report says it could actually launch for a lower price than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>, potentially by about €100 in Europe (which could translate to a similar drop in other markets like the US).</p><h2 id="leaked-prices-look-solid-2">Leaked prices look solid</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1420px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="YaJRZ55FSd99dF9ZiDMY8P" name="Galaxy-Z-Flip-7-and-Fold-7" alt="Renders of the Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Fold 7 leak" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YaJRZ55FSd99dF9ZiDMY8P.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1420" height="799" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headline)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This means the Z Flip 7 could start at €1,099 for 256GB and €1,219 for 512GB. Meanwhile, the Z Fold 7 is rumored to land at €1,999 for 256GB, €2,119 for 512GB, and €2,359 for the 1TB model.</p><p>For some price context in Europe: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> is sitting at €1,999, €2,119, or €2,359 depending on the memory configuration. Meanwhile, the Z Flip 6 goes for either €1,199 or €1,319, based on how much storage you're after.</p><p>Samsung has been wrestling with one big issue for years now in terms of bringing down the price of its foldables. Rising global production costs haven’t helped, and with all the rumored high-end upgrades coming to the next models, it’s been looking more like prices would go up.</p><h2 id="leaks-aren-t-gospel-but-2">Leaks aren’t gospel, but...</h2><p>Of course, these are still just leaks, but the source has a pretty good track record.

They also do an excellent job with ANC, with the mode tuning out ambient noise like the hum of an AC, traffic sounds, or a jet engine.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You don't like buds with a snug fit, and you need a case with Qi charging.</p><p>Weighing just 4.8g, the Air 5 Pro are one of the lightest earbuds around, and the contoured design of the shell means you get a secure fit without any issues. I didn't notice any problems in this regard in the month I used the earbuds, and you're not trading in battery life either — these buds manage to last seven hours on a full charge with the noise-isolating mode engaged.</p><p>They don't miss out on the basics; they use Qualcomm's QCC3091 Bluetooth 5.4 modem, and you get dual device connectivity as standard. The 6-mic array does a good job with calls in general, and they get IPX5 ingress protection, making the buds a good choice for workouts.</p><p>High-resolution audio is a clear area of differentiation, and these buds get AptX, AptX Adaptive, and AptX Lossless codecs as part of the Snapdragon Sound.

driver delivers fantastic sound; you get rumbling bass with great vibrancy, clean mids, and a good treble extension. There's the ability to customize the sound to your tastes via EQ, and there's a low-latency mode that's ideal if you're using these buds while playing games on your phone.</p><p>I got seven hours of usage out of the 35mAh battery within each earbud, and the case has a 520mAh battery. The case itself is pocketable, and the buds get fast charging that gives you 90 minutes to music playback with just a 10-minute charge.</p><p>Honestly, I can't find much to fault with these buds; they have excellent sound, all the extras I need, and they don't cost anywhere as much as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/xiaomi-buds-5-pro-sound-qualcomm-xpan">Xiaomi Buds 5 Pro</a> or any of the other earbuds I tested recently.

In the past, the Galaxy Watch 5 cost $30 more than the Watch 4, while the Watch 6 cost $20 more than the Watch 5. Price inflation isn't uncommon in this lineup.</p><p>The leaked info also suggests that the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic will cost "just under €500," about a €50 jump over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Watch 6 Classic</a> 47mm. However, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-2">Galaxy Watch Ultra (2025)</a> is said to have an unchanged price tag of €699, or $649 in the U.S.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/these-leaked-renders-are-your-best-look-yet-at-the-galaxy-watch-8-series">Leaked renders</a> of the Galaxy Watch 8 series in recent weeks have shown a significant redesign for the series, with a more square-shaped case across the lineup.

If the Watch 8 Classic costs about $450–500, the jump to $650 for the Ultra might look less onerous to some buyers than it did from $300.</p><p>Samsung may also try to append a Samsung Health subscription on top of the Galaxy Watch 8; a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-explores-possible-galaxy-watch-fitness-subscription-report">Samsung senior VP of health said</a> last week that it was "exploring" putting "advanced coaching features" behind a premium paywall.

If the chat you're in has an excess of unread messages, WhatsApp states there will be a banner at the start of those texts. Users can tap this banner to activate Meta AI's summarization capabilities.</p><p>WhatsApp says that neither it nor Meta will ever know what those messages were, nor will they know what the AI summarized. Additionally, on you're aware of that summary (no one else will know that you didn't read their texts individually).</p><p>It seems that the service's summaries will deliver its information in a bullet point format. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-ai-gets-new-ways-to-communicate">Meta AI</a> will seemingly do its best to list as many key points as possible, even calling people out by name, so you have as much to go on as possible.</p><p>This feature is rolling out for English users in the U.S. this week.

It focused on enhancing the business experience, so those users could do so with less resistance. To help, WhatsApp rolled out "Ads in Status" as a way to help small or large businesses grow and reach new people more easily.</p><p>WhatsApp also added "Promoted Channels."

The post states this new carousel will contain suggested "videos and topic descriptions" based on your query. It's also good to note that not every query will return this AI-powered highlight (kind of like something more Google-related).</p><p>In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/6COYibrEk54?feature=share">its Short</a>, YouTube states Premium users need only pose a query to the platform, like "best beaches in Hawaii."</p><p>The carousel will be marked by Google's classic AI star with "Highlights" as its title. Beneath that, users will find a highlighted video clip, as well as several subsequent video thumbnails that will help enhance the information. Users can tap on these thumbnails to see a short clip play; however, tapping the clips opens the video in full on that creator's channel.</p><p>More than that, every clip is given its own AI-generated title and description. These <em>should </em>be relevant to your query, with YouTube stating these descriptions will "show how it matches your search." Ideally, these text boxes should hold useful insights about places you're interested in seeing or products. It's a good rule of thumb to remember that features like this can slip up at times, so be wary of that.</p><h2 id="youtube-gets-some-ai-lovin-2">YouTube gets some AI lovin'</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6COYibrEk54" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>YouTube adds that this AI search results carousel <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/new">is running from today</a> (June 26) to July 30 for Premium users. However, you'll only be able to try this out on your Android or iOS mobile device.</p><p>The platform also highlighted that it's expanding its conversational AI test to some non-Premium users in the U.S.</p><p>Setting that aside for now, YouTube's AI search results carousel is highly reminiscent of Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-circle-to-search-ai-overviews-expands-galaxy-s25">AI Overviews</a>. Each is designed to give quick, bite-sized information to users depending on the query, as the AI can't fulfill everything with an overview. On one hand, it seems like a no-brainer that Google would bring some of its AI into YouTube, like AI Overviews. Either way, YouTube's been going down this AI road for a while now, slowly but surely.</p><p>That <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-highlights-premium-features-coversational-ai">conversational AI test</a> for Premium users kicked off late in 2023. YouTube placed a new "Ask" button alongside the thumbs up/down buttons under videos. Users would see a few suggested actions, like "Summarize the video," "tell me more about the topic," and "recommend related content." As always, users retain their ability to write their own questions about the video with the AI. YouTube has also started <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-music-premium-100-million-subscriber-celebration">venturing into AI-generated music</a>, too, for Shorts creation.</p> ]]></dc:content>

That means we're looking ahead to the upcoming Google Pixel 10 lineup, which isn't very far away. Based on rumors, leaks, and past Google launches, we're expecting the Pixel 10 series to debut this summer.</p><p>In fact, we even have an idea of the exact date for the Made by Google event for the Pixel 10 lineup. Android Central meticulously follows all the newest rumors, leaks, and official teasers so you don't have to. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Google Pixel 10</a> will launch in late August 2025, slightly later than the Pixel 9 launched in 2024.</p><p>For all the latest details and frequently asked questions about the Google Pixel 10 lineup, keep reading.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-google-pixel-10-launch-date-what-we-know"><span>Google Pixel 10 launch date: What we know</span></h2><p>Google is expected to hold a Made by Google launch event on August 20, 2025, and this is where we will see the Pixel 10 series for the first time. The actual release date for the Google Pixel 10 will be August 28, per an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/google-pixel-10-release-date" target="_blank">Android Headlines</a> leak. The full crop of phones that will be announced on August 20 includes the Google Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL, and Pixel 10 Pro Fold.</p><p>Earlier, reports indicated the Made by Google launch event would be held on August 13, 2025. This would’ve been the exact same date that Google launched the Pixel 9 one year earlier. However, newer reports claim that Google opted to push back the Made by Google event one week, giving us the August 20 estimate.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9hegvUAcXS9QDHfs3VeH6R" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-5.jpg" alt="Pixel 9 Pro XL back view against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9hegvUAcXS9QDHfs3VeH6R.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Keeping with tradition, the Google Pixel 10 will be available for preorder immediately after the event on August 20. Those preorders won’t be available until the official launch date of May 28, and in-store availability is expected to arrive on that same day. Currently, we don’t know what kind of preorder deals or promotions might be offered alongside the Pixel 10 series, but the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/the-best-google-pixel-9-deals-of-the-month">best Pixel 9 deals</a> might give us some indication of what to expect.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-faq"><span>FAQ</span></h2><h2 id="when-will-the-google-pixel-10-launch-2">When will the Google Pixel 10 launch?</h2><p>The Google Pixel 10 is expected to launch in August, with retail availability and an official release date rumored for late August. It may arrive slightly later than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9" target="_blank">Pixel 9 lineup</a> last year, which was announced on August 13, 2024, and officially released on August 22, 2024.</p><p>Last year, the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold debuted later than the rest of the Pixel 9 series. It's unclear if the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold will also follow this blueprint for the company's 2025 release.</p><p>Please note that any rumored dates are subject to change, as Google has not officially announced the date of its next Made by Google event.</p><h2 id="how-much-will-the-google-pixel-10-cost-2">How much will the Google Pixel 10 cost?</h2><p>While the official prices of the Google Pixel 10 series haven't been released, rumors point to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/new-google-pixel-10-rumor-hints-at-pricing-changes">some models getting a price change in 2025</a>. Specifically, the Pixel 10 Pro XL could get a $100 price hike, making the list price $1,199. Meanwhile, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold could see a $200 price decrease, lowering the cost to $1,599. The base-model Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro might keep their $799 and $999 price points, respectively.</p><h2 id="will-the-google-pixel-9-drop-in-price-2">Will the Google Pixel 9 drop in price?</h2><p>If we look at past Google Pixel launches as precedent, the Pixel 9 series should hang around at lower price points following the Pixel 10 launch. However, you don't need to wait for the Google Pixel 10 to come out to snag a deal on the Pixel 9. Prices are already much lower than they were at launch, for instance.</p><p>The best time to grab a great Pixel 9 deal is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-2025-early-deals-and-faq">during Amazon Prime Day</a>, which will span July 8 to 11 this year. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/my-favorite-google-pixel-9-deal-of-all-time-just-got-even-better-but-theres-a-small-problem">We're loving some of these early Prime Day Pixel 9 deals</a>, too.</p><p>Stay tuned for more Pixel 10 news, and check back during Prime Day for the top curated Pixel 9 deals.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="922e8ebb-4e6e-4e68-b8c4-26dfd7082689">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tnQGJNQVqF2XVQV4KfMbN8.jpg' alt="google pixel 9 square render"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 9</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The latest and greatest</strong></em></p><p>All eyes are on the upcoming Google Pixel 10, but don't sleep on the current Pixel 9.

Google led its email off by saying, "We're updating how Gemini interacts with some of the apps on your Android device." This "update" concerns Gemini's Apps Activity records within your Google account.</p><p>Now, whether you have it enabled or disabled, Gemini will still have access to your chosen Extensions like Phone, Messages, WhatsApp, and Utilities.</p><p>This change is set to arrive for Gemini on July 7. As the publication reiterates, Google's purpose behind the Gemini App Activity is to essentially improve its services, as well as the AI, from top to bottom. This includes personalizing Google products (as you'd expect). Your chats with Gemini are only kept for 72 hours, which Google says is enough time to "maintain safety and security" while also handling any feedback.</p><p>Considering Google relied on Gemini's App Activity being enabled, users couldn't use their Extensions without having their interactions catalogued. This is changing come July 7. So, if you'd like to disable Google from keeping hold of your dealings with Gemini, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://myactivity.google.com/product/gemini">you can do that</a> to prepare for this QoL (quality of life) change.</p><h2 id="a-change-that-s-meant-to-help-2">A Change that's meant to Help</h2><blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bard/comments/1ljp2uk/some_gemini_extensions_wont_require_usage_activity">Some Gemini Extensions Won't Require Usage Activity</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bard">r/Bard</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><p>The email Google has started sending out gave some quite a fright, especially when they read that Gemini will have access to their calls and texts, whether their App Activity was on or off. Moreover, Google gave no clear directions about how to disable any of this, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/gemini-apps-activity-email-july-7-3570651/">Android Authority</a> notes.</p><p>However, Google quickly cleared that air in an official statement, saying, "This update is good for users: they can now use Gemini to complete daily tasks on their mobile devices like send messages, initiate phone calls, and set timers while Gemini Apps Activity is turned off."</p><p>The company adds, "As always, users can turn off Gemini’s connection to apps at any time." This can be found by heading into Gemini's Settings <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gemini.google.com/apps">and hitting "Apps."</a> Users can freely toggle off any apps they don't want Gemini having access to that are connected to their Google Account, thus that data becomes unavailable to it.</p><p>While we await this small update, earlier this year, Google announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-gemini-app-huge-flash-thinking-model-updates-announced">a major Gemini app update</a> and a test called "personalization." Back in March, the company gave access to an experimental feature that leveraged an upgraded 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental model. Gemini could offer a more "tailored" experience by using your history in Search to help you find restaurants based on the food you typically look for.</p><p>Additionally, the 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental model is roping in even more apps to help users with complex queries that require it to look across multiple apps.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The phone's design is pretty similar to what consumers received last year with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivos-latest-foldables-make-the-galaxy-z-fold-5-look-outdated">X Fold 3 and X Fold 3 Pro</a>. Consumers are granted a 6.5-inch cover display, which blossoms into an 8-inch inner screen with 2K resolution.

Vivo states on Weibo that users can pair their Apple Watch with the X Fold 5 to receive texts, answer calls, and find their collected health data from the device in totality. Your health information recorded via the Apple Watch will be available in your Vivo Health app. Additionally, Apple's AirPods also fully work with the X Fold 5.</p><p>As previously teased during MWC Shanghai, the X Fold 5 also receives full MacOS integration, letting users view their computer files at will (if connected), use the "Extended Screen" feature, and drag-and-drop files across apps.</p><h2 id="multitasking-x-fold-5-specs-2">Multitasking & X Fold 5 Specs</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:599px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.17%;"><img id="es4vPTizjsFmPCSSwRqZeY" name="vivo-x-fold-5-white-example" alt="The Vivo X Fold 5 in white." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/es4vPTizjsFmPCSSwRqZeY.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="599" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Vivo)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:536px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:111.94%;"><img id="42jh2hBpoEsNBwhC7LEWrb" name="vivo-x-fold-5-atomic-workbench" alt="Vivo's "Atomic Workbench" (machine-translated) is a better multitasking experience for the X Fold 5." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/42jh2hBpoEsNBwhC7LEWrb.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="536" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Vivo)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Another standout feature is Vivo's new "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/1809745371/Pyct1oQFD">Big Screen Experience</a>" for the X Fold 5 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/06/25/vivo-x-fold-5-launch-dust-apple-watch/">9to5Google</a>). Its Weibo post has been machine-translated, which dubs the feature "Atomic Workbench." In short, this is a new multi-tasking mode that can reportedly let users run "up to five applications simultaneously." Users will find file transfer support across these apps via dragging and dropping.</p><p>The rest of the X Fold 5 specs include a triple 50MP camera setup in its circular camera array. This is yet another similarity to the Fold 3. The internal and cover displays offer a 20MP selfie camera. Vivo details its resistances, stating the foldable has received IPX8 and IPX9 ratings for water resistance, as well as IP5X dust resistance.</p><p>Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 SoC powers many of its functions. The X Fold 5 packs the following RAM/storage configs: 12/256GB, 12/512GB, 16/512GB, 16/1TB.</p><p>There is one notable improvement with the X Fold 5, and that concerns its upgraded 6,000mAh battery. Vivo complements this with 80W wired fast charging and 40W wireless charging capabilities.</p><p>The Vivo X Fold 5 is out for pre-orders right now for 7,999 Chinese Yuan (~$1,114). Vivo hasn't said anything about a potential global release yet.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Playing VR golf games with just the controller works fine, but that extra weight and length are physical objects that deliver a sense of authenticity to your play that not only helps you get better in the game but also better in real life.</p><p>I've been playing VR games regularly since 2016, and I've tested <em>a lot</em> of VR golf clubs and other accessories since then. My collection would make some Wii collectors blush. I've noticed that my scores have drastically improved since using a golf club attachment full time, and that score dips every time I play without one. I've narrowed down the choices to just two that you need to buy for your Meta Quest 3 or Meta Quest 3S, and they're great for very different reasons.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="0f4db2d2-044e-4db3-b1b7-59c825a22091" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Get a better grip and add realistic weight with the YOGES golf club for the Meta Quest 2 and Quest 3.

While the company's Quest 2 golf controller design wasn't my favorite, the Quest 3 version hits all the right marks for success.</p><p>That all starts with the way the controller slides into the club. Grab the right Meta Quest Touch controller with the wrist strap attached, slide the strap through the hole in the bottom, fit the end of the strap into the tongue, then twist the head to tighten the fit. That feels like a lot of instructions for what amounts to an incredibly simple, yet effective design, and it takes just seconds to install.</p><p>It's a super snug fit that doesn't wobble and has zero chance of accidentally launching the controller out since it uses the built-in wrist straps to keep the controller in place. Plus, since the controller is facing up and toward you, there's no chance you'll have tracking issues when holding the club normally.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="NHCYN4SmXbna9jSQMxULPf" name="yoges-golf-club-for-meta-quest-3-02" alt="The YOGES golf club accessory for the Meta Quest 3 and Quest 3S" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NHCYN4SmXbna9jSQMxULPf.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="e9xkn4n55aeyJjvfz7sgKf" name="yoges-golf-club-for-meta-quest-3-03" alt="The YOGES golf club accessory for the Meta Quest 3 and Quest 3S" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e9xkn4n55aeyJjvfz7sgKf.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Like a few other clubs, this one has an adjustable length, allowing you to make it the length that's most comfortable for you, ranging from 51cm to 74cm long in total. Since you don't actually want to hit the floor while virtual golfing, being able to adjust the height makes this ideal for players of all ages and statures.</p><p>That also means the YOGES club doesn't just work for golf! You can shorten it and use it like a tennis racket, or set it mid-level to make it feel like a baseball bat. I'm not sure I'd play Beat Saber with it, and it's not quite short enough to feel like a ping-pong paddle, but the adjustable range makes this ideal for most club-driven sports.</p><h2 id="now-for-the-mini-golf-fans-2">Now for the mini golf fans</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="jWh4YKtDwZjbAyxVDVsStZ" name="grip-to-putter-3-with-box-and-figurines" alt="The Grip-to-Putter 3 golf club accessory for the Meta Quest 3 and Quest 3S" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jWh4YKtDwZjbAyxVDVsStZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The YOGES club can definitely be used for mini golf.

As the name implies, this is the third-generation Grip-To-Putter designed specifically for the Meta Quest 3 jointly by the folks at FormX Design and the developers of Walkabout Mini Golf, Mighty Coconut.</p><p>The club gets its name from the grip-to-putt function found inside Walkabout Mini Golf. When that option is enabled, your putter is transparent until you hold the grip button on the controller. This works fine when you're just using a controller without a club, but it's impossible to somehow hold the grip button at the end of a golf club while you swing it. That is, unless you use the Grip-To-Putter 3, of course.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9X8naB4XMqfGEenYpeVisZ" name="grip-to-putter-3-holding-01" alt="The Grip-to-Putter 3 golf club accessory for the Meta Quest 3 and Quest 3S" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9X8naB4XMqfGEenYpeVisZ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="K7SkWAcQTDPwPFZJ4MUQtZ" name="grip-to-putter-3-holding-02" alt="The Grip-to-Putter 3 golf club accessory for the Meta Quest 3 and Quest 3S" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/K7SkWAcQTDPwPFZJ4MUQtZ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="i4EgPdU4CiTiGCLu4pNwtZ" name="grip-to-putter-3-holding-03" alt="The Grip-to-Putter 3 golf club accessory for the Meta Quest 3 and Quest 3S" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/i4EgPdU4CiTiGCLu4pNwtZ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>An ingenious trigger on the handle is connected to a cable that runs the length of the club, ending at a little plastic grip "finger" that holds the grip button when you press the trigger on the handle.</p><p>This allows you to get the advantages of the real weight of a club — and let me tell you, this club feels <em>exactly</em> like a real mini golf club, weight, grippy handle, and all — plus the advantage of the grip-to-putt option.

This also rings true for gaming devices, as we're not just relegated to either Game Boy or Switch clones. In recent months, a few more clamshell devices have arrived, such as the Anbernic RG34XXSP, which attempts to capture the magic of the Game Boy Advance SP.</p><p>What makes a clamshell handheld so enticing isn't the performance, but simply the fact that there's a lid. Just this year, the Miyoo Flip, Retroid Pocket 2 Flip, and Anbernic RG34XXSP have been released, and most of the time, you can find a deal or two. For example, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/RG34XXSP-Clamshell-Portable-Handheld-Rechargable/dp/B0F9DZ4LML/" target="_blank"><strong>the RG34XXSP is down to $85.99</strong></a> over at Amazon, a savings of almost 15%.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="3c612324-72bf-407f-9924-fc01e30254fd" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="This clamshell retro handheld is perfect for taking with you anywhere and playing your favorite retro games.

And if that's still out of your price range, the Powkiddy V90S was <em>just</em> released, and is already on Amazon <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Handheld-Foldable-3-5-Inch-Portable-Consoles/dp/B0FCXZR5CN/" target="_blank">for around $50</a>.</p><p>Unlike the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/heres-why-im-getting-the-retroid-pocket-flip-2-and-the-pocket-classic">Retroid Pocket Flip 2</a>, neither of these is running Android. Instead, you'll find a custom build of Linux from either Anbernic or Miyoo that acts as the gateway for all of your games.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="rWTtwj2cD2w63NxeLjaw4j" name="anbernic-rg34xxsp-gba-sp-anbernic-rg35xxsp-2" alt="Anbernic RG34XXSP next to RG35XXSP with Game Boy Advance SP and Miyoo Flip in background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rWTtwj2cD2w63NxeLjaw4j.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>However, there's a world of custom firmware out there, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://knulli.org/">KNULLI</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://muos.dev/">muOS</a>, that turn things up a notch. Though, unless you really have a hankering for tinkering, the stock firmware with the RG34XXSP is going to be just fine.</p><p>Right off the bat, the RG34XXSP is an excellent clone of the Game Boy Advance SP. The hinge is nice and sturdy, the controls are on point, and while a bit small for some, the 3.4-inch display is still crisp.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="AEserKQ6fu8zhyH2iJq8Aj" name="anbernic-rg34xxsp-gba-sp-anbernic-rg35xxsp" alt="Game Boy Advance SP with Anbernic RG34XXSP and RG35XXSP" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AEserKQ6fu8zhyH2iJq8Aj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Speaking of controls, that's what really sold me on the RG34XXSP. While I absolutely adored my RG35XXSP, I slowly moved away from using it as some games just don't play nicely with emulating joysticks with a D-pad.</p><p>With the RG34XXSP, that's not an issue, as this handheld has dual sticks below the rest of the controls. So as long as everything is mapped correctly in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-emulators-android">RetroArch</a>, I can fire up a PS1 game and just start playing.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="MsRdeL9HA6t74ie22eKd8j" name="anbernic-rg34xxsp-retroid-pocket-flip-2-ayaneo-pocket-dmg" alt="Anbernic RG34XXSP with AYANEO Pocket DMG and Retroid Pocket Flip 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MsRdeL9HA6t74ie22eKd8j.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Despite all of that, you might be asking yourself why I would bother even considering the RG34XXSP with a variety of more powerful hardware at my disposal? For one, I mentally categorize the types of games I plan to play on different handheld devices.</p><p>The RG34XXSP lets me play almost anything up to N64 and Dreamcast, so that's where games like Pokémon or other classics largely reside. My <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">Android handhelds</a> are where I do a lot of tinkering, such as trying to get different Windows games up and running via Winlator or GameHub. Then, my various x86 handhelds are home to anything that can't run on any of the devices.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="RMdKM6j3oyrN53cp5pxj9j" name="anbernic-rg34xxsp-retroid-pocket-flip-2-anbernic-rg557" alt="Anbernic RG34XXSP playing Pokemon Ruby surrounded by Retroid Pocket Flip 2 and Anbernic RG557" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RMdKM6j3oyrN53cp5pxj9j.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The other reason I'm a big fan of the RG34XXSP is that I can simply toss it in my pocket without worrying about a case or a screen protector. Now, I don't know if it can endure the type of punishment the GBA SP can, but so far, it's held up pretty darn nicely.</p><p>I can jump into a game when I have a few minutes, close the lid, and be on my merry way. Then, just flip the lid back open, wait a second or two, and the game will pick up right where I left off.</p><p>Lastly, the barrier of entry for the majority of these retro handhelds is pretty low. They're comparatively inexpensive, come in a variety of form factors, and are easy to recommend to practically anyone. Throw in a solid discount, and you've got a device that can provide hours of fun for you or anyone else.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Companies talked about products like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.onearmy.earth/project/phonebloks" target="_blank">Phoneblocks</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170821151058/http://atap.google.com/ara" target="_blank">Project Ara</a>, and we <em>really</em> liked what we were hearing. They were phones that were user-configurable; you decided things like which processor to use, how much memory, what camera lenses, and so on.</p><p>What made them a cool idea was that you could also swap those parts out and change them later. Think of building a custom computer and deciding what parts you want, then upgrading one of them a while later.</p><p>That never materialized and frankly, was never going to be feasible. Phones use core components that are all attached permanently to a main circuit board, and your only choice is to change the whole (expensive) board. There was never going to be a battery-powered device with swappable components that wasn't a couple of pounds in weight, and it would run so hot you could never use it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.17%;"><img id="9tKpdzr3CL8JcJpdRhjZDN" name="project-ara-promo.jpg" alt="Project Ara promo screengrab" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9tKpdzr3CL8JcJpdRhjZDN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1280" height="719" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A promo for Project Ara. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The modular name stuck, though, and like a lot of things, its definition changed. Now, when you think of a modular phone, you're talking about something that's user-serviceable; you don't need industrial tools to open and replace some of the parts that often need to be replaced.</p><p>Unlike phones at the other end of the repairability scale, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">like foldables</a>, modular phones are designed to be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-sustainable-repairable-phones">sustainable</a>. The companies that make them sell parts like a new battery or a replacement screen, and with a screwdriver and a guitar pick, you can change them yourself at your dining room table.</p><p>When you hear people talk about a modular phone, this is what they mean. Phones like the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/murena-fairphone-gen-6-announced-and-it-is-yet-again-sustainable-and-easily-repairable">Fairphone</a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/hmd-skyline-offers-something-other-phones-dont">HMD Skyline</a> are built with the idea that you can change the parts that tend to break or wear out, allowing you to keep using them longer. Combined with the software support <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/fairphone-2-getting-last-update">we see from some companies</a>, you could use a phone for six or seven years.</p><h2 id="this-meaning-of-modular-is-a-lot-better-2">This meaning of modular is a lot better</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:936px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="2jy7v7kwrFBn2XHfRL9pHk" name="Fairphone-6-internals" alt="The Fairphone 6 internals" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2jy7v7kwrFBn2XHfRL9pHk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="936" height="527" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Fairphone 6. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Fairphone)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I admit the idea of upgrading the chip inside your phone next year when newer and more powerful versions come out is way cool. It's also impossible. What we have is almost as good, and in some ways, even better.</p><p>You're probably going to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-2025-early-deals-and-faq">buy a new phone this year</a> or next. It's what we do and what we have learned to do. No matter how much we like what we already have, it will wear out or simply be set aside so something newer and "better" can replace it.</p><p>What if you could keep the phone you loved when you bought it running the very same way for years? That's what "modular" offers. If you get clumsy and bust the screen, you buy a new screen and replace it. When the battery wears out, you pop a brand-new one in. Even parts like camera lenses or USB ports have been designed to be replaced on some phones without buying a whole new set of guts to drop in.</p><p>New stuff will still be tempting, partially because the companies making it will tell us how much better it is than what you're holding right now. But knowing exactly what to expect and being able to keep it that way is great. Some things simply don't have to be disposable.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QV8hKnaBseJkkdHoMhmtQ3" name="fairphone 5 lifestyle.jpg" alt="Fairphone 5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QV8hKnaBseJkkdHoMhmtQ3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Fairphone)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you're not the right person when it comes to holding a screwdriver, modular means low repair costs, too.

One that looks like the person recording is right next to your favorite artist or band, except they're really in the upper decks. The unsung hero making all these impressive shots and recordings possible is the modern telephoto lens on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best smartphones</a>.</p><p>Telephoto lenses utilize specialized camera hardware to provide optical zoom — in other words, they can zoom in without compromising image quality. A more common form of smartphone zoom is digital zoom, which is lossy. It's like when you zoom into a photo you've already taken and it starts to get grainy and noisy. For this reason, telephoto lenses are preferred, but they aren't ubiquitous on all smartphones yet.</p><p>I used a phone with a telephoto lens for two years before switching to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge</a>, which doesn't include one for the sake of thinness. After testing phones like the iPhone 16 Pro, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Samsung Galaxy S25</a> — all of which included telephoto cameras — I expected to miss it a lot. To find out just how much, I took my Galaxy S25 Edge to a concert, and here's how it went.</p><h2 id="the-galaxy-s25-edge-has-passable-zoom-capabilities-to-a-point-2">The Galaxy S25 Edge has passable zoom capabilities... to a point</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CoozfCZjnHhMrYZN66rw4Z" name="Galaxy-S25-Edge-Silver-Back-Camera-Lenses-10" alt="Dual cameras on the Galaxy S25 Edge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CoozfCZjnHhMrYZN66rw4Z.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I took the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge to a few events at MetLife Stadium, including a concert and a FIFA Club World Cup match. Usually, I'd have a phone with a telephoto lens with me, but I only carried the Galaxy S25 Edge for these trips. That left <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-camera-review">the smartphone's main 200MP sensor and secondary 12MP ultrawide</a> as my only options for capturing content while out and about.</p><p>As it turns out, some of the criticism about the Galaxy S25 Edge not having a telephoto camera is a bit overblown. The massive 200MP, f/1.7 main camera sensor enables Samsung to utilize a handy trick called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-giant-camera-sensors-help-and-hinder-your-smartphone-photography">sensor crop</a>. Essentially, Samsung can use only part of the large 200MP sensor to capture a close-up version of the photo without sacrificing quality.</p><p>At smaller zoom lengths, like 2x or 4x zoom, you should get a high-quality image. Since 2x zoom uses only in-sensor crop, which is lossless, that means you get great shots comparable to a telephoto lens when using it. In the gallery below, the first image is captured at 1x zoom, and the second was taken with 2x zoom.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="yGpYvVK4Y8FapkFMbU3W9a" name="Galaxy-S25-Edge-Soccer-1x-Zoom" alt="A sports photo captured at 1x zoom with the Galaxy S25 Edge at MetLife Stadium." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yGpYvVK4Y8FapkFMbU3W9a.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="3000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge, 1x. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="8atDKKpj3SxgwLeEsifMHa" name="Galaxy-S25-Edge-Soccer-2x-Zoom" alt="A sports photo captured at 2x zoom with the Galaxy S25 Edge at MetLife Stadium." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8atDKKpj3SxgwLeEsifMHa.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="3000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge, 2x zoom. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>As you can see, there is no noticeable quality loss between the two photos. However, this is only applicable at really low zoom lengths. It's not as useful for concerts for that reason, because anything beyond 2x zoom is digital with AI enhancements. The results can be hit or miss.</p><p>As you can see below, there's a big dropoff between the first photo (1x zoom) and the second photo (~10x zoom). The quality loss is massive, granted, I was pretty far away.

This is true even though I zoomed in far beyond the iPhone's 5x optical zoom capabilities to grab shots of Kendrick Lamar, SZA, and DJ Mustard.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="VXVpuvtUvMYMuBTFWAu7CU" name="iPhone-16-Pro-Concert-Tests-3.JPG" alt="Concert photos captured with the iPhone 16 Pro using the telephoto camera." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VXVpuvtUvMYMuBTFWAu7CU.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="3024" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1980px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:177.78%;"><img id="KALRaoD4sVu7QThpABH6fT" name="iPhone-16-Pro-Concert-Tests-2.JPG" alt="Concert photos captured with the iPhone 16 Pro using the telephoto camera." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KALRaoD4sVu7QThpABH6fT.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1980" height="3520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="SH3VYR7YSVKq2Ghj8hpa4U" name="iPhone-16-Pro-Concert-Tests-5.JPG" alt="Concert photos captured with the iPhone 16 Pro using the telephoto camera." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SH3VYR7YSVKq2Ghj8hpa4U.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="3024" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3520px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vT4yNsHeL29kuKWDFycMwT" name="iPhone-16-Pro-Concert-Tests-4.JPG" alt="Concert photos captured with the iPhone 16 Pro using the telephoto camera." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vT4yNsHeL29kuKWDFycMwT.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3520" height="1980" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>For perspective, I was sitting in the 200 level of MetLife Stadium when I took photos with the Galaxy S25 Edge.

While leaks have already spilled a bunch, a fresh batch of almost-official renders just gave us a new look of the upcoming foldables, this time showing the Fold 7 in three sharp color options. A couple of them look a lot like those once-exclusive Samsung.com finishes.</p><p>Evan Blass has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/WorkaholicDavid/status/1937739387938439436" target="_blank">shared</a> some juicy details on Substack, revealing a few colorways for the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>. We’re looking at three main shades hitting the general market, though Samsung might still keep a few exclusives up its sleeve. The colors aren’t wildly different from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, but how they’re being rolled out definitely feels like a bit of a shuffle.</p><p>There's a luxe blue that exudes luxury, a flashy silver for those seeking a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">standout foldable</a>, and a classic black for those seeking a more subdued look.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1226px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:76.67%;"><img id="bvEXxGvhPMqJsKnAHubrxn" name="Galaxy-Z-Fold-7-leaked-renders" alt="Galaxy Z Fold 7 leaked renders in blue, silver and black" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bvEXxGvhPMqJsKnAHubrxn.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1226" height="940" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @WorkaholicDavid / X)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="exclusive-no-more-2">Exclusive no more?</h2><p>Interestingly, last year’s Z Fold 6 came in slick shades like Crafted Black and white, but only if you bought directly from Samsung's store. Now, if these new Z Fold 7 renders are showing the standard lineup and not just future site-only options, it looks like Samsung is changing its play. Those once-exclusive colors might’ve been subtly reworked and are now going mainstream.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Bt78ezw2tapN53RqwJY2TU" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Fold-6-all-colors-02.jpg" alt="Hands-on with the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Bt78ezw2tapN53RqwJY2TU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The new leak corroborates Blass’s earlier scoop on the Z Fold 7’s color lineup, which was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-may-have-accidentally-leaked-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-colors">spotted on Samsung’s Irish staging site</a>. Blass had already mentioned Blue Shadow and Jet Black as confirmed shades, and it looks like there’s a third in the mix: Silver Shadow, according to the leaked pricing pages.</p><p>It’s worth pointing out that while these early product pages help confirm the color options, they’re packed with placeholder info recycled from older launches. Still, they do make one thing clear: the main color choices seem locked in. And as a bonus detail, both the Z Fold 7 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Z Flip 7</a> are getting a Green Mint color exclusive via Samsung.com.</p><p>This wouldn’t be the first time Samsung saves the eye-catching colors for its own shop. The ones we’ve seen so far get the job done, but they’re not exactly pushing the envelope.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming smartwatch, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p> ]]></dc:content>

This means that there may be other minor issues that weren't mentioned in this summary.

Gone are the beautiful curves that made phones nice to hold and, in their place, are flat, hard edges that are fundamentally boring and uninspired.</p><p>Because of that, I've started branching out, trying some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-cases">best Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra cases</a>, and I've settled on two winners that do something unique and powerful to the phone's design.</p><p>One is ultra-minimalist, with nary a frame or back covering. Just two pieces of "Aerospace-grade aluminum" that protect your phone from the edges that hit first when you drop it. The other is a more traditional case design that doesn't look special at first, but three NFC keys on the side let you customize physical buttons to do nearly anything you'd like on the phone.</p><h2 id="more-functions-please-2">More functions, please</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="AJZEa7BhnLKdrYERr9DZo9" name="pitaka-pinbutton-case-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-with-phone" alt="The black and gray Pitaka PinButton case for the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AJZEa7BhnLKdrYERr9DZo9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/pitaka-Samsung-Compatible-Protective-PinButton/dp/B0DYRZNK5G/">Pitaka PinButton case</a> for the Galaxy S25 Ultra comes in two colors: black/gold or black/gray, and sports a carbon fiber pattern on the back. This isn't your typical <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/thinborne-designed-pixel-10-cases-sold-out">carbon/aramid fiber case</a>, though. It's a soft rubber-like material that's got bend to it, but isn't as flimsy as those clear TPU cases.</p><p>The inside is lined with a soft, felt-like material to protect your precious phone against scratches while it's in the case. It even features MagSafe magnets, allowing you to utilize the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phone-users">best MagSafe accessories</a>.</p><p>And don't worry, I made sure to test S Pen functionality while using the case with a MagSafe accessory so you won't run into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-ultra-s-pen-magsafe-qi2-malfunction">the S24 Ultra MagSafe debacle</a>.

draw of this case is that triple-button setup on the left side. Each of these buttons works by activating an NFC tag when pressed, allowing you to map that tag to any function supported by Samsung's Routines and Modes feature.</p><p>I immediately configured one of the keys to open <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> since I prefer to have the power button act as an actual <em>power button</em>. This essentially brings back the awesome side key feature <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-change-side-key-function-your-samsung-galaxy-s-or-note-phone">from the Galaxy S20 days</a> without the silly restrictions Samsung placed on it. I set the other two buttons to flashlight on and off, but you might be more creative with those functions than I am.</p><p>The case features a small lip that fits a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-screen-protectors">Galaxy S25 Ultra screen protector</a> quite nicely, but isn't tall enough to make navigation gestures annoying or uncomfortable to use. The one downside to this case is that the back is a bit of a fingerprint magnet. It's not quite like those shiny plastic cases, but the black case I have clearly shows finger grease. Thankfully, it's easy to wipe off.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="06cd7bfd-55f0-4b2c-b1b5-952394b6aecd" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="The look of aramid fiber, the protection of a dual-layer case, and the customization brought on by three NFC buttons on the side make this the ultimate Galaxy S25 Ultra case for folks who want the most out of their phone." data-dimension48="The look of aramid fiber, the protection of a dual-layer case, and the customization brought on by three NFC buttons on the side make this the ultimate Galaxy S25 Ultra case for folks who want the most out of their phone." data-dimension25="$69.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DRTXY41S/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:934px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:160.60%;"><img id="P86feJXH8uZ9UjZLqef5AG" name="pitaka-pinbutton-case-render-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P86feJXH8uZ9UjZLqef5AG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="934" height="1500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>The look of aramid fiber, the protection of a dual-layer case, and the customization brought on by three NFC buttons on the side make this the ultimate Galaxy S25 Ultra case for folks who want the most out of their phone.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DRTXY41S/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="06cd7bfd-55f0-4b2c-b1b5-952394b6aecd" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="The look of aramid fiber, the protection of a dual-layer case, and the customization brought on by three NFC buttons on the side make this the ultimate Galaxy S25 Ultra case for folks who want the most out of their phone." data-dimension48="The look of aramid fiber, the protection of a dual-layer case, and the customization brought on by three NFC buttons on the side make this the ultimate Galaxy S25 Ultra case for folks who want the most out of their phone." data-dimension25="$69.99">View Deal</a></p></div><h2 id="shiny-and-safe-2">Shiny and safe</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="7y9HutWTVdMdotEKptJ7db" name="arc-pulse-case-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-back-top" alt="The Aluminum Graphite Arc Pulse case for the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7y9HutWTVdMdotEKptJ7db.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When it comes to cases, the words "minimalist" and "safe" don't usually go together.

Its shiny "Aerospace-grade aluminum" construction is buffered by a rubberized elastomer material on the inside that keeps your phone from getting scratched up by the metal case itself, all designed to keep the look and feel of your phone as close to caseless as possible while still providing surprisingly good drop protection.</p><p>There's little chance of finding a shinier phone case, and the company offers four different style options: Aluminum Graphite, Matte Black, Rose Bronze, and Aluminum Silver.

Fortunately, Samsung is offering up to $500 of instant trade-in credit through its site, or you can skip the trade-in process and get a straight $250 knocked off your purchase. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/galaxy-books/galaxy-book5-series/buy/galaxy-book5-pro-360-16-intel-core-ultra-7-1tb-gray-np960qha-kg1us/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="ba829629-6fc2-4194-9919-71dc922ea2d8" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,699.99" data-dimension48="$1,699.99">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want to experience one of the best Samsung laptops ever built, with a sleek, convertible design, a gorgeous touchscreen display, and long battery life; you basically want a powerful laptop and portable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablet</a> all rolled into one. </p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you don&apos;t want to spend over $1,000 on a laptop; you&apos;d rather see what laptop deals Amazon Prime Day (July 8-11) is going to offer. </p><p>For starters, it&apos;s worth emphasizing just how great the Galaxy Book 5 Pro 360 really is. Wanting to experience the convenience of a convertible laptop myself, I personally switched to the 360 from my MacBook Pro last year and never looked back. </p><p>The device boasts an ultra-lightweight and thin design — like as thin as some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> — with a stunning 16-inch AMOLED touchscreen display and surprising number of ports, while under the hood you&apos;ll enjoy the powerful Intel Core 7 Ultra processor and 16GB of RAM. This premium model also features a large 76WHr battery, Quad Dolby Atmos speakers, and 1TB of storage, all while clocking in at under four pounds. </p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1676px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="iQXUk3MmNJ8cyTGEwDD4DC" name="samsung-galaxy-book-5-pro-360-official-169.jpg" alt="Galaxy Book 5 Pro 360 laptop" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iQXUk3MmNJ8cyTGEwDD4DC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1676" height="943" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Still, even if you get the max credit, the Galaxy Book 5 Pro 360 will still set you back over $1,000, so you&apos;ll be forgiven for wondering what kind of Prime Day deals we can expect to see next month. According to my price tracking tools, the laptop has never fallen below $1,444 at Amazon, and while it could dip further during Prime Day, I doubt that the price of the Galaxy Book 5 Pro 360 will drop much further than $1,199.99 during the sale.</p><p>You&apos;ll also lose out on some of the extra benefits that Samsung includes with its deals. For example, buying the laptop through Samsung right now will land you a <strong>47% discount on the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro</strong> when you bundle your purchase, plus six months of SiriusXM streaming for free (a $59.94 value).</p><p>In conclusion, I&apos;d say that if you have the cash and you want a premium Samsung laptop today, you can rest easy knowing that you made a good purchase with this deal. If the purchase isn&apos;t urgent, however, or you think you could settle for something cheaper (like one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">best Chromebooks</a>, for instance), go ahead and wait for Prime Day. After all, you never know what kind of discounts Amazon has in store.</p> ]]></dc:content>

All signs point to a pretty seamless cross-device setup in the works.</p><p>Adding to the buzz, earlier findings <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-cross-device-services-spotted-android">tied to an “App Cast” feature</a> hint at being able to stream entire apps straight from one Android device to another.

But last year, things started to scale up. Now, it looks like Google is ready to take it further, building on that groundwork with a smarter Handoff setup.</p><p>If Google pulls this off, Android users could jump between devices without missing a beat: start something on your phone or pick it up on your tablet or Chromebook. It’s a big step toward making all your devices feel like one connected system.</p><h2 id="multi-device-flow-might-soon-feel-seamless-2">Multi-device flow might soon feel seamless</h2><p>At present, Android users mostly depend on third-party apps or brand-specific tricks to sync things between devices, and they rarely feel truly seamless.</p><p>This upcoming feature goes way beyond basic file sharing. It’s built to sync your whole Android experience across devices.</p><p>Samsung already offers something similar with its App Continuity on Galaxy devices—even letting you move calls between them—but it still doesn’t quite match the polish of Apple’s Handoff. The big twist? Apple skips syncing notifications, and that’s exactly where Android’s upcoming feature could take the lead.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The South Korean publication cites a "comprehensive report" that states Qualcomm is beginning its early production tests for the Snapdragon 8 Elite 2; however, there's a version based on Samsung's 2nm process.</p><p>Judging <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.businesspost.co.kr/BP?command=article_view&num=400570">by its insights</a>, this SD 8 Elite Gen 2 variant developed by Samsung Foundry is likely intended to be the "For Galaxy" SoC in the Galaxy S26 series. Sources allege that testing is "underway" and mass production is scheduled to be completed in "the second half of this year."</p><p>The publication itself voices speculation around this, considering Samsung's head of foundry, Han Jin-man, is still in the process of receiving a green light to push ahead with this 2nm process SD 8 Elite Gen 2. However, there's apparently hope as Samsung's 2nm production yield is ~30% during its early stages. It's expected to cross the ~60% yield threshold later this year.</p><p>While Samsung could make a true "For Galaxy" chip for the S26 series, Qualcomm is reportedly sticking with TSMC for another 3nm Snapdragon 8 Elite chip. There are likely upgrades aplenty in this Elite successor, but the underlying process is seemingly on tap to remain the same.</p><h2 id="2nm-process-you-say-2">2nm process, you say?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3119px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="4hnGrXi7RNiCDVNDbUMJ2L" name="samsung-galaxy-25-qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy" alt="Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy at Samsung Unpacked 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4hnGrXi7RNiCDVNDbUMJ2L.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3119" height="1755" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-2nm-process-production-plans">laid out its plans</a> to produce better chips for phones back in 2023, and it seems those ambitions are starting to come together. To quickly summarize, Samsung said it wanted to begin producing 2nm chips by 2025 before leaning into the 1.4nm process by 2027. Considering these rumors about a 2nm-specific Snapdragon 8 Elite 2 chip "For Galaxy," that might come to pass.</p><p>Elsewhere, Qualcomm looking into Samsung for a 2nm developed chip <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-tsmc-qualcomm-2nm-chip">takes us back to rumors about the two companies</a> working together from 2024. At the time, the Korean OEM said its 2nm process in development improves performance by 12% and power efficiency by 25%. Qualcomm also reportedly contacted TSMC to do the same (a 2nm process). However, these rumors suggest TSMC is sticking with its 3nm for another Elite round.</p><p>Galaxy S26 rumors have been sparse for the most part, though <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">there are some rumors to highlight</a>, like improved cameras and a thinner Ultra. What should be noted is that Samsung could feature its next Exynos chip "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/early-rumors-galaxy-s26-exynos-change">significantly</a>" across its Galaxy S26 series.

The publication reports that this in-browser version leverages a "custom version" of Gemini 2.5 within this Chrome test. From the address bar, Google was spotted testing an "@aimode" shortcut from <strong>Settings > Search Engine > Manage Search Engines > Site Search</strong>. According to its evidence, this is supposed to open Chrome's address bar dropdown menu, which displays all available shortcuts.</p><p>From there, users will be able to hit their Tab or Spacebar keys to lock in the AI Mode function. This will create a special side-section, marked by Search's magnifying glass and Google's standard AI star.</p><p>You can type your query as you would if you were searching for something, and then hit enter.

Originally, Chrome on desktop had three choices: @history, @bookmarks, and @tabs. Each of these lets users search one of these categories with keywords, instead of diving directly into them, taking up time as a result. Moreover, Google introduces custom site shortcuts, which let users search for YouTube videos (for example) without heading there first.</p><p>This feature in Chrome on desktop has remained relatively quiet. In Google's big AI push for the browser, Chrome picked up an "@gemini" function, which lets users ask their query and be taken to Gemini's web app for the answer, just like what we're seeing with AI Mode's test.</p><p>There's no telling when this feature could arrive, considering it's only been spotted in Chrome Canary, its test environment.</p><p>After <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/geminis-ai-mode-opens-up-to-more-people-with-new-features">opening AI Mode up</a> to more users, I/O 2025 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/ai-mode-levels-up-with-new-ai-features-stealing-google-searchs-spotlight">held even more convenient, supercharged</a> surprises for the feature.

As such, these two smartphones are aimed at very different market segments and don't share much in common, be it hardware, software, or price. However, both are well-rounded products that pack tremendous value for money.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 offers everything you'd expect from a top-tier flagship, including powerhouse internals, fabulous AI-powered features, and a compact form factor. On the other hand, the Motorola Edge 2025 is a balanced mid-ranger that comes with a durable design, great battery life, and solid cameras. That's all well and good, but which of these two devices is better suited for your requirements?</p><p>Find out, as we see how Motorola Edge 2025 vs. Samsung Galaxy S25 stack up against each other.</p><h2 id="motorola-edge-2025-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-design-display-and-hardware-2">Motorola Edge 2025 vs. Samsung Galaxy S25: Design, display, and hardware</h2><p>Over the last few years, Motorola and Samsung have been fairly consistent with the overall design language of their smartphones, so it's no surprise that the Edge 2025 and the Galaxy S25 look largely identical to their respective predecessors. That being said, both look and feel equally premium, with the Motorola Edge 2025 having a textured vegan leather back, and the Samsung Galaxy S25 featuring a smooth glass rear. While both smartphones have ingress protection, the IP68/IP69 rating of the Motorola Edge 2025 makes it a bit tougher than the Samsung Galaxy S25, which only comes with an IP68 certification.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4bssY3WGBM89e24mAu539M" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-5" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy S25 outdoors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4bssY3WGBM89e24mAu539M.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Up front, the Edge 2025 sports a 6.7-inch curved P-OLED panel that's shielded by Gorilla Glass 7i and can hit a peak brightness of 4,500 nits. With the Galaxy S25, you get a 6.2-inch flat Dynamic AMOLED screen that's secured by Gorilla Glass Victus 2 and can reach a peak brightness of 2,600 nits. Needless to say, both are fantastic displays having vibrant colors, 120Hz refresh rate, full HDR support, and much more.</p><p>Arguably the biggest visual difference between the two smartphones is their physical footprint. While the Motorola Edge 2025 isn't exactly unwieldy, it can't be used with one hand. Conversely, the Samsung Galaxy S25 is purpose-built for one-handed use, and is easily the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-small-android-phone">best small Android phone</a> currently available in the market.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ms9nJVnkvpq6X9HkQ9phmC" name="Motorola-Edge-2025-home-screen-04" alt="The home screen of the Motorola Edge 2025 in its default configuration" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ms9nJVnkvpq6X9HkQ9phmC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Powering the Edge 2025 is a MediaTek Dimensity 7400 chipset, along with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage. These specifications are sufficient for everyday usage, but as Android Central's Nicholas Sutrich noted in his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-edge-2025-review">Motorola Edge 2025 review</a>, the phone struggles quite a bit when it comes to resource-intensive tasks like gaming.</p><p>Then there's the Galaxy S25, which is driven by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC, along with 12GB of RAM and at least 128GB of onboard storage. Unsurprisingly, these specifications allow the phone to make quick work of just about anything you throw at it.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Motorola Edge 2025</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy S25</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>161.2 x 73.1 x 8.0 mm</p></td><td  ><p>146.9 x 70.5 x 7.2 mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Durability & Material(s)</p></td><td  ><p>Corning Gorilla Glass 7i (Front), Vegan Leather (Back), IP68/69 certification</p></td><td  ><p>Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 (Front & Back), IP68 certification</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>181g</p></td><td  ><p>162g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.7-inch pOLED, 1220x2712 pixels resolution, 120Hz refresh rate, 4500 nits peak brightness</p></td><td  ><p>6.2-inch Dynamic AMOLED, 1080x2340 pixels resolution, 120Hz refresh rate, 2600 nits peak brightness</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Chipset / SoC</p></td><td  ><p>MediaTek Dimensity 7400</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM & Storage</p></td><td  ><p>8GB & 256GB</p></td><td  ><p>12GB & 256GB/512GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Sensors</p></td><td  ><p>Fingerprint reader (under display, optical), Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Proximity, Ambient Light</p></td><td  ><p>Fingerprint reader (under display, ultrasonic), Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Proximity, Ambient Light</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.4, Dual-SIM 5G, NFC, and USB-C</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, Dual-SIM 5G, NFC, and USB-C</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Other Features</p></td><td  ><p>Stereo speakers, Smart Connect</p></td><td  ><p>Stereo speakers, DeX (wired & wireless)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery & Charging</p></td><td  ><p>5,200mAh, 68W wired charging, 15W wireless charging</p></td><td  ><p>4,000mAh, 25W wired charging, 15W wireless charging</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Cameras (Rear)</p></td><td  ><p>50MP (wide-angle), 10MP (telephoto with 3x optical zoom), 50MP (ultrawide), OIS, 4K video recording</p></td><td  ><p>50MP (wide-angle), 10MP (telephoto with 3x optical zoom), 12MP (ultrawide), OIS, 8K video recording</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Camera (Front)</p></td><td  ><p>50MP (wide-angle), 4K video recording</p></td><td  ><p>12MP (wide-angle), 4K video recording</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS & Update Policy</p></td><td  ><p>Android 15 (preinstalled), 2 years of OS and 3 years of security updates</p></td><td  ><p>Android 15 (preinstalled), 7 years of OS and 7 years of security updates</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Color Options</p></td><td  ><p>Deep Forest</p></td><td  ><p>Standard: Navy, Mint, Icy Blue, Silver Shadow | Online Exclusive: Blueblack, Coralred, Pinkgold</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Both smartphones have all the essentials such as Wi-Fi 6E/7, Bluetooth 5.4, multi-band 5G support, NFC, and stereo speakers. You also get under-display fingerprint sensors on both devices, although the Galaxy S25's ultrasonic sensor is going to be a bit faster than the Edge 2025's optical sensor.</p><h2 id="motorola-edge-2025-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-software-cameras-and-battery-2">Motorola Edge 2025 vs. Samsung Galaxy S25: Software, cameras, and battery</h2><p>Even though both smartphones run Android 15 out of the box, there's a substantial difference in their software experience. The Edge 2025 comes with Motorola's Hello UI overlay, which adds several nifty features (e.g., Smart Connect), while still keeping the overall appearance largely the same as stock Android. With the Galaxy S25, you get Samsung's One UI 7 overlay, which has its own set of useful features (e.g., Wireless DeX), but doesn't even remotely resemble stock Android.</p><p>And since you just can't have a smartphone these days without some AI thrown into the mix, each device comes with its own suite of AI-powered tools. The Edge 2025 packs Motorla's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a>, with features like summarization of calls and messages, and playlist generation. Similarly, the Galaxy S25 includes Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>, with features such as cross-app actions, personalized briefings, and real-time language translation. You also get Google's Gemini and a whole bunch of editing applications on both of these smartphones.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kDPQii4aTrhqUirQqrNpZ7" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-4" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy S25 outdoors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kDPQii4aTrhqUirQqrNpZ7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While the software experience is comparably good on both devices, the same isn't true when it comes to software support. Slated to receive just two years of OS and three years of security updates, the Edge 2025 is not even in the same ballpark as the Galaxy S25, which will receive seven years of OS and security updates. Granted, it's not a top-of-the-line device like the Galaxy S25, but when you can get so many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">cheap Android phones</a> with better update commitments, there's no reason for the Edge 2025 to have such abysmal software support.</p><p>Talking about cameras, both smartphones pack similar triple-lens rear camera systems, complete with features like OIS and high-resolution video recording. The camera setups on both devices include a primary wide-angle sensor, a telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom, and an ultrawide module. The Galaxy S25 is expected to capture awesome photos, considering the fact that it's a top-tier phone. However, it's the Edge 2025 that punches above its weight, delivering incredible images in all kinds of lighting conditions.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="TqiPPWpQCfakWUpSzosNeN" name="Motorola-Edge-2025-back-04" alt="The vegan leather back of the forest green Motorola Edge 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TqiPPWpQCfakWUpSzosNeN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Although the Galaxy S25 only has a 4,000mAh battery due to its small size, don't let that fool you. As noted by Android Central's Brady Snyder in his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 review</a>, the phone can hit more than six hours of screen-on time with mixed usage. Wired charging remains disappointingly slow at 25W, and you also get 15W wireless charging support.</p><p>On the other hand, the Edge 2025 comes with a 5,200mAh battery that lets you use the phone throughout the day. The blazing-fast 68W wired charging means you only need to wait a few minutes for a top-up, and there's support for 15W wireless charging as well.</p><h2 id="motorola-edge-2025-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-which-should-you-buy-2">Motorola Edge 2025 vs. Samsung Galaxy S25: Which should you buy?</h2><p>Whether you go for the Motorola Edge 2025 or the Samsung Galaxy S25, there's no denying that you'll be getting an Android device that ticks most (if not all) of the right boxes. Having a price tag of $550, the Edge 2025 features a gorgeous design and decent specifications, but the lackluster update policy doesn't do it any favors. The Galaxy S25 sports best-in-class hardware and will be supported for years to come, but with a price tag of $800, it's quite expensive. Interestingly, both have versatile software, excellent cameras, and solid battery endurance.

If you're a heavy user and hold on to your smartphone(s) for a long time, the Samsung Galaxy S25 is definitely worth it.

To kick things off, the Balance 2, which is available globally for $299, focuses on those "high performers." Those who love running daily or strength training throughout the week will have a 1.5-inch scratch-resistant Sapphire glass display. With 2,000nits of peak brightness, Amazfit says the Balance 2 will remain bright even while outside.</p><p>For training purposes, the post says the Balance 2 supports running, cycling, golf, diving, to name a few of its over 170 available workouts/sports-related activities.</p><p>However, it takes golf to another level by providing a "full in-round experience." The Balance 2 features 40,000-plus course maps, hazards, scoring, and swing feedback. Alongside this is the watch's HYROX-Optimized Training. With three available modes, the Balance 2 gives users interval planning, heart rate zones, recovery, and more. If you are running through the city, Amazfit highlights free downloadable maps for users.</p><h2 id="keeping-the-balance-2-2">Keeping the Balance (2)</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1140px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:52.63%;"><img id="QJfvFWHmyEVbZULTe33Fdi" name="amazfit-balance-2-workout-example" alt="The Amazfit Balance 2 smartwatch on a model's wrist with an orange band during a workout." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QJfvFWHmyEVbZULTe33Fdi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1140" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Amazfit)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Your workouts and sleep will benefit from the Balance 2's "enhanced" monitoring capabilities. This involves better tracking and data capture for your heart rate, HRV, blood oxygen, and more. Even divers will benefit from this <em>and </em>the watch's dedicated diving support. Amazfit states the Balance 2 fully supports freediving and scuba divers up to 45 meters, and the watch is water-resistant up to 100 meters.</p><p>After all of these features were packed into the Balance 2, Amazfit detailed one more thing: BioCharge Score. This new feature is still "coming soon;" however, it's said to become your "personalized body energy management" system. BioCharge Score will monitor your energy levels constantly throughout the day, working with your sleep data, exertion, stress, and more to help you understand if you need to rest more or make that extra push.</p><p>The smartwatch comes packed with a 21-day battery life to keep you going without worry.</p><p>As previously stated, the Balance 2 is available for $299 globally on Amazfit.com, Amazon, and "select" retailers.</p><h2 id="all-data-no-distractions-2">All data, no distractions</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:900px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="QVd63zGsqjfRp2ZP6T8xof" name="amazfit-helio-strap-workout-example" alt="The Amazfit Helio Strap in black on a model's wrist during a workout." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QVd63zGsqjfRp2ZP6T8xof.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="900" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Amazfit)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Alternatively, the Amazfit Helio Strap is the company's first screen-free tracker that focuses on gathering your health data comfortably. Available for $99, the Helio Strap is comfortable enough to wear to bed to take full advantage of its 10-day battery life. Moreover, the Helio Strap's continuous heart rate monitoring is said to deliver "high precision" data to understand training load and overall cardiovascular health.</p><p>The BioCharge Score feature that is "coming soon" for the Balance 2 is already available on the Helio Strap.</p><p>Accessible via the Zepp app, Helio Strap owners will find 27 workout modes, including cycling, walking, and yoga. Alongside this are some available Strength training and HYROX modes for tracking your reps, rest periods, and sets. Additionally, Amazfit says Helio Strap owners will have access to the exclusive HYROX Race mode.</p><p>Like the Balance 2, the Helio Strap is already available on Amazfit.com, Amazon, and "select" retailers.</p><p>It's worth reiterating that the Balance 2 and Helio Strap take your health data to another level when used simultaneously. When combined, Amazfit says its analytics systems elevate, giving you increased insight into your heart rate, fatigue, and recovery analysis. All of this is synced to your Zepp app on your phone without a necessary subscription.</p><p>So, if you're interested, Amazfit details a special combo bundle, which delivers the Balance 2 and Helio Strap for $379.</p> ]]></dc:content>

With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-june-feature-drop-pixel-widget-feature-expands-rollout">June 2025 update</a>, Google has added a new widget for the Contacts app called Pixel VIPs. It essentially lets you access all pertinent information about your favorite contacts like location, birthdays, memos, and more, with just a single tap. Pixel VIPs is compatible with only Pixel phones, from the Pixel 6 and newer.</p><p>We got this working successfully on a Pixel 6a running <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-review">Android 16</a>. If you have a compatible Pixel, make sure you update it and try out the new Pixel VIPs widget.</p><h2 id="how-to-set-up-and-add-pixel-vips-2">How to set up and add Pixel VIPs</h2><p>1. Verify that your Pixel is on the latest software version by heading to <strong>Settings</strong>, <strong>System</strong>, and scroll to <strong>Software updates</strong>.</p><p>2. Under <strong>System update</strong>, make sure it says '<strong>Updated to 5 June 2025</strong>.' If not, tap System update and let it search and install it.</p><p>3. Once updated, you should have a notification waiting which says <strong>Pixel Tips</strong>. You can tap this to see all the newly added features, the first one being Pixel VIPs. You can also open the <strong>Contacts </strong>app and head to the <strong>Highlights </strong>tab below to find it.</p><p>4. From here on, simply follow the on-screen instructions to set it up. Your favorite contacts will automatically be chosen, and you can add up to eight VIP contacts.</p><p>5. Once you've filled out all the information you need for each contact, it's time to add the widget to the home screen.</p><p>6. Use a long-press gesture on any free space on your home screen, and choose <strong>Widgets</strong>.</p><p>7. Scroll down to <strong>Contacts </strong>and the first 4x1 widget should say <strong>VIPs</strong>.</p><p>8. Simply place the widget anywhere on the home screen, adjust the size, and all your chosen VIP contacts should show up. Now, you can simply tap a name to bring up a card overlay with all the information for that particular contact.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:74.07%;"><img id="nZqTfzsn3EQJ8ms6bicQEN" name="pixel-vips-setup" alt="Pixel VIPs setup process" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nZqTfzsn3EQJ8ms6bicQEN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3240" height="2400" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Roydon Cerejo / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Note:</strong> It's possible you might not see the VIPs feature in the Contacts app at first, even after installing the June update. It happened to us, and a few others on Reddit have also complained about this issue. A quick fix would be to open the Play Store, head to Manage apps and devices, and uninstall Pixel VIPs.

This includes shortcuts for calls, messages, and WhatsApp, get alerts before major events like an upcoming birthday, keep track of the weather and the local time of your contact, and also get push-suggestions for outdoor activities that you could potentially do together. The more information you punch in, the better the personalized experience will be. This makes Pixels some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> in the market today.</p><p>Besides Pixel VIPs, the June 2025 Pixel Drop also added a fun new feature that now lets you create GenAI stickers in Gboard. This feature is only available for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a> users as it basically uses Pixel Studio to create stickers from from simple text prompts. Other additions include new accessibility features like Expressive Captions to capture the mood of what's streaming, the ability to customize preferences like the volume on hearing aids, and the addition of LE Audio for low-energy Bluetooth pairing with hearing aids.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="84adaf37-e2a9-47aa-9838-6affd32b9667">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Y6BjeqA5JUC8RJeo9rnUrA.jpg' alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 9 Pro</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The best Pixel to buy</strong></em></p><p>The Pixel 9 Pro is currently one of the best Android phones to buy.

Looking at Galaxy Watch 6 deals in 2024, Samsung eventually cut its price in half ($150) by November, before it ran out of stock.</p><p>So as great as this Watch 7 deal looks, it could dip further by the <em>official</em> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-2025-early-deals-and-faq">Amazon Prime Day 2025</a> next month, or even further by the next Prime Day in October, or Cyber Monday.

Many details about it are still a mystery, but leaked renders of the Watch 8 and Watch 8 Classic show what they could look like with a squircle face-lift.</p><p>Some people will appreciate that the Galaxy Watch 8 <em>finally</em> has a new look, since the Watch 7 isn't that different from the 2021 Watch 4 or the 2019 Watch Active 2. Others will be disappointed that the polarizing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> design has permeated into the "Classic" lineup, with a rotating bezel on top of a large square case.</p><p>While the Watch 8 will undoubtedly have upgrades over the Watch 7, we don't expect <em>core</em> changes to the display size, battery life, or charging speed. It'll take a few months longer to get new One UI 8 Watch perks, but eventually, they'll be on the same software with tools like Gemini and AI health coaching.</p><h2 id="the-main-reason-to-buy-or-skip-the-cheap-galaxy-watch-7-2">The main reason to buy (or skip) the cheap Galaxy Watch 7</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="35rjmuxKAAXurGy3xc6fPL" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-6-and-6-Classic.jpeg" alt="Close-up of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 and Watch 6 Classic" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/35rjmuxKAAXurGy3xc6fPL.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung has maintained the mainline Galaxy Watch at $299 for the last two generations, but there's no guarantee it'll stay there due to tariff considerations or natural price increases. Buying the Watch 7 now may save you <em>more</em> than $100 compared to the Watch 8.</p><p>(<strong>Update:</strong> Since I wrote this, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/new-leak-reveals-galaxy-watch-8-price-hike-and-ultra-2-costs/">WinFuture</a> claimed that, according to European retailer leaks, the Galaxy Watch 8 will cost "€40-50 more" than the Watch 7. There will be regional differences in pricing, but if the Watch 8 does cost about $350 and up, that'll make the $199 Watch 7 even more tempting!)</p><p>Some people skipped the Watch 7 and Ultra because they wanted a return to the "Classic" design. However, since the Watch 8 Classic incorporates the Ultra's design — and will likely cost nearly $500 according to the above leak. So is it worth waiting for the new generation? It depends on whether you like the new look.</p><p>The Watch 6 Classic, while stylish, never really <em>looked</em> like a normal watch, even with an analog watch face. So it's not bad that Samsung is trying to make its watches more distinct and redefine what "Classic" means; only you can decide if the new aesthetics work for you, or if you want to hold out another year for a Watch 9 redesign.</p><p>Ultimately, I'd say that the Galaxy Watch 7 sounds like a great deal right now for anyone who doesn't like where the Watch 8 lineup is trending. But if you have <em>any</em> doubts, hold out another month or two to see if the Watch 8 has any upgrades you can't live without! Then you can decide if these new perks are worth an extra $150 or more.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The company today announced Gemini CLI, an open-source AI agent that aims to upgrade your terminal while keeping security and locality at the forefront. Gemini CLI is powered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini 2.5 Pro</a> and offers a one-million-token context window — and best of all, it's free.</p><p>While <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-2-5-pro-and-flash-go-public-as-google-announces-new-flash-lite-model">the latest Gemini 2.5 Pro model</a> is at the heart of the Gemini CLI experience, its capabilities don't end there. The tool can also use Google Search to access real-time data in addition to the model's local knowledge base. It supports growing open specifications, like the Model Context Protocol (MCP), so users can add their own sources and extensions.</p><p>Since Gemini CLI works within your terminal, you can personalize it to match your current workflows and processes. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli" target="_blank">preview is fully open-source</a> , meaning it can be peer-reviewed to ensure it's secure. You would probably want to see what you're adding to your terminal before installing Gemini CLI, and Google is letting you do just that by opening it up.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VWXyY4oRTQtDThAzbawvCT" name="Gemini-CLI-Demo" alt="Gemini CLI running in a command line UI on macOS." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VWXyY4oRTQtDThAzbawvCT.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="400" height="225" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google says that Gemini CLI will add "powerful AI capabilities, from code understanding and file manipulation to command execution and dynamic troubleshooting" to your command-line interface. It'll also make it possible to "write code, debug issues and streamline your workflow with natural language" without using a separate chatbot or IDE, per the company.</p><p>Speaking of integrated development environments (IDEs), Gemini CLI is integrated with Gemini Code Assist for when you'd rather work in an app like VSCode. The two tools are sharing tricks, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/docs/use-agentic-chat-pair-programmer#before-you-begin" target="_blank">Gemini Code Assist now gets an agent mode</a> to match the functionality of Gemini CLI.

Re-released under the 8849 branding in March 2025, this rugged beast packs curious specs.</p><p>I've fiddled with projectors before and find them to be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/i-replaced-my-android-tv-with-a-smart-projector">creative replacements for TVs in cramped spaces</a>. The idea of a portable projector being as small as a phone is amazing, but the Tank 3 Pro is so heavy that it shoots itself in the foot from a portability perspective. At 694 grams, this thing weighs three times as much as the 218-gram <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>.</p><p>Is this thing worth your time and money, then?

You even get auto and manual keystone options, with a physical knob on the side to manually adjust focus and keystone settings for the projection.</p><p>What really took me by surprise was how easily I could launch and use the projector. There's no learning curve; it's a plug-and-play experience. You're essentially projecting your phone's screen, so you can watch Netflix or YouTube, play games, doomscroll social media, shop online, or do just about anything an Android phone can do, but on a larger display.</p><p>It's as easy as using the Cast feature on an Android phone, but even simpler. All I had to do was point at a wall and project my screen, allowing me to watch videos, give presentations, or browse photo galleries with friends on the go, regardless of my location.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="B4FTvig6kWBSqu7wEPuB2d" name="Unihertz 8849 Tank 3 Pro" alt="Unihertz 8849 Tank 3 Pro Android phone with projector built-in" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B4FTvig6kWBSqu7wEPuB2d.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xXpsuQBZkBJhFkNbW9Rf4d" name="Unihertz 8849 Tank 3 Pro" alt="Unihertz 8849 Tank 3 Pro Android phone with projector built-in" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xXpsuQBZkBJhFkNbW9Rf4d.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sKpm7LicjxbXnvtTuoduAd" name="Unihertz 8849 Tank 3 Pro" alt="Unihertz 8849 Tank 3 Pro Android phone with projector built-in" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sKpm7LicjxbXnvtTuoduAd.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The projected display gets shockingly big while maintaining clarity. The projected screen features a 480p resolution and can be as large as 100 inches.</p><p>I found that the picture quality looks really good for such mid-specs, with decent sharpness and vivid colors, even in a dim to dark room. It's an excellent mid-range quality projection ideal for watching videos like movies, anime, etc.</p><p>The auto keystone works superbly well. I do wish there was a mounting hole bored into the back or some sort of phone case that added compatibility with standard projector stands. The lack of one makes it quite challenging to place the phone on a platform or at a high enough angle properly to aim at a wall or screen.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="6oQVbm8jfAoNcEiKqeeaJd" name="Unihertz 8849 Tank 3 Pro" alt="Unihertz 8849 Tank 3 Pro Android phone with projector built-in" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6oQVbm8jfAoNcEiKqeeaJd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3800" height="2138" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The speaker gets quite loud, even if it's not the best quality. Thanks to Bluetooth 5.3, this is easily resolved by using a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-speakers">decent Bluetooth speaker</a> for audio instead. The phone also has Wi-Fi 6 and a 3.5mm audio jack for connectivity.</p><p>Such a feature requires a ton of power, and boy does this phone deliver. You get a massive 23,800mAh battery and there's a 120W charger included in the box. These are the two main reasons why the Tank 3 Pro is such a hefty lad.</p><div><blockquote><p>Putting this phone in your pockets is a quick way of pantsing yourself.</p></blockquote></div><p>The weight of the device is justified in this case, since it helps the phone last for a week on a single charge. Even with heavy use of the projector, you can squeeze out several days of usage.</p><p>The fun doesn't stop there. I don't know how they did it, but the Tank 3 Pro is a rugged phone with an IP68 waterproof and shockproof rating, despite having a cooling fan, a projector, extra buttons, and a gigantic flashlight. There are so many variables that could potentially interfere with waterproofing, and yet they don't.</p><p>In fact, there is a dedicated underwater use mode that allows users to navigate the phone using only buttons.</p><h2 id="custom-keys-and-sos-function-take-things-further-2">Custom keys and SOS function take things further</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3887px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="3fyyqSEKvNhUspzsig3KNd" name="Unihertz 8849 Tank 3 Pro" alt="Unihertz 8849 Tank 3 Pro Android phone with projector built-in" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3fyyqSEKvNhUspzsig3KNd.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3887" height="2186" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hFaoivzHErQCjtcmpBNdWd" name="Unihertz 8849 Tank 3 Pro" alt="Unihertz 8849 Tank 3 Pro Android phone with projector built-in" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hFaoivzHErQCjtcmpBNdWd.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3763px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="Vn4P8sg9UFrXMcumbf8Fdd" name="Unihertz 8849 Tank 3 Pro" alt="Unihertz 8849 Tank 3 Pro Android phone with projector built-in" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Vn4P8sg9UFrXMcumbf8Fdd.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3763" height="2117" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>It feels like you could have a perfect doomsday companion in the Tank 3 Pro. The phone has a projector for entertainment, plus there are handy add-ons like a multi-use toolkit, a bright camping light, and two extra mappable buttons on the side.</p><p>The campfire light gets blindingly bright, features three brightness levels, and has different modes that make the light stay still, change color, or flash. There's a multi-use toolkit with handy features, including an alarm bell, a speedometer, a magnifier, a measuring scale, and a compass. This, combined with dual-band GPS, makes it an indispensable companion for outdoor adventures with emergency situations in mind.</p><p>As for the customizable buttons, these can be set to open any app you like. There are several preset functions that can be assigned as well.</p><h2 id="my-final-thoughts-on-the-tank-3-pro-2">My final thoughts on the Tank 3 Pro</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4f6zM4LFaPfhpw9TXrJFVd" name="Unihertz 8849 Tank 3 Pro" alt="Unihertz 8849 Tank 3 Pro Android phone with projector built-in" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4f6zM4LFaPfhpw9TXrJFVd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Since there's no bloatware on this device, it's even easier to play around with the phone and learn how to use its special features and settings. Unihertz has promised three years of updates for the phone, which is comforting, seeing as it runs the outdated Android 14 out of the box. There's no bloatware either, which is unusual for a Chinese brand like Unihertz.</p><p>Other noteworthy features of the Tank 3 Pro include a Dimensity 8200 chipset, a 6.79-inch 120Hz FHD display, a 200MP main camera, a 64MP secondary camera with night vision, dual-SIM support, and expandable storage up to 2TB. And this isn't the usual trope where there's one SIM slot and another convertible SIM card slot that can only accommodate a SIM or a memory card. Unihertz was generous and added three distinct slots.</p><p>The phone's memory options are great too, with 16GB or 18GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. This can further be expanded up to 36GB by using some of the ROM as RAM temporarily, giving a performance boost when needed.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2nsvLUZ9BKTiaViqiZj2Vd" name="Unihertz 8849 Tank 3 Pro" alt="Unihertz 8849 Tank 3 Pro Android phone with projector built-in" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2nsvLUZ9BKTiaViqiZj2Vd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In the natural order of things, it all comes down to the price. The Unihertz 8849 Tank 3 Pro starts at $629.99 for the 16GB/512GB variant, while the 18GB option costs $719.99. Those are pretty steep numbers.</p><p>Compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>, this is a mid-range price. However, the market that this phone is trying to compete in is portable projectors. You can score a high-quality portable projector like the Anker Nebula Capsule 3 for about $600. The XGIMI MoGo 4 is priced at $499. You get undeniably better resolution and picture quality from such options, and I haven't even mentioned older models from these brands that are much cheaper.</p><p>Despite this, the Tank 3 Pro outperforms the portable projector competition with its massive battery. It's a unique mix of features in a very niche product. The projector is more than just a neat little party trick; it can be extremely useful for teachers or professionals, enabling them to create and show presentations on the fly. Depending on who you are, you might just find it a very convenient assortment of features inside one heavy brick of a phone.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="849bfbed-472c-4dc1-935e-f4b5d057f7f5">            <a href="https://8849tech.com/products/tank-3-pro-newly-upgraded-5g-23800mah-200mp-projection-rugged-phone" data-model-name="Unihertz 8849 Tank 3 Pro" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/szjGCjeNuFjdYwWfAF4GRA.jpg' alt="Unihertz 8849 Tank 3 Pro"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Unihertz 8849 Tank 3 Pro</div>                                <div class="stars__reviews"><span itemprop="reviewRating" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Rating" class="chunk rating"><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><meta itemprop="bestRating" content="100.0" /><meta itemprop="worstRating" content="0.0" /><meta itemprop="ratingValue" content="80" /></span></div>                </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Pocket cinema with Android</strong></em></p><p>It looks like a cheap rugged phone from a Chinese OEM, but don't shrug it off just because of that.

But at some point last year, my brain <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/we-need-smaller-flagship-android-tablets">switched things up</a> on me, and I started wanting something in between my foldable phone and laptop. Enter the Lenovo Legion Tab Gen 3, with its 8.8-inch, 165Hz display, and the fact that it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/tablets/android-tablets/lenovo-legion-tab-gen-3/zaef0068us"><strong>currently on sale for around $450</strong></a>.</p><p>Until recently, our only options for a flagship tablet meant that we had to deal with larger displays, maxing out with the 14.6-inch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review">Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra</a>. Most tablets around 11 inches and below usually meant you were going to end up with a mid-range or budget tablet, none of which offered flagship power.</p><p>That's no longer the case, as options like the Legion Tab Gen 3 have arrived here in the States. Previous iterations were only available in other regions, with Lenovo's offering falling under the Y700 branding umbrella.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="e309ddf0-8be5-42fc-bced-dd61f7943fc9" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="The Lenovo Legion Tab Gen 3 is perfect for anyone who wants a powerful and capable Android tablet without feeling the need to carry around a laptop replacement.

However, we don't yet know if it'll eventually make its way here.</p><p>Still, all of this power is housed within a slim and compact form factor, hidden behind an 8.8-inch IPS panel. Normally, this is where I would complain about the decision to forego an OLED screen, but that's not the case here. It almost feels like Lenovo stumbled upon a stockpile of the best LCD panels at this size, as the Legion Tab Gen 3 looks absolutely fantastic.</p><p>It's very similar to the screen found on previous Y700 models, which was the same panel used in the original Lenovo Legion Go. No matter what the reason, this is one of the few times that I actually don't have any problems with the decision to go with an OLED screen.</p><h2 id="go-small-or-go-home-2">Go small or go home</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="i26BrmcRAYpBgL6AhxWmVS" name="lenovo-legion-tab-gen-3-pixel-9-pro-fold-lenovo-chromebook-plus-14-1" alt="Lenovo Legion Tab Gen 3 with Chromebook Plus 14 and Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/i26BrmcRAYpBgL6AhxWmVS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are a couple of reasons why I enjoy having a powerful tablet that's smaller than my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-ipad-pro-m4-13-inch-long-term-review">iPad Pro</a> or Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra. The first is that the Legion Tab has essentially become my digital notebook, especially with a matte screen protector installed.</p><p>Oh yeah, the Legion Tab supports stylus input when paired with Lenovo's Tab Pen Plus. While there are times when a larger canvas is nice to have, it gets pretty cumbersome if you need a scratchpad by your side throughout the day.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="zSMqZ6HY8oQomiQifeEwUS" name="lenovo-legion-tab-gen-3-with-stylus" alt="Notes app with stylus on Lenovo Legion Tab Gen 3 with matte screen protector" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zSMqZ6HY8oQomiQifeEwUS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The other main reason why I enjoy having a flagship tablet at this size is the obvious one — gaming and emulation. Technically, it's possible for me to use the 14.6-inch Tab S10 Ultra with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/gamesir-g8-plus-review">GameSir G8 Plus</a>, but as you might suspect, it's beyond comical.</p><p>Instead, the Legion Tab Gen 3 is compatible with a variety of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-game-controllers-android">mobile controllers</a>, and you won't look absolutely absurd if you were to pull this out while waiting at the airport. Okay, maybe a little absurd, but nowhere near as bad as the Tab S10 Ultra.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="tQJVJ4bsWLU6f6QK4BjoWS" name="lenovo-legion-tab-gen-3-halls-of-torment-razer-kishi-ultra" alt="Lenovo Legion Tab Gen 3 playing Halls of Torment connected to Razer Kishi Ultra with other controllers in the background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tQJVJ4bsWLU6f6QK4BjoWS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="a-few-gripes-but-still-worth-every-penny-2">A few gripes, but still worth every penny</h2><p>Admittedly, this isn't the <em>perfect</em> tablet for everything I want it to do. For instance, my biggest gripe is that you're limited to just one storage configuration. Anyone who's messed around with higher-end emulation knows that won't last very long, at which point you're either transferring files back and forth, or need to rely on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/practically-all-of-the-best-android-phones-are-hindered-by-this-one-dumb-thing">portable SSD</a>.</p><p>I'm also very confused as to why Lenovo didn't include biometrics beyond "Face Unlock." It's also not the <em>good</em> version from the Pixel, meaning it's not as secure. Surely Lenovo could've spent a few pennies and embedded a fingerprint scanner in the power button. It's not a deal-breaker by any means, but more of a curious and confusing omission.</p><p>Nevertheless, the Legion Tab Gen 3 is still one of my favorite tablets of the year, and as mentioned before, you can save a few bucks. Currently, it can be had for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/tablets/android-tablets/lenovo-legion-tab-gen-3/zaef0068us"><strong>around $100 off</strong></a>, which is $50 below the expected retail price before the tariff nonsense forced OEMs to raise prices.</p> ]]></dc:content>

POCO is continuing that momentum with the debut of the standard F7. Although the device doesn't have too many similarities to the F7 Ultra, it is interesting in its own right.</p><p>The F7 is powered by the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4, which has huge performance gains over the 8s Gen 3. I enjoyed using the chipset in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/iqoo-neo-10-review">iQOO Neo 10</a>, and it is just as performant on the F7 — Nothing is also set to use it on the Phone 3. But what makes the F7 that much more enticing is the value; POCO is once again undercutting its immediate rivals, and that makes the device a downright bargain.</p><p>I used the F7 for the better part of two weeks, and if you want a mid-ranger, there really isn't anything that gives you quite as much value.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-poco-f7-pricing-and-availability"><span>POCO F7: Pricing and availability</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="XXB9HAhiTuxvkCarMLTZAQ" name="POCO F7" alt="POCO F7 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XXB9HAhiTuxvkCarMLTZAQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>POCO unveiled the F7 on June 24, and the phone is set to go on sale starting July 1. The phone is available for ₹31,999 ($372) for the 12GB/256GB model, and ₹33,999 ($395) for the edition with 12GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. It's good to see POCO providing 256GB of storage with the base model — just like last year.</p><p>Over in the U.K., the POCO F7 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mi.com/uk/product/poco-f7/buy">retails for £389</a> ($530) for the 12GB/256GB model, and £429 ($584) for the 12GB/512GB variant. If you're interested in buying the phone before July 7, you can pick up the 12GB/256GB model at £319 ($434) and the 12GB/512GB model at £359 ($488).</p><p>It will cost the equivalent of $399 for the 12GB/256GB model in other global markets, with launch pricing at $339. The 12GB/512GB model costs $449, with POCO bringing it down to $399 during the launch window.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-poco-f7-what-i-like"><span>POCO F7: What I like</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CYcDM43utUVmx2cC396m9Q" name="POCO F7" alt="POCO F7 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CYcDM43utUVmx2cC396m9Q.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>POCO doesn't shy away from bold designs, and the F7 takes this to a new level.

On that note, the phone has a huge 6,500mAh battery, and it lasts over a day and a half with medium use.

POCO did this in the past as well where it limited the bigger battery to the Indian version, and I want to see that change.</p><p>Other than that, the phone gets 90W charging, and it takes just over 44 minutes to charge the device.

You can get beautiful shots if you're willing to tweak the settings, but it isn't anywhere as effortless to use as the Pixel 9a or even the iQOO Neo 10. The 8MP wide-angle lens is strictly average, and it doesn't measure up in low-light situations. You get 4K60 video, but stabilization isn't great.</p><p>Another issue is with the software; while I generally like what POCO is doing in this area, the F7 has way too much bloatware installed out of the box.

While smartphone displays have gotten stupidly bright in the last few years, many are still difficult to see in direct sunlight.</p><p>That's where the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> comes in. While some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> have brighter displays, the Galaxy S25 Ultra turns the tables by implementing a brilliant anti-glare layer that makes it dead easy to see in the sunlight, and that's great for anyone who spends a lot of time outdoors, especially this time of year.</p><p>But not all is rosy with Samsung's latest flagship display. While the display excels in several areas, lingering problems from the Galaxy S24 Ultra haven't been properly addressed. Let's take a deeper dive into what makes the Galaxy S25 Ultra so good to use outside and why it's a little tougher to enjoy indoors.</p><p>And with Prime Day right around the corner, be sure to check out some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-deals-of-the-month">Galaxy S25 Ultra deals</a> ↓, as some pretty hot ones are already live.</p><h2 id="comfort-is-key-2">Comfort is key</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="PMGmZoK3rZwMt7WQ59uTKB" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-ui-lockscreen-widgets-neon" alt="A Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra with a widget-covered lockscreen on a rainy neon-soaked street" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PMGmZoK3rZwMt7WQ59uTKB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In the modern era, all flagship phone displays look good. This applies to most phone specs these days, from performance to camera quality, which means differentiating products usually comes down to one or two categories that a product is strongest in.</p><p>Most display reviews and analysis <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-displays-arent-the-gold-standard-you-think-they-are">focus too much on lab tests</a> and not enough on the human part of the equation. Most people don't care about the difference between 97% and 99% color accuracy, and it's unlikely most people will ever notice that difference anyway, even if you hold two phones next to each other. Instead, I want to focus on the human quotient for these display reviews.</p><p>In the case of the Galaxy S25 Ultra, its display is weakest in the comfort category, but it has some standout attributes that are noteworthy. Let's start with the positive!</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-reflectivity"><span>Reflectivity</span></h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:67.58%;"><img id="YvPeSi8LiMTv4uvRQM6hKe" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-vs-oneplus-13-reflectivity-above" alt="Testing screen reflectivity in full sunlight between the OnePlus 13 and Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YvPeSi8LiMTv4uvRQM6hKe.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:67.58%;"><img id="5BsK2xaJaV2ynqyyzaGfGe" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-vs-oneplus-13-reflectivity-side" alt="Testing screen reflectivity in full sunlight between the OnePlus 13 and Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5BsK2xaJaV2ynqyyzaGfGe.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Samsung's anti-glare filter, first introduced on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, is one of the best things Samsung has ever done for screen visibility. In the above images, I compare it to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>, our current favorite Android phone, and one with higher peak brightness capabilities than the Galaxy S25 Ultra.</p><p>Despite being a brighter display, the OnePlus 13 is harder to see outdoors because of the reflectivity of the glass. The Galaxy S25 Ultra is incredibly clean and vibrant, while it's just plain difficult to see the OnePlus 13. Now, to be clear, I'm not picking on OnePlus here. Nearly every other phone on the market is just as hard to see, and it's because almost no other company uses the type of anti-glare glass the S25 Ultra has.</p><p>The only problem here is that most screen protectors for the phone don't have an anti-glare layer applied, meaning <em>everything</em> that makes the display so visible outdoors gets ruined. Make sure you get one like this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Anti-Reflecting-Fingerprint-Anti-Scratch-EF-US938CTEGUS/dp/B0DKZ7F64Y/">official Samsung anti-reflection film</a> to keep the display's best attribute from being ruined!</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-eye-comfort-settings"><span>Eye comfort settings</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PmNk3tqBQiWRdMRBrPP3eY" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-eye-comfort-mode-blue-light-filter" alt="Comparing the blue subpixel brightness on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra with eye comfort mode enabled and disabled" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PmNk3tqBQiWRdMRBrPP3eY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung's blue light filter, which the company calls "Eye Comfort Shield," helps block blue light by reducing the intensity of blue subpixels. This makes the display appear much yellower and does a good job of reducing blue light emissions.</p><p>You can see this in action in the image above, which I captured with a microscope using a pure white image on the screen. Note how the intensity of the blue subpixels is notably reduced when Eye Comfort Shield is enabled.</p><p>By default, the mode will automatically adjust blue light based on the time of day. During daylight hours, blue light will be close to the default setting as if the mode were disabled. At night, the blue light will be automatically reduced to help better match the circadian rhythm of the human body, since most natural blue light only occurs during the day from sunlight.</p><p>Unfortunately, Samsung's only real eye care solution is blue light blocking, a problem that you'll learn more about in the brightness section below.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-color-accuracy-and-depth"><span>Color accuracy and depth</span></h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4864px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ujgdvC9EXHDbA5GgwxeptU" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-vs-galaxy-s24-ultra-colors-natural" alt="Comparing the color calibration and adjustment settings between the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra and Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ujgdvC9EXHDbA5GgwxeptU.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4864" height="2736" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4864px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bfnyLUBUPP5XfnExmUHUvU" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-vs-galaxy-s24-ultra-colors-vivid" alt="Comparing the color calibration and adjustment settings between the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra and Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bfnyLUBUPP5XfnExmUHUvU.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4864" height="2736" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4864px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oFsSFgABsyLZWotyhZTcvU" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-vs-galaxy-s24-ultra-colors-manual" alt="Comparing the color calibration and adjustment settings between the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra and Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oFsSFgABsyLZWotyhZTcvU.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4864" height="2736" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>When the Galaxy S24 Ultra first launched, the display was considered "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-washed-out-display-is-intentional">washed out</a>" by some long-time Samsung fans.

The main problem is that Samsung continues to use 8-bit panels in their phones despite the entire industry switching to 10-bit as the standard.</p><p>For the test, I used an 8-bit and 10-bit gradient comparison image <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/jursonovicst/gradient">found on GitHub</a>. On the Galaxy S25 Ultra's panel, there's little to no difference between the 8-bit and 10-bit gradients. The OnePlus 13 shows additional colors throughout all the gradients, although the green gradient showed up best on camera.</p><p>Many users have complained about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1800809349214028132">color banding on wallpaper</a> and other images, even ones taken with the Galaxy S25 Ultra's camera, since that camera can capture 10-bit images. And while Samsung absolutely needs to upgrade their displays to 10-bit to keep up with the pack, I want to commend them for not stooping to using color dithering to fake 10-bit color. Some other companies, like Xiaomi, use color dithering to fake deeper colors and it's painful for some users because of the flickering pixels.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-brightness-and-dimming"><span>Brightness and dimming</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:30.17%;"><img id="UNtpQJQV6hpfX8ckEVY7Fe" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-brightness-comparison" alt="Comparing brightness levels of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra's display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UNtpQJQV6hpfX8ckEVY7Fe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="5184" height="1564" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Everything this phone tells you about its brightness levels is a lie. Setting the brightness slider at 100% never actually means 100% brightness under any circumstance.</p><p>Normal "100%" brightness, like most phones, doesn't come close to the advertised peak brightness. That's normally reserved for the dedicated "sunlight mode" that gets activated when a bright light, like the sun, shines on the screen's light sensor. We can force this by holding a flashlight up to the display and measuring the nit output. Even in sunlight mode, the display tops out at around 2,000 nits.</p><p>At normal 100% brightness, this number sits at around 800 nits, which is surprisingly low for a modern phone. Extra brightness mode brings this number up to around 1,500 nits, which is closer to an expected value from "100% brightness," but that's not the biggest problem with this display's brightness capabilities.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Jb49z63HfNdBz2Ag7Qecs6" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-dimming-comparison" alt="Comparing the dimming methods of a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra at all brightness levels, including PWM frequency graphs" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Jb49z63HfNdBz2Ag7Qecs6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="5184" height="2916" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Instead, that comes down to Samsung using Pulse Width Modulation (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a>) to control brightness.

The display on the Galaxy S25 Ultra shines particularly bright outside, where the anti-glare filter makes it more easily visible than any other phone I've ever used. It's a brilliant spot of engineering that I wish more phones would copy!</p><p>But while blue light control and color accuracy are good, Samsung's continued use of 8-bit panels means color banding is more common on the Galaxy S25 Ultra than on any other competing phone in this price range. Luminance consistency and brightness management are also mediocre, with noticeable grain at low brightness and low-HZ PWM dimming at all brightness levels.</p><p>While the display looks good on the surface and does a great job of highlighting the strengths of AMOLED — vibrant colors, deep blacks, and no ghosting — the quality of the panel Samsung is using leaves a lot to be desired for a $1,300 phone. Even budget Android phones offer better dimming methods and faster PWM rates, native 10-bit depth, and no mura.</p><p>Does this mean the Galaxy S25 Ultra's display is bad? No, not at all, but there's plenty of room for improvement on the Galaxy S26 Ultra.</p> ]]></dc:content>
