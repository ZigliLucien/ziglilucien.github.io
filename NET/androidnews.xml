I'm also interested in staying healthy so I can live long enough to become a burden on my kids. Like many folks, I use a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">smartwatch</a> as a wearable fitness tracker.</p><p>I'm not the first to say it, nor will I be the last, but that has never stopped me before, so here goes: wearable options for people in a wheelchair suck. Some, like Garmin smartwatches, are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-best-smartwatch-if-youre-wheelchair-bound">better than others</a>, but they still don't compare to using one for people without mobility issues.</p><p>Unfortunately, I don't see this changing any time soon, if ever.</p><h2 id="we-re-built-different-2">We're built different</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ReQt7HNf2JKsWow7hoJ4fN" name="Fitbit-Premium-Health-Coach-Today-tab" alt="A photo of the Google Pixel Watch 4 sitting next to a Pixel 9a open to the Fitbit app, showing the Fitbit Premium Health Coach preview with the Today tab open; it shows new widgets and insights." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ReQt7HNf2JKsWow7hoJ4fN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The difficulty in creating accurate and useful fitness trackers for wheelchair users stems from a combination of technological limitations, fundamental differences in movement, and a historical lack of dedicated research and market focus.</p><p>The core technology in most commercial wearables is designed for the "able-bodied" population, which creates fundamental inaccuracies when applied to wheelchair use. I'm talking smartwatches here, because something as small as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">smart ring</a> or s<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/lumia-2-launches-as-the-first-customizable-smart-earrings-that-track-your-overall-health">mart earrings</a> simply doesn't have the space to fit anything more inside.</p><p>Wearable trackers primarily use an accelerometer to count steps by detecting specific motions involved in walking or running. That data is what's used to calculate other features, like calorie counting or a sort of body battery measurement.</p><p>When you use a manual wheelchair, the arm and torso movements are different from they are when walking or running. This usually leads to either an overestimation or an underestimation of "steps" and calories burned. A simple accelerometer is not designed to measure these.</p><h2 id="different-tech-is-needed-2">Different tech is needed</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="KnRXHNGqaUaah6kE3S3xMR" name="Garmin-Venu-4-review-29" alt="Garmin Venu 4 Elevate sensor" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KnRXHNGqaUaah6kE3S3xMR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The software algorithms that determine energy expenditure use a combination of data such as heart rate, height, and weight, and accelerometer readings. To make matters worse, all this is designed with lower-body movement in mind.</p><p>To push a wheelchair, you rely on your upper body. Usually, this is less demanding than "normal" leg-based movements. This means that even if a wearable <em>underestimates</em> your number of pushes, the result can still be <em>overestimated</em> because your body isn't working as hard to move forward.</p><p>It's difficult to reasonably assess any sort of fitness goal when things are both over- and underestimated all at the same time. Garmin, to its credit, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/garmin-technology/health-science/wheelchair-physiology/?cjdata=MXxOfDB8WXww&zebratwo=CJ&cjevent=809df364d6cb11f08069033d0a82b820&utm_source=CJ&utm_medium=Text" target="_blank">does explain how it tries to compensate</a> for this and use a different software algorithm when you use Wheelchair Mode on one of the company's watches.</p><p>Apple, Samsung, and Google are all working on making it better, too, even if they aren't quite there yet. Even with my Garmin, the readings and calculations aren't very accurate because of differences in movement and the limitations of "normal" sensors in gauging it.</p><p>Modern medicine isn't likely to change how people in wheelchairs use their bodies to move, but technology could be built that caters to it. The University of Pittsburgh’s Human Engineering Research Lab is working on how to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3058074/these-scientists-are-building-fitness-trackers-that-work-for-people-with-disabilities">build a fitness tracking system for people with ambulatory issues, </a>but it would probably lead to an entirely new product category of devices. Their research involves wearable tech on the wrist and face (to monitor breathing and oxygen intake) as well as tech on the wheelchair itself. Think of a smart chair, like we've seen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-partners-adidas-launch-new-smart-insole-can-track-your-soccer-skills">Google explore smart shoe insoles</a>.</p><h2 id="the-market-isn-t-there-2">The market isn't there</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZyoCdfDsYxkEMwu5CmwMSK" name="Garmin_Venu3_push-counting-1.jpg" alt="Garmin Venu 3 push tracker" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZyoCdfDsYxkEMwu5CmwMSK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Maybe a bigger issue is the market itself and historical research into the problem. I'm not complaining that people without any issues walking around don't think about wheelchair users, and I never want to sound demanding. The fact is that not as much research goes into wheelchair fitness tracking. This can change and probably will, but it's unlikely to catch up.</p><p>The market simply isn't there to justify the enormous costs. There are more people with ambulatory issues than you probably realize, but the number is still dwarfed by those without any. And, to be frank, many people in a wheelchair just don't care about their fitness. For every wheel-basketball player (those guys are amazing and my heroes), there will be dozens (or more) users who aren't interested in seeing how active they can be. To be fair, it is tough to give a damn when you live in a world that wasn't designed to accommodate you.</p><p>In any case, the number of people who would buy a costly fitness-tracking system will never be high. Any company willing to do the research isn't going to profit from it, and companies that actually build the devices would probably lose money. For now, it's in the hands of forward-looking thinktanks like the University of Pittsburgh.</p><h2 id="for-now-i-ll-stick-with-my-garmin-2">For now, I'll stick with my Garmin</h2><p>I'm not bitter. I've learned how to use the information my Garmin watch gives me, and even though I can't trust it at face value, it is mostly consistent. It's useful to help in some ways; I lift weights to keep my upper body strong, and it can help me there.</p><p>If things ever change, I would try to buy into a better way, though I'm in the minority. I'm just happy that big tech hasn't forgotten about me, even if they're taking a long time to produce mediocre results.</p> ]]></dc:content>

With features like "PC Connect" and "Likeness," Google is reimagining creativity, giving users more room to be productive with the multi-view screen and a digital avatar of you that mirrors your facial expressions and hand gestures in real-time, during team meetings.</p><p>As for Project Aura, which is supposedly equipped with a 70-degree field of view and optical see-through technology, these glasses are said to overlay the digital content within your field of view, turning it into a massive screen for work or entertainment.</p><h2 id="one-ui-8-5-is-here-sorta-2">One UI 8.5 is here...

While it might sound like a small software tweak, One UI 8.5 brings new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI features</a> to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/which-samsung-galaxy-s25-model-should-you-buy">Galaxy S25 series</a> for now.</p><p>This includes an updated Photo Assist that helps you continue without saving each iteration on your device.

Storage Share lets users access files across Galaxy phones, tablets, PCs, and even Samsung TVs. Many apps, including Calculator, Clock, and Samsung Health, have been redesigned for better visuals.</p><p>The One UI 8.5 beta is only available on Galaxy S25 series smartphones.

Android Central's Nicholas Sutrich and Derrek Lee got a package from Motorola earlier this week, and the box had an invite to its CES display, plus a wooden flip book that opens and folds into a lamp, with a dim red light.</p><p>According to Sutrich, the lamp features a magnetic clasp that keeps it fully open and folded backward. The most obvious indication is within the invite itself, which states, "We're getting ready to unfold a new perspective at Lenovo Tech World, set to take place on January 6." The emphasis on "unfold" caught our attention, given that Motorola's current foldable phones are all Flip devices.</p><p>The mysterious device might also feature a wooden finish, as suggested by the wooden cover of the foldable lamp. It also has the Motorola "M" logo engraved on it, with the line "every fold reveals a possibility."</p><h2 id="december-pixel-update-got-bugg-y-for-some-2">December Pixel update got bugg-y for some</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="uPmu5rhFzr7dnamiB939CQ" name="google-pixel-10-wireless-qi2-charging-puck-02" alt="The official Google Pixelsnap Qi2 wireless charger and dock for the Google Pixel 10 series" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uPmu5rhFzr7dnamiB939CQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsungs-next-galaxy-watch-ultra-wont-land-in-2025-heres-why-the-2026-reboot-matters"><strong>here</strong></a></p><p>Google recently rolled out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/december-drop-google-brings-fresh-updates-for-android-users">Android 16 QPR2 update</a> for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review">Pixel 10</a> series.

Following the update, many Pixel 10 series users report that the Pixel Stand (2nd Gen) no longer works, even though it previously worked at the "perfect angle." As reported on Reddit, placing a Pixel 10 on the Stand now causes it to flash orange and white and reportedly throw a charging error, suggesting Google intentionally broke support.</p><p>This only seems to suggest that Google wants to push its new Qi2 chargers to Pixel 10 owners, officially ending support for others on the market.</p><h2 id="qualcomm-brings-two-mid-range-chips-to-the-areana-2">Qualcomm brings two mid-range chips to the areana</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:814px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.14%;"><img id="kbidJCdCpXnihJvWUTTP3C" name="qualcomm-extends-support-for-updates-on-android-devices-snapdragon-8-elite" alt="Qualcomm 8 years support for phones" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kbidJCdCpXnihJvWUTTP3C.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="814" height="457" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/one-ui-8-5-update-changelog-leaked"><strong>here</strong></a></p><p>Qualcomm announced two chips today (Dec 11) for the mid-range and entry-level markets: the Snapdragon 6s 4G Gen 2 and the Snapdragon 4 Gen 4.

Qualcomm has placed its Kryo CPU in this chip, too; however, its speeds only peak at 2.3GHz. When it comes to the Adreno GPU, smooth graphics with support for 120fps are highlighted.

Similarly, the camera app on many foldable phones, such as the Oppo Find N5, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>, and even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x-fold-5-review">Vivo X Fold 5</a>, offers a feature that splits the camera into two halves, with the viewfinder on the right and previews of recent shots on the left.</p><p>While most foldable smartphone makers have offered this feature, Google surprisingly missed out.

Moreover, as the report suggests, apps that don't show up in the app drawer, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-auto-review">Android Auto</a> and Android System WebView, are also affected by this change.</p><p>We don't yet know why Google is doing this, and there doesn't seem to be a clear reason behind the change for now. However, the option disappearing from the Play Store doesn't mean you can no longer downgrade or uninstall system app updates.</p><p>You can still uninstall system app updates by going to the app's settings, tapping the three-dot menu, and selecting Uninstall updates. It's just that the option has now been removed from the Play Store.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The problem is most likely due to Google’s move to newer software. In September, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/wear-os/google-phasing-out-wear-os-weather-app">stopped offering the Weather app for devices running Wear OS 6</a>.</p><p>The plan was to push users toward manufacturer-specific apps, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/pixel-weather-app-coming-to-pixel-watch">new Pixel Weather on the Pixel Watch 2, 3, and 4</a>. However, Google explicitly stated that the legacy app would continue working for anyone who already had it installed.</p><p>That promise has run into trouble. The prevailing theory — at least on Reddit — is that Google pushed an update intended for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a> that inadvertently broke compatibility with older firmware versions. Since the original Pixel Watch still uses older software, the app and the watch are not working together.</p><p>Google’s support representative said the team is aware of the issue and is working on a firmware update to fix it. However, there is no clear timeline for when the fix will arrive. This is frustrating for users, especially since these devices are failing at a basic task.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This includes devices like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-gen-2">Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses</a> and other wearables that can quietly record photos, videos, or audio without drawing attention.</p><p>This update is part of the cruise line’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.msccruisesusa.com/manage-booking/before-you-go/luggage" target="_blank">luggage and prohibited items policy</a>. Anything that can secretly record data is now not allowed in shared spaces.

So, you probably can’t wear them in dining halls, pool decks, theaters, or lounges without the crew stepping in.</p><p>If you are caught wearing them in common areas, staff could confiscate them. The only place you can safely use your smart glasses appears to be the private confines of your cabin.

The publication cites Bloomberg reporter <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/yoolimleenews/status/1999357299547357259">Yoolim Lee</a>, who was reporting on Samsung's initial launch of the TriFold in South Korea. According to Lee, consumers in South Korea were waiting outside stores for nearly 24 hours to get their hands on the Galaxy Z TriFold. The publication states that, after the device launched, it "sold out within minutes."</p><p>It was stated that Samsung provided roughly 20 retailers across its home country with TriFold inventory in preparation for the debut. However, in-store supplies were quickly snatched up, as was its stock online.</p><p>While it was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/report-says-samsungs-galaxy-z-trifold-will-be-incredibly-sparse-and-this-is-why">previously reported</a> that Samsung was only looking to manufacture ~20,000 to ~30,000 TriFold units, its quick sellout could be seen as a positive. Nevertheless, the publication reports that Samsung has already started "collecting restock sign-ups," potentially indicating another round of Galaxy Z TriFolds sometime in the future.</p><h2 id="this-is-the-trifold-2">This is the TriFold</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oXYnF9FoswnR2ANM367cHQ" name="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold hands-on testing at Dubai Mall on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oXYnF9FoswnR2ANM367cHQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/its-official-samsungs-galaxy-z-trifold-launch">announced the Galaxy Z TriFold</a> earlier this month, cementing in our minds a device that had been rumored for a while. Android Central's Harish Jonnalagadda <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-hands-on">went hands-on</a> with the phone recently and noticed one key aspect: its design is much better than originally theorized. Compared to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-is-the-most-exciting-phone-around">Huawei's Mate XT</a>, Samsung's TriFold went a little further with its inner screen and cover display by offering 120Hz (the former goes to 90Hz).</p><p>Jonnalagadda highlights that Samsung only plans to produce roughly 500 units for its UAE launch, highlighting a trend with its first go at the form-factor.</p><p>Similarly, during the phone's launch, Samsung announced that it plans to bring the Galaxy Z TriFold to the U.S. early in 2026. Just how many models the country should expect is still unknown at this time. What the U.S. can likely expect is a steep price tag. The TriFold went for KRW 3.59 million, which equates to ~$2,430. The Galaxy Z TriFold sports a 10-inch display when fully opened, as well as a thin 3.9mm build.</p><p>Consumers will also find a 200MP main camera on its rear panel, paired with an ultra-wide 12MP camera, and a 10MP telephoto sensor.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The first major update taps Gemini for improved translations for more nuanced instances, such as local expressions and slang. Google states its AI will attempt to provide a more accurate translation of phrases, rather than "a literal word-for-word translation."</p><p>This update is rolling out today in India and the U.S. in English and over 20 languages, including Spanish, Japanese, and German.</p><p>The second update rolling out soon concerns Translate's "language learning." Now, Google is giving users who take their practices seriously a challenge. It's a feature you'd find in other similar apps, like Duolingo, as Translate receives "Streaks," which tracks how many days you've shown up to practice.</p><p>Additionally, Translate is bringing its learning tools to 20 more countries this month.</p><h2 id="connections-through-ai-translations-2">Connections through AI translations</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6F3oGXf8dfM" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>The final update for Translate isn't (necessarily) an update, as Google states it's expanding a beta regarding "real-time translations."</p><p>This feature directly calls on Gemini's speech-to-speech capabilities. Google states the Translate app will work to "preserve the tone, emphasis, and cadence of each speaker to create more natural translations." What's more, this feature can work when you're wearing headphones. Google teases that users wearing headphones can open the Translate app while watching a show in another language or while listening to a lecture, and listen to a translation of what's said in real-time.</p><p>The beta will provide a "Live Translate" button for users to tap to get started. This expanded beta is arriving in the Translate app so more users can get involved and offer feedback. It's slowly becoming available today (Dec 12) in the Translate app on Android for the U.S., Mexico, and India.</p><p>Google teases that this feature will work with "any headphones" and features support for over 70 languages. Those with iPhones, and in other countries, can expect this to arrive in 2026.</p><p>Google Translate's small "challenges" update, which brings streaks to the fold, builds on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-translate-gemini-in-customized-language-practice-update">language practice patch</a> from the summer. Tapping "practice" gets users started, as they inform the AI how well they understand a language. This is your "level." After which, the app will help you with goals for your daily practice sessions.</p> ]]></dc:content>

As described in our glowing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-3-review">4.5/5-star review</a>, the flagship tablet has an incredible price-to-performance ratio, with a stunning 13.2-inch LCD 144Hz display, the unrivalled Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, and a thin, lightweight build straight out of the box.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="AFPHG3zJvf8SDsRGkFumQN" name="Hades 2 via GameSir GameHub on the OnePlus Pad 3" alt="Hades 2 via GameSir GameHub on the OnePlus Pad 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AFPHG3zJvf8SDsRGkFumQN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Thanks to the 12GB of RAM and 256GB of onboard storage, the OnePlus Pad 3 is powerful enough for gaming and large file management alike, while the 12,140mAh battery should last you up to 17 hours on a single charge. The device also boasts an 8-speaker stereo audio system, which is just as cool as it sounds, and there are plenty of first-party accessories to trick out the tablet to your heart's desire.</p><p>As with any device, there are trade-offs with the OnePlus Pad 3. You won't get as many AI features as you would with a Samsung Galaxy Tab or iPad, and the lack of a microSD slot is a bit disappointing (although a portable SSD will get the job done just as well). All in all, these drawbacks are pretty minor, and I'd choose the OnePlus Pad 3 over its mainstream rivals any day of the week — <em>especially </em>when you slap on a Black Friday-level discount.</p><h2 id="more-holiday-shopping-2025-quick-links-2">More holiday shopping 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 50% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>major discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The 2024 device boasts a vibrant display with weeks of battery life and a responsive stylus pen. The main problem with the e-ink tablet is its price, but now that the 2025 model has come along, Best Buy is knocking it down to a much more reasonable $280. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/amazon-kindle-scribe-32gb-2024-tungsten/J39TLSYV7G" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="a8e8c686-e2b6-411f-8b3c-14f60740ced7" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$419.99" data-dimension48="$419.99" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p>To be clear, <strong>this discount is NOT for the updated 2025 Kindle Scribe</strong>. This historic price drop is only available on the 2024 model. If you'd rather spend 500 bucks on the latest model, Amazon is currently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DVQQGMCZ"><strong>offering some trade-in credit</strong></a><strong> </strong>(although it won't arrive by Christmas).</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JQ7uNrmzNw9HdwgWSitEbA" name="Amazon-Kindle-Scribe-Active-Canvas.jpg" alt="A person writes on an e-book using the Amazon Kindle Scribe" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JQ7uNrmzNw9HdwgWSitEbA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Amazon)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="should-i-buy-the-amazon-kindle-scribe-2">Should I buy the Amazon Kindle Scribe?</h2><p>Whether you're a reader, artist, or compulsive notetaker, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-amazon-kindle">2024 Kindle Scribe is a great device</a> for getting things done. You get a 10.2-inch 300ppi glare-free display with an included stylus that works straight out of the box, plus weeks of battery life depending on usage. The notetaking function itself feels almost indistinguishable from pen on paper, and you even get a collapsing "eraser" on the end of the stylus. </p><p>Another major selling point of the Kindle Scribe (2024) is its AI features. These tools can be used to convert messy handwriting into something more readable, or you can customize the length and tone of your notes to make them feel a bit more refined.  </p><h2 id="should-i-buy-the-2024-model-or-the-new-kindle-scribe-2025-2">Should I buy the 2024 model or the new Kindle Scribe (2025)?</h2><p>This historic discount on the 2024 Kindle Scribe is probably happening because the tablet has been officially supplanted by a newer model. While the Kindle Scribe (2025) does have some significant upgrades over its predecessor — the display is larger and more lightweight, for instance — I'm not sure it's worth the $500 price tag.  </p><p>For over $200 less, you can get the 2024 tablet and enjoy a very similar experience, especially if you simply want a device for reading and casual note-taking. If, on the other hand, you <em>really</em> want to drop 500 bucks on a tablet, I'd skip the Kindles altogether and go for something more comprehensive, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-3-review">OnePlus Pad 3</a>. </p><h2 id="holiday-shopping-2025-quick-links-2">Holiday shopping 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 50% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>major discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

And while Google director Juston Payne said these AI glasses will "help bring this category into existence," Meta brought smart glasses and XR into the mainstream first. So it's fair to speculate how Google and Samsung will crack Meta's AI glasses stranglehold.</p><p>We don't know how Warby Parker and Gentle Monster will design these glasses, nor do we have camera or battery specs yet. But the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a> UI and apps felt polished and consumer-ready in my hour-long demo. I already know what it'll be like to use these glasses in daily life.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jpxLZyY5GMk" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>As a result, I expect the display-free Samsung glasses and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-gen-2">Ray-Ban Meta glasses</a> to have remarkably similar software, including "live" AI advice and translation. The mono-HUD glasses will, likewise, resemble the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-glasses">Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses</a>, with their petite app widgets, turn-by-turn navigation, and other shared apps.</p><p>They're similar enough that people may end up choosing their smart glasses based on Warby Parker, Gentle Monster, or Ray-Ban/Oakley styles, not the AI behind it.</p><p>That said, I've already noticed three key differences that could help the Android XR smart glasses stand out and offer key advantages over what Meta offers. This doesn't mean these glasses will be <em>better</em>, as Meta has three generations of hardware experience that's paid off so far. But it proves that long-time Meta glasses wearers should be paying close attention.</p><h2 id="gemini-has-one-key-advantage-over-meta-ai-apps-2">Gemini has one key advantage over Meta AI: Apps</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2256px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LgQbzhPfbs6njQag6t8sBY" name="Android-XR-ask-AI" alt="A video still of a person wearing Google glasses asking about a bird on their palm, with a pop-up text showing info on its type." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LgQbzhPfbs6njQag6t8sBY.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2256" height="1269" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'm not going to get into the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> vs. Llama debate.

For example, pulling info from Messages or Maps and then creating a Keep note from the result.</p><p>This interconnectivity with other apps will let the HUD display a preview of your Nest Doorbell feed, Google TV controls, a pop-up of a Gmail subject line, and more. And it's not just for Google apps: the deep Android integration means <em>any</em> Gemini-compatible apps should be compatible. Meta supports the essential phone, messaging, music, and social apps, but Google could have an "ecosystem," at least on Android; iOS users could have a more specialized experience.</p><h2 id="google-s-photography-expertise-will-be-vital-2">Google's photography expertise will be vital</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="nzjUrGrpqXGxzKKBTBfWkX" name="Ray-Ban-Meta-Gen-2-close-up-front-side" alt="A photo of the Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) smart glasses sitting on a rock, angled to focus on the right camera cutout." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nzjUrGrpqXGxzKKBTBfWkX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When I reviewed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-gen-2-review">Ray-Ban Gen 2s</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oakley-meta-vanguard-smart-glasses-review">Oakley Meta Vanguards</a>, I appreciated the high-res action photos captured with such petite sensors, as well as how well they stabilize videos, so I appear to slide forward rather than rock and bounce with every step. A lot of postprocessing goes into making this work.</p><p>My expectation is that Google and Samsung will handle computational photography at least as well as Meta. They both make some of the best camera phones, specializing in areas such as motion capture, AI-powered zoom, edge detection with targeted blurring, and more.</p><p>Of course, Samsung can't fit Ultra-quality sensors with zoom into glasses frames; "physics will get in the way," as Payne explained, particularly for low-light photos. But he thinks they can "push up to that level of quality," and I've seen how, for example, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">Pixel 9a</a> produced better photography than other mid-range phones despite its smaller, flatter sensors.</p><p>Taking photos on Ray-Ban Meta glasses is also challenging without a viewfinder, so you don't know how close to stand. But during my Android XR glasses demo, they showed a viewfinder function on a synced Pixel Watch, so you can check if your photo angle looks right in the moment, then either retake it or use Gemini to edit it.</p><h2 id="the-android-xr-wear-os-connection-will-be-key-2">The Android XR-Wear OS connection will be key</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2088px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="mPAXtZxUhTkgdRaaVfKPcN" name="Pixel-Watch-4-double-pinch-answer-call" alt="A render of the Pixel Watch 4 showing an incoming phone call screen, with the green Answer button showing a Double Pinch gesture animation." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mPAXtZxUhTkgdRaaVfKPcN.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2088" height="1175" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Meta Ray-Ban Display really benefits from having an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-semg-wristband-whitepaper">sEMG band</a> that reads your hand's neural inputs, recognizing gestures without needing to see them on camera.

Disco, as a browser, functions quite similarly to what users already experience from Gemini. Upon opening, the AI browser operates like a chat, allowing users to ask for assistance with planning a trip or more. The AI will respond in kind, offering links for suggested places to go; however, it's when these links (tabs) are compiled that we get Disco's first main feature: GenTabs.</p><p>According to Google, GenTabs "are generated based on your specific tabs and your specific goal."</p><p>In one of the company's examples, the user is trying to prepare a seven-day meal plan that helps them manage their cholesterol. Disco's AI opened a few links to get them started, but it went further by turning those links and the information available into a "custom, interactive app." From this "app," Disco displays the days of the week, and when clicked, the user can quickly see what meals they should make for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.</p><p>Google states, "there is no end to what you can make," as GenTabs can make Match Games through its custom apps, data about science, gardening, and much more. What GenTabs generates is all based on the user's prompt; the more specific you are, the better. For gardening, if you're in the planning stages, and Disco's AI knows this, it can create a grid where the user can place the icons of what they would plant.</p><h2 id="more-helpful-ai-2">More helpful AI</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1074px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.87%;"><img id="akmwxSq29XbsHrDow88LmT" name="google-labs-disco-gentabs-meal-prep" alt="Google Labs kickstarts its "Disco" AI browser experiment, which brings GenTabs: a custom app in a tab that is showing a user what meals they should make to help their cholesterol." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/akmwxSq29XbsHrDow88LmT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1074" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google Labs)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If Disco is of interest, users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf7l1a9m_JlpeZGKF5iF6BwXwU9TUhMaDXXHo-ZuXqXWTnPHg/viewform">can join the waitlist</a> for Google's experiment.

Walmart is currently slashing $70 off the device, plus this bundle deal comes with a ton of free goodies, including a wireless mouse, external CD/DVD drive, and a 1TB portable SSD.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Lenovo-IdeaPad-Slim-3-Chromebook-14-Full-HD-Display-MediaTek-Kompanio-520-CPU-4GB-RAM-64GB-eMMC-256GB-Micro-SD-Card-Wi-Fi-6-Business-Student-Chrome-O/17059813846" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="829c4d71-a10f-4632-ad95-16d5b085aa13" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$339.99" data-dimension48="$339.99" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><h2 id="holiday-shopping-2025-quick-links-7">Holiday shopping 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 50% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>major discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The gigantic foldable will serve some serious screen real estate, bringing 10 inches of fabulous AMOLED in a neatly folded form factor.</p><p>Thanks to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-introducing-galaxy-z-trifold-shape-whats-next-mobile-innovation">official press release</a> posted by Samsung, we can confidently say that the Galaxy Z TriFold will boast a 5,600 mAh three-cell battery system. Samsung is pairing this generous battery with 45W fast wired charging via USB-C, and of course, 15W fast wireless charging as well. The Trifold will also support Wireless PowerShare, so users will be able to charge their earbuds or other phones with the Trifold in a pinch.</p><p>The other specifications of the device sound mighty powerful, too. Everything from the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset to the 200MP camera sounds incredible. It's a shame that magnetic Qi2 support is missing in action, but hopefully, Samsung will tackle it with the next iteration of the TriFold.</p><p>For now, we are excited to see how the U.S. launch of the long-awaited Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold will proceed. The tri-foldable market is very small, and so far, only Huawei has made our jaws drop with its stunning, impossibly thin <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-is-the-most-exciting-phone-around">Mate XT</a>.</p><p>Our reviewer Harish Jonnalagadda called the Huawei Mate XT "the most exciting phone" he had used in a long time, so Samsung has some major competition to beat. Can Samsung, a well-established and respected name in the foldables market, knock over Huawei's crown? While Jonnalagadda's hands-on went incredibly well, it's hard to say for sure until the device has been tested in the long run and reviewed in depth. We'll have to wait until Q1 2026 to find out, because that's the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-release-date">tentative launch window</a> of the device.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="e34f7713-c353-4408-acf7-79a6c8e26c26">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/isAoL5q4Ju5wkYovSpMZSb.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>A new era of foldables</strong></em></p><p>Samsung is throwing its hat in the ring with the Galaxy Z TriFold.

Now, Disney has changed direction by investing $1 billion in equity in OpenAI, marking a major shift in how studios work with generative AI.</p><p>Beginning in early 2026, this partnership will connect <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/openai-sora-video-generator-vs-google-veo-3">OpenAI’s Sora text-to-video model</a> with Disney’s large library of intellectual property. Users will be able to create short videos featuring over 200 licensed characters from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, and Star Wars, according to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://openai.com/index/disney-sora-agreement/" target="_blank">joint announcement</a> from both companies.</p><p>This includes popular characters such as Iron Man, Captain America, The Mandalorian, and Rey. Animated favorites like Mickey Mouse, Minnie, Simba, Mufasa, Stitch, and Baymax are also available. Users can access well-known costumes, props, and vehicles, and generate custom Frozen or Toy Story clips almost instantly by typing a prompt.</p><h2 id="strict-limits-apply-2">Strict limits apply</h2><p>However, there are clear restrictions. Disney limits use to animated, masked, and creature characters only.</p><p>That means this deal explicitly excludes actor likenesses and voices. You won't be generating a digital Robert Downey Jr. or cloning Mark Hamill’s voice for your clips.</p><p>While the tech is impressive, the deal might spark fears that democratizing these characters devalues the hand-crafted storytelling Disney is known for.</p><p>Despite these concerns, Disney plans to embrace user-generated content by curating select fan-made videos to stream on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/disney-plus">Disney Plus</a>. This experiment could either boost fan engagement or affect the service’s reputation.</p><p>In addition to consumer features, Disney will use OpenAI’s tools internally. The company plans to become a major customer, using ChatGPT to help employees develop new products and experiences.</p><p>The rollout is planned for early 2026. Whether the result is a new era of creativity or a flood of digital noise remains to be seen.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Make sure to <a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=androidcentral.com" target="_blank"><strong>set Android Central as a preferred source</strong></a> in Google Search, and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should"><strong>find out why you should</strong></a> so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>Spotify already curates and produces content it believes you'll enjoy, but its newest update relinquishes control to the user.</p><p>Spotify announces in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2025-12-10/spotify-prompted-playlists-algorithm-gustav-soderstrom/">a Newsroom post</a> that it's beginning an overseas beta for Premium users called "Prompted Playlists." This beta, exclusive to New Zealand users for the time being, lets users generate a playlist that abides by their interests, curiosities, and more. Tapping "Create" at the bottom right in the app is where users will find Prompted Playlists. From there, users can "describe" and dictate everything about the playlist.</p><p>If you're looking to get into metalcore, you can tell the playlist to start there, and then offer suggestions you've never heard before. If you're in your K-Pop era, then describe the kind of playlist you want to listen to.</p><p>The post states that Prompted Playlists leverages "your entire Spotify listening history, all the way back to day one."</p><p>After writing your prompt, users can hop into "set updates." This is where you can channel your inner Spotify by setting how often the playlist should refresh its content.  Users can decide to have it update daily at specific times or weekly. The "ideas" button is just what you'd expect: suggestions on where to start if the ole noggin's not sure where to begin.</p><p>After everything's said and done, and the playlist has been generated, Spotify states it will offer a little story behind every song. The company says the purpose of this is to make your generated playlist "feel alive."</p><h2 id="prompt-generate-listen-2">Prompt, generate, listen</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bsfbgD4hpoi4xXvmyjAksg" name="spotify-prompted-playlists-example" alt="Spotify's "Prompted Playlists" put you in control, giving you space to describe the playlist you want to listen to and control how often it updates." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bsfbgD4hpoi4xXvmyjAksg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Spotify)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Spotify informs users that, since Prompted Playlists is in beta, its experience may change as time progresses. This is in part due to user feedback and changes the platform envisions. What's more, Spotify states that the feature is wrapped in its bigger goals for the platform moving forward. The post highlights an interest in creating a more "personal" and "responsive" musical experience.</p><p>Spotify wants the user to take control of their music. The post teases that 2026 will hold more for listeners and artists. Regarding Prompted Playlists, there's no word on a U.S. beta; however, if all goes well, users in the region might not wait long.</p><p>We're starting to close out 2025, and with that comes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify/spotify-wrapped-2025-is-here">the usual Spotify Wrapped</a>. This year, the platform shook things up with "listening age" and "top albums." Users, of course, still got the usual "top songs" for the year, as well as some analytics behind the many music genres they listened to. Spotify Wrapped 2025 ended with files about you, which are detailed notes about your most diverse listening days and how your tastes might've changed throughout the year.</p><p>Elsewhere, an update last month made it easier for users to switch with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify/spotify-is-making-it-easier-to-switch-with-tunemymusic-playlist-transfers">TuneMyMusic's library transfer service</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This allows the hub to be attached to a phone, or the outside of a notebook, making it that much more convenient. The hub is MagSafe ready, and I didn't see any issues using it with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-17-pro-review">iPhone 17 Pro</a> or my Honor MagicBook 16 notebook.

I also like that the built-in cable coils around the housing of the hub, so it is essentially hidden away — this was a sore point with my previous USB-C hub, which had a cable jutting out.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4956px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.34%;"><img id="mdFaGCQ92xeHTApNUXnZpg" name="Satechi OntheGo 7-in-1 USB-C Hub" alt="Satechi OntheGo 7-in-1 USB-C Hub testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mdFaGCQ92xeHTApNUXnZpg.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4956" height="2792" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="2vhnJKAFocShDisPq9TVtg" name="Satechi OntheGo 7-in-1 USB-C Hub" alt="Satechi OntheGo 7-in-1 USB-C Hub testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2vhnJKAFocShDisPq9TVtg.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="FZoCHgwhWMTHBD2mEiz3vg" name="Satechi OntheGo 7-in-1 USB-C Hub" alt="Satechi OntheGo 7-in-1 USB-C Hub testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FZoCHgwhWMTHBD2mEiz3vg.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="T8JSzcyqpD5aKnJ3Ky37qg" name="Satechi OntheGo 7-in-1 USB-C Hub" alt="Satechi OntheGo 7-in-1 USB-C Hub testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/T8JSzcyqpD5aKnJ3Ky37qg.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Satechi did a great job with the port selection, and the OntheGo 7-in-1 USB-C Hub includes an HDMI port that goes up to 4K 60Hz, a Gigabit Ethernet port, dual USB-A ports with 5Gbps bandwidth, a USB-C PD port with passthrough, and an SD and MicroSD card reader.

Late last night, more details were revealed, as the AYANEO Pocket PLAY was shown off the teaser video seen below.</p><p>This aims to be the first phone with a built-in gamepad in at least a decade, as Sony held the patent which officially expired in early 2025. Since then, we've only seen one company release anything remotely resembling the Xperia Play, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/this-gaming-handheld-looks-like-a-psp-go-but-runs-android-and-is-100-off">Anbernic RG Slide</a> arriving in June 2025.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XVDNGMIlzmI" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>The teaser trailer does a pretty good job at what it's supposed to do, showing off the phone from every angle, but stopping short of providing too many details. As such, AYANEO has yet to share anything in regards to specs, pricing, or availability.</p><p>That being said, there aren't any secrets about the overall design, as the Pocket PLAY seems to be made from a combination of aluminum and glass. One can only hope there's a bit of plastic thrown in there somewhere, otherwise, this is going to be one hefty smartphone.</p><p>The screen slides upwards, locking into a flat position, which might be a disappointment to those who might've preferred an angled approach. Nevertheless, after sliding the screen out of the way, we're greeted with a full suite of gamepad controls.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Y5xpgUaUq78KRL3pcf9XJZ" name="ayaneo-pocket-play-promo-render-5" alt="Angled view of the AYANEO Pocket PLAY with the controls showing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Y5xpgUaUq78KRL3pcf9XJZ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYANEO)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4003px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.21%;"><img id="A4sxpb7Xbawa6LnbMNouWZ" name="ayaneo-pocket-play-promo-render-2" alt="AYANEO Pocket PLAY angled view of left side of controls" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/A4sxpb7Xbawa6LnbMNouWZ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4003" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYANEO)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4612px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.90%;"><img id="NsbPSKqK5RwKbyQGfReEJZ" name="ayaneo-pocket-play-promo-render-6" alt="AYANEO Pocket PLAY angled view of right side of controls" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NsbPSKqK5RwKbyQGfReEJZ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4612" height="2578" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYANEO)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4003px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.21%;"><img id="KccRvPS7FavrjLBqz3VCPZ" name="ayaneo-pocket-play-promo-render-1" alt="AYANEO Pocket PLAY in White front and back angled render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KccRvPS7FavrjLBqz3VCPZ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4003" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYANEO)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4003px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.21%;"><img id="xDeicFi8ewjKWJ3EUNmxMZ" name="ayaneo-pocket-play-promo-render-3" alt="AYANEO Pocket PLAY in Black front and back angled render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xDeicFi8ewjKWJ3EUNmxMZ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4003" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYANEO)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>These go beyond the standard ABXY+D-pad combination, as there are two "Smart Dual-Mode Touchpads." All this means is that each touchpad can work as either a virtual joystick or a trackpad. This is likely similar to what we've seen in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocket-dmg-pocket-micro-launch">AYANEO Pocket DMG</a>, which features one physical joystick, and then a touchpad area that doubles as the second joystick.</p><p>From there, the Pocket PLAY offers an array of other buttons, such as the standard Start+Select combination, along with a dedicated AYANEO button. However, there are a few buttons on the front, notably the red one, that we aren't exactly sure what it does.</p><p>Moving past the gaming aspect, there's a pretty good chance you won't find the Pocket PLAY being compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s26-ultra-vs-galaxy-s25-ultra">Galaxy S26 Ultra</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-17-pro-review">iPhone 17 Pro</a> once released.

For one, we don't know how much this will actually cost just yet, nor do we know whether AYANEO will be aiming for global availability. If so, that means it'll need to be certified by the FCC to be sold in the U.S., which is enough of a task on its own, especially for a start-up.</p><p>Then there's the matter of <em>when</em> the Pocket PLAY will actually be released. As evidenced by recent launches, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/android-gaming-handhelds-are-awesome-but-theres-an-ugly-side-to-the-space-that-im-tired-of-ignoring">Pocket DS</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/pocket-fit-gaming-handheld-g3-gen3-8gb-ram-128gb-storage/CZTW4GQ2LP">KONKR Pocket FIT</a>, AYANEO seems to be struggling to keep up with production. Not to mention that it keeps revealing new devices on what feels like a monthly cadence.</p><p>That being said, whenever the AYANEO Pocket PLAY is officially released, there's a pretty good chance I'll be trying to pick one up. Speaking of which, there's already a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ayaneo-offical/ayaneo-pocket-play-mobile-phone-and-gaming-handheld-in-one">Kickstarter campaign landing page</a>, which currently has more than 1,000 "followers."

It was our top tablet pick for last year, though it also had major affordability barriers upon first launching. While that shouldn't come as much of a surprise at the premium level, it's aged well as a worthy contender to the latest generation Ultra, especially due to discounts like these.</p><p>This particular deal is for the 256GB configuration of the tablet, though it's also offered in 512GB and 1TB models. The Moonstone Grey color is the only color available at the time of writing, though $400 off could be enough to help you feel better about settling, if you were wanting the Platinum Silver version.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,199.99" data-dimension48="$1,199.99" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-14-6-256gb-wi-fi-with-s-pen-moonstone-gray/J3ZYG2K8G6" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="2MsjxgsLU6hiTrvMNueEKm" name="samsung galaxy tab s10 ultra render 1000x1000.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2MsjxgsLU6hiTrvMNueEKm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra:</strong> <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-14-6-256gb-wi-fi-with-s-pen-moonstone-gray/J3ZYG2K8G6" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,199.99" data-dimension48="$1,199.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$1,199.99</del> <strong>$799.99 at Best Buy</strong></a></p><p>Those in need of a good holiday deal on a premium tablet will appreciate this $400 discount on the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra at Best Buy.

The company parades both chips around as mobile platforms with "robust performance" to level up devices with lower strength. Kicking things off is the 6s 4G Gen 2, which looks to stamp its name in the books for "dependable power."</p><p>Qualcomm states this chip features its Kyro CPU and Adreno GPU for smoother visuals and proficient multitasking. The CPU brings speeds up to 2.9GHz, alongside subtle improvements to its GPU for 20% increased graphical performance. The company states the Snapdragon 6s 4G Gen 2 supports 120fps, and it can facilitate low-lag on FHD Plus display phones.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:436px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:137.61%;"><img id="4MHWBqdxeA5UUxQ2Hc2Gy5" name="qualcomm-snapdragon-6s-4g-gen-2" alt="The Snapdragon 6s 4G Gen 2 brings concurrent multi-camera features, crisp detail to photos, and more to lower-level phones." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4MHWBqdxeA5UUxQ2Hc2Gy5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="436" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Photography is another area Qualcomm sought to make better with the 6s 4G Gen 2. The chip can support cameras up to 108MP for refined details. Additionally, users will have access to "concurrent multi-photo and video" capabilities. This means you can shoot using all three cameras at once, giving you more options before sharing.</p><p>Qualcomm's been placing more focus on AI, and the necessary means to support it, and the 6s 4G Gen 2 is no different.</p><p>The chip supports voice assistance via AI software for quicker response times when called. Moreover, Qualcomm has improved its microphone capabilities and echo cancellation to ensure voices remain on video and recordings remain crisp and undistorted.</p><h2 id="enter-the-snapdragon-4-2">Enter the Snapdragon 4</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:431px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:139.21%;"><img id="E7hzEqzbPvym6oNDDpRi8o" name="qualcomm-snapdragon-4-gen-4" alt="The Snapdragon 4 Gen 4 places a focus on improving the overall battery efficiency and graphical prowess of lower-level phones." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/E7hzEqzbPvym6oNDDpRi8o.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="431" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The second chip, the Snapdragon 4 Gen 4, sits on the same hallmarks as the 6s 4G Gen 2. Qualcomm's placed its Kryo CPU in this chip, too; however, its speeds only peak at 2.3GHz. When it comes to the Adreno GPU, smooth graphics with support for 120fps are highlighted. Such graphical promises are slated for phones with FHD Plus screens.</p><p>The chip can support phones with cameras up to 108MP, similar to the 6s 4G Gen 2. Concurrent camera capture remains the same across both chips; however, Qualcomm highlights the SD 4 Gen 4's "hardware-based multi-frame noise reduction." Through this, the company states its chip can cut out grainy results when taking photos.</p><p>While swift 5G and Wi-Fi are touted, the affordable chip lends its strength to another area: battery life. With Qualcomm's Quick Charge 4 Plus technology, the post claims the chip can bring users from 0% to 50% in roughly 15 minutes.</p><p>Qualcomm adds that the Snapdragon 6s 4G Gen 2 and the Snapdragon 4 Gen 4 have been included in its "mobile roadmap" with their sights squarely on the mid-range and entry-level markets.</p> ]]></dc:content>

According to the DHS, certain tourists will be required to "share their social media history for the past five years." The updated requirement through the ESTA will soon affect tourists from the Visa Waiver Program, travelers who can enter the United States without a visa.</p><p>In addition to social media history, Customs and Border Protection (which would enforce this) will seek any emails the person has used over the past decade, and sensitive information of the traveler's "immediate family," such as their address and contact details.</p><p>CBS News states that the Trump administration is positioning this proposed change behind weeding out "anti-American" views/activities. Moreover, it will reportedly direct those involved to "intensely probe the good moral character" of tourists from these visa-free countries. There are 42 countries involved, such as many European countries, as well as Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Chile, and more.</p><p>While the changes are yet to go into effect (there's an approval process by the White House's budget office needed), concerns are already mounting about how this will impact tourism to the U.S.</p><h2 id="concerns-are-mounting-2">Concerns are mounting</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:65.00%;"><img id="UnygaaA9Fthqda6mTcQt2j" name="instagram-facebook-whatsapp-1e7c.jpg" alt="Social apps" src="https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UnygaaA9Fthqda6mTcQt2j.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In response to the DHS notice, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/11/trump-plan-vet-us-visitors-social-media-tourism">The Guardian</a> cites a statement by the chief executive of Index on Censorship in London, Jemimah Steinfeld, who states, "The seriousness of this move should not be downplayed. Through a simple search, any posts critical of Trump and his administration could be revealed, and then what? Will admission to the USA be predicated on being nice about the president?"</p><p>It remains to be seen when these proposed changes will go into effect for travelers.</p><p>The publication also mentions that there are concerns about the impact this could have on the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

This new division of Reality Labs, launched <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-horizon-os-gets-top-level-firepower-to-combat-android-xr">just one month ago</a>, was created to cleanly split Reality Labs into more tangible business goals, and it was clearly put in place ahead of the big moves we saw in the past two weeks.</p><p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-04/meta-s-zuckerberg-plans-deep-cuts-for-metaverse-efforts" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a> report, Meta may be making 30% cuts to the division starting in January. That was enough for plenty of outlets to circle the wagons and cry that "VR is dead" once again, a mantra that far too many tech-forward publications love to scream year in and out. But the reality doesn't fit that narrative at all. In fact, reality is exactly the opposite of what these places purport.</p><p>Meta <em>just</em> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-just-stole-two-of-apples-biggest-lead-designers-and-the-implications-for-vr-smart-glasses-and-ai-are-absolutely-enormous">hired two top-tier designers from Apple</a> right before this news broke, and that news came just days after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/new-meta-quest-4-rumors-lighter-headset-2025">fresh leaks pointed toward</a> a gaming-focused, high-end Meta Quest 4 in the works. Unironically, this is all happening as CTO Andrew Bosworth's promise that 2025 will be “the work of visionaries or a legendary misadventure" is about to expire, signaling that the company's focus on Horizon Worlds as the go-to "metaverse" <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-its-time-to-kill-horizon-worlds-before-it-kills-the-meta-quest">was the problem all along</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure pull-left inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:661px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:29.95%;"><img id="shw6vroRiUxqcvWLRPZjB6" name="click-to-follow-ac-lloyd-sq-g" alt="Click to Follow Android Central on Google" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/shw6vroRiUxqcvWLRPZjB6.jpg" mos="" align="left" fullscreen="" width="661" height="198" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-left"></p></div></div></figure><p>Enjoy our content?

Since then, this division has been responsible for developing VR headsets, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses" target="_blank">smart glasses</a>, Horizon Worlds, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-semg-wristband-whitepaper">sEMG gesture bands</a>, the Horizon operating system, next-generation realistic avatars, and more.</p><p>Meta spends billions on Reality Labs technology investments each quarter, with spending growing from about $2 billion in Q4 2020 to a whopping $6.05 billion in Q4 2024. Since 2022, over 50% of Reality Labs' budget has been spent developing true AR glasses like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Meta Orion</a>, though the closest Meta has come to releasing a consumer product is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-glasses">Ray-Ban Display Glasses</a>.</p><p>Since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-cuts-employees-in-its-biggest-lay-off">the end of 2022</a>, Meta has been cutting spending in most divisions by around 10% per year to get costs under control. Because of Reality Labs' unbridled spending growth, Zuckerberg <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/meta-reality-labs-spending-cuts-by-2026/">reportedly requested</a> a 20% spending <em>cut </em>by the end of 2025. That apparently never happened.</p><p>Now, the division needs to cut spending by 30% to match the 10% annual cut plus the 20% 2025 cut that didn't happen. That's not a deep cut; that's an alignment with every other division within Meta.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Gy6tBWc4LzPPznAaFTLSjC" name="meta-quest-2-pro-3-straight.jpg" alt="The Meta Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro, and Meta Quest 3 on a table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Gy6tBWc4LzPPznAaFTLSjC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Meta isn't abandoning VR at all, far from it. But I do believe the company is making important shifts away from failed projects like Horizon Worlds and toward the development of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/meta-reportedly-pushes-the-release-of-new-mixed-reality-glasses-to-2027" target="_blank">a new pair of mixed-reality</a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/meta-reportedly-pushes-the-release-of-new-mixed-reality-glasses-to-2027"> glasses</a>. The December 4 report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-job-cuts-metaverse-reality-labs-ai-2025-12">Business Insider</a> aligns with this view, and new leaks about a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/new-meta-quest-4-rumors-lighter-headset-2025" target="_blank">gaming-focused, ultralight Meta Quest 4</a> further complete the picture of what's happening at Meta.</p><p>Now, does that mean Horizon Worlds is going away tomorrow? Absolutely not. Meta has significantly redesigned the operating system that powers the Meta Quest (called Horizon OS) to revolve around using Horizon Worlds as a central social platform. Some elements of this transition have proven to be a boon to the Quest's OS, such as easier ways to connect and chat with friends and less friction for new users.</p><p>Instead, I think Meta will now begin to focus more on game developers again as it attempts to rekindle relationships it tanked when it went all-in on Horizon Worlds integration. VR games <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/quest-developers-are-joining-forces-to-solve-the-vr-visibility-crisis">have been obscenely difficult to find</a> on the official Meta Quest store because Horizon Worlds content has been front and center for the past 15 months or so, causing real problems for developers and Meta Quest game sales.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AVJKoSUjRxT8VdcTsmYK4S" name="meta-quest-VR-prototype-holocake-2-render.jpg" alt="Meta Holocake 2 VR prototype from the side" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AVJKoSUjRxT8VdcTsmYK4S.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With all of that now in focus, it paints a much clearer picture of what Reality Labs is doing and what Meta's future products are going to look like. For now, Meta Quest headsets, along with smart glasses like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-gen-2">Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oakley-meta-hstn-smart-glasses-review">Oakley Meta HSTN</a>, are going to continue pulling in around a billion in revenue each quarter, with Meta hoping for more growth in these segments as it starts to significantly trim spending.</p><p>That's not Meta giving up on VR or "the Metaverse," as many like to purport.

U.S. customers can also find it at Verizon, Total Wireless, Straight Talk, Simple Mobile, Tracfone, Walmart Family, and Visible starting December 11, 2025.</p><p>Motorola is selling the phone for an impressively low $199, matching last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-2025-review">Moto G 2025</a> price while feeling snappier in the process. While it retains the same MediaTek Dimensity 6300 SoC and 4GB of RAM, the phone sings along with Motorola's version of Android 16, which is preinstalled when you power it on for the first time. Even though it's a budget price, Motorola is still promising two OS upgrades and three years of bi-monthly security updates, so you can use it safely for years to come.</p><p>While last year's phone marked a huge improvement in the historically lackluster Moto G line, this year's takes that up another notch with notably better everyday performance and a better camera experience. That 50MP rear camera loads quickly and takes surprisingly decent pictures. Plus, the new Pantone-certified vegan leather colors feature unique textures and colors, especially the Cattleya Orchid pink phone I have for review.</p><figure class="van-image-figure pull-left inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:661px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:29.95%;"><img id="shw6vroRiUxqcvWLRPZjB6" name="click-to-follow-ac-lloyd-sq-g" alt="Click to Follow Android Central on Google" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/shw6vroRiUxqcvWLRPZjB6.jpg" mos="" align="left" fullscreen="" width="661" height="198" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-left"></p></div></div></figure><p>Enjoy our content?

While the Mate XT is so much more than a technical showcase, Huawei still makes regular book-style foldables, and its latest model — the Mate X7 — brings a bigger battery and better cameras.</p><p>Huawei unveiled the Mate X7 in China on November 25, and introduced the foldable globally at a launch event in Dubai on December 11. The foldable will go on sale in select regions in Southeast Asia in the coming weeks, where it will cost the equivalent of €2,099 ($2,459).</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FG5FKWp9kmNx5uMyEmQjjc" name="Huawei Mate X7" alt="Huawei Mate X7 hands-on testing in Dubai on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FG5FKWp9kmNx5uMyEmQjjc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I've always liked Huawei's design aesthetic, and the Mate X7 looks similar to its predecessor.

The foldable has a great in-hand feel, and at 235g, it isn't heavy in the least; Huawei somehow managed to bring down the weight by 4g while adding a bigger battery.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="J8pJyxEPnyTNrKvkvySbkc" name="Huawei Mate X7" alt="Huawei Mate X7 hands-on testing in Dubai on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/J8pJyxEPnyTNrKvkvySbkc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'm using the red variant of the Mate X7, and it has a vegan leather back that's terrific to hold and use.

I like the in-hand feel thanks to the rounded edges and beveled sides, and the weight distribution is ideal.</p><p>The Mate X7 also gets IP58 and IP59 ingress protection, making it that much more durable — only Google delivers better protection on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold. Coming in at 4.5mm unfolded and 9.5mm folded, the Mate X7 isn't quite the thinnest foldable around, but honestly, it feels just as great to use as the Z Fold 7 or X Fold 5.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KwETKf8j8TNp5kJvt49ahc" name="Huawei Mate X7" alt="Huawei Mate X7 hands-on testing in Dubai on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KwETKf8j8TNp5kJvt49ahc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Where the X7 differentiates itself is the panel; both the 6.49-inch cover screen and the inner 8-inch OLED panels have better brightness than previous years, and it makes a genuine difference in outdoor use. Color rendition is better as well, and there's increased vibrancy. You get 120Hz refresh on either screen, and they both include 1,440Hz PWM as standard.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9ybTNWwQNa9zWqFt4tGeic" name="Huawei Mate X7" alt="Huawei Mate X7 hands-on testing in Dubai on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9ybTNWwQNa9zWqFt4tGeic.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The hinge itself has a smooth articulation and stays unfolded at various angles, and this hasn't proved to be an issue at all. Huawei has been making foldables for well over half a decade now, and continual tweaks to the hinge over the years has resulted in a lighter and better design. There is a marginal crease along the inner panel, but it isn't as evident as previous years, and with just a day of use, I don't notice it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vkQHj79sJVhEomysckUmgc" name="Huawei Mate X7" alt="Huawei Mate X7 hands-on testing in Dubai on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vkQHj79sJVhEomysckUmgc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What you will notice is the cameras. Huawei always did a great job in this area, and the Mate X7 takes things to another level. The foldable gets a new 50MP main camera and 50MP 3.5x tele lens, with both modules featuring OIS. The 40MP wide-angle lens is the same as last year.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div

I didn't see any issues in the day I used the Mate X7, and to Huawei's credit, it did a great job optimizing the foldable to the platform. But there's no denying the fact that it isn't as powerful as the Z Fold 7 or X Fold 5; I'll test how it holds up in gaming and other intensive tasks in the review.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="seZeGhKTULv4g8g2qHoShc" name="Huawei Mate X7" alt="Huawei Mate X7 hands-on testing in Dubai on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/seZeGhKTULv4g8g2qHoShc.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tXhusVBYDxPNEaUz2FqFhc" name="Huawei Mate X7" alt="Huawei Mate X7 hands-on testing in Dubai on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tXhusVBYDxPNEaUz2FqFhc.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2ovqVDbYV6moQqrYSxYHhc" name="Huawei Mate X7" alt="Huawei Mate X7 hands-on testing in Dubai on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2ovqVDbYV6moQqrYSxYHhc.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Where it does a better job is the battery; even with heavy use that involved taking hundreds of photos and a few dozen videos, the Mate X7 managed to last the entirety of the day.

It has a clean UI with plenty of usable features, and you don't see any AI-assisted utilities on the device — which in itself feels refreshing. The software build I'm using isn't final, and while Huawei's devices don't include the Play Store, the brand lets you pre-install MicroG and GBox while setting up the Mate X7, and that makes it easier than ever to then sideload the Play Store and install all the Google services you use.</p><p>I'm just getting started with the Mate X7, and will have more to share on the phone over the coming weeks. There's clearly a lot to like with the foldable, and Huawei isn't letting trade limitations come in the way of delivering a fabulous overall device.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Anyone in the U.S. can sign up for early access and get an invitation within a day starting Wednesday, Dec. 10.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.googlenestcommunity.com/t5/Blog/Expanding-early-access-to-the-Gemini-for-Home-voice-experience/ba-p/771970" target="_blank">Google Nest community post</a>, Google says it is "going to start sending out invitations more rapidly." Additionally, any Google Home user with a U.S. address can sign up for the Gemini for Home early access program and get invited within 24 hours. Users can sign up for early access by opening the <strong>Google Home app</strong>, tapping their <strong>Google Account profile picture</strong>, pressing <strong>Home settings</strong>, and tapping <strong>Early Access</strong>.</p><p>In the past, Google tested new features through the Public Preview program for the Google Home app. This time, the Gemini for Home rollout has its own early access program, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/this-gemini-for-home-hack-lets-you-hear-the-new-assistant-early-with-a-catch">it has been very limited</a>. That is, until now. If you've been eager to get Gemini on your Google Home and Nest products, now is your chance.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2i6tu6nKuChmFRbMtTsqPg" name="Google-Home-app-redesign" alt="The Google Home app for Android updated as of October 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2i6tu6nKuChmFRbMtTsqPg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Gemini is available on every Google Home or Nest smart speaker and display released since 2016. The full experience, including Gemini Live support, is coming to the Google Nest Hub (2nd-gen), Nest Audio, Nest Mini (2nd-gen), and Nest Hub Max. The basic Gemini experience without Live is available on Nest Wi-Fi, Nest Hub (1st-gen), Home Max, Home Mini (1st-gen), Google Home, and third-party speakers.</p><p>Notably, this is the first time Google has confirmed Gemini will replace Assistant even on third-party hardware.

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The next innovation in the phone industry is tri-folding devices, and Samsung is unveiling its efforts in this category with the Galaxy Z TriFold, which is slated to hit the U.S. in Q1 2026. While Samsung still doesn't have review units to give out to the media, it is selling the tri-fold in South Korea and the UAE. Incidentally, I'm in the UAE this week, and I was able to go hands-on with the Galaxy Z TriFold at the Dubai Mall, where Samsung is showcasing the foldable and taking pre-registrations ahead of the sale later this month.</p><p>As someone who used <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-is-the-most-exciting-phone-around">Huawei's Mate XT</a> for the better part of the year, I was excited to get my hands on the Galaxy Z TriFold, and while I used it in a demo setting, the device is nothing short of incredible.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oXYnF9FoswnR2ANM367cHQ" name="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold hands-on testing at Dubai Mall on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oXYnF9FoswnR2ANM367cHQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Galaxy Z TriFold feels like an oversized model of the Galaxy Z Fold 7, and that's a good thing; it has the same svelte design, and while it is thicker when folded because of the increased real estate, it is just as thin at 4.2mm when you unfold it to the full 10 inches.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CZBYeHz5XDZ9eGBjSwxuGQ" name="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold hands-on testing at Dubai Mall on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CZBYeHz5XDZ9eGBjSwxuGQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On that note, the Galaxy Z TriFold doesn't feel flimsy in the least; the hinges are just as smooth to articulate, and it feels great to hold in-hand when unfolded — it's basically a tablet that you can take anywhere. There's no visible crease either, and that makes a genuine difference.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HsqTCvrxkFaZ4QAipEebHQ" name="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold hands-on testing at Dubai Mall on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HsqTCvrxkFaZ4QAipEebHQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Galaxy Z TriFold may not have the biggest panel — the Mate XT goes up to 10.2-inch — but Samsung did an arguably better job with the inner and cover panels. Both panels go up to 120Hz (instead of 90Hz on the Mate XT), and they get brighter. Although it isn't using the latest Qualcomm silicon, the Snapdragon 8 Elite has plenty of power, and this isn't going to be a limiting factor in the least.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qov5DgfnEt4So3yJYemZHQ" name="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold hands-on testing at Dubai Mall on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qov5DgfnEt4So3yJYemZHQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another point of differentiation is that the Galaxy Z TriFold gets a similar 200MP module as the Z Fold 7, so it should take decent photos — not that I was able to test it in the limited time I used the tri-folding device. The Kevlar texture on the rear feels great, and is different to what you get on other Galaxy Z devices.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="njnhBJECn9NxnnRAELRxGQ" name="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold hands-on testing at Dubai Mall on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/njnhBJECn9NxnnRAELRxGQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung went with an interesting design choice where the cover screen is sandwiched between the two sections that fold in, so when you're holding the device unfolded, your fingers inevitably come into contact with the cover panel, and it gets coated in smudges without any effort (as you can see in the photo above).</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7CC2bwUqpqPKmJbznwSyGQ" name="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold hands-on testing at Dubai Mall on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7CC2bwUqpqPKmJbznwSyGQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>But what's even more egregious is that the Galaxy Z TriFold isn't as versatile as the Mate XT. You can use it in just two configurations: the tablet-sized 10-inch inner panel, and the 6.5-inch cover panel. There's no way to use it as a traditional book-style foldable — unlike the Mate XT. This is annoying to say the least, as I use my Mate XT regularly with one section closed, and the 7.9-inch size comes in handy.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="T2hV9GjZypdL7Kr3CL4yGQ" name="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold hands-on testing at Dubai Mall on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/T2hV9GjZypdL7Kr3CL4yGQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With Samsung, you don't have that choice. The touch layer shuts down when you close one of the folding panels, and there's even a correct way to close the foldable. You'll need to fold the left panel, and then the right. If you mistakenly close the right panel, you immediately get an alert.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GYGSigR9byuags95qRrUEQ" name="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold hands-on testing at Dubai Mall on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GYGSigR9byuags95qRrUEQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Why is this, you ask? It's because the Galaxy Z TriFold's outer sections close inward, and the rear of the right panel houses the camera island. The U-styled design of the outer panel is fundamentally different to Huawei's Z-style design, and while it means the outer panel isn't at risk of taking damage, it is limited to one configuration.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TX8uHpF57iqEJFViw5CgEQ" name="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold hands-on testing at Dubai Mall on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TX8uHpF57iqEJFViw5CgEQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Out of the two tri-folding devices, I prefer Huawei's design better. I like the versatility of having three devices in one, and I don't like the positioning of the cover panel on the Z TriFold — it comes in the way too much when using the inner panel. That said, there's no arguing that the Z TriFold has better durability; it even gets IP48 ingress protection.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BKzZgQjzDX32QuyKAN7tGQ" name="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold hands-on testing at Dubai Mall on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BKzZgQjzDX32QuyKAN7tGQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung also does a great job with software, and the little I used of the Z TriFold was enough to see that it's similar to the Z Fold 7 in this regard. While I can only talk about battery life once I get my hands on a review unit, it's good to see Samsung going with a 5,600mAh unit on the device — its biggest battery on a Samsung phone yet.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2KiAryXnzDMUtCsz9EWQEQ" name="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold hands-on testing at Dubai Mall on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2KiAryXnzDMUtCsz9EWQEQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Foldables are close to an inflection point; the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x-fold-5-review">Vivo X Fold 5</a> are just 4.2mm thick, and there really isn't much more than can be done with the design before limitations with the physical thickness of the USB-C port become a factor.</p><p>It's no wonder, then, that brands are now turning to new form factors. Huawei proved it can deliver a tri-folding device in the Mate XT, and while I thought it would be akin to the early wave of book-style foldables that debuted seven years ago, it was astonishingly easy to use — and durable. It held up to close to a year of use without any problems whatsoever.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="mNX9nRSfbGsqp3mqHtPcHQ" name="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold hands-on testing at Dubai Mall on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mNX9nRSfbGsqp3mqHtPcHQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Overall, the Galaxy Z TriFold is a bold new vision for Samsung, and it's evident that the brand is testing the waters with the device. Samsung only plans to have 500 units of the tri-folding device on sale in the UAE, and it's likely that it will be the case in other countries where it will go on sale in 2026. Considering the foldable costs well over $3,000, it's understandable that Samsung isn't manufacturing it in bulk, but even then, it's good to see a legitimate rival to the Huawei Mate XT.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The tipster claims that the phone's specifications (at least, what was listed) have been "certified" recently for the Verizon Network ahead of its launch. With that, the Pixel 10a is allegedly preparing to support 5G network connectivity, as well as a ~6.3-inch FHD Plus display.</p><p>The supposed listing then hits a few more "key" areas, like its camera, which could feature a 48MP wide-angle main lens.</p><p>This could be joined by a 13MP ultra-wide camera to round out its dual-array, leaving the display to house a 13MP selfie lens. For its battery, the tipster alleges a 5,100mAh capacity. The leaks end by claiming the Pixel 10a's RAM/storage might truly walk that affordable line with an 8/128GB configuration.</p><p>Aside from the alleged certification, no launch details were speculated; however, there's one important note with these specifications: we've seen them before.</p><h2 id="2"></h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Look what just got certified for use on Verizon's network. pic.twitter.com/OS5mTa9Zg5<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1998673588740563151">December 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>The tipster's leak has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/caschy/status/1998677122689143061">spurred some discussions on X</a> with users, as some have noticed how similar they are to the Pixel 9a. This is true, as the Pixel 9a also featured a 6.3-inch display with a 48MP main camera lens, a 5,100mAh battery, and an 8/128GB configuration. It's probably not <em>too </em>strange, considering the true changes will likely come via its software—and its chip of choice. While users on X speculate that Google could pack the Tensor G4 in the Pixel 10a once again.</p><p>The device's specs aren't the only thing looking same-same, as earlier rumors suggest the Pixel 10a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10a-surfaces-in-a-new-leak-with-a-nearly-identical-to-pixel-9a">could even keep the design going</a>. A rendering leak from earlier this year showed off the new A-series Pixel with the same design as the Pixel 9a. That is with a dual camera array that's flush to its back panel and slightly thinner bezels.</p><p>The phone's chip has continued <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/looks-like-the-google-pixel-10a-might-be-a-total-snooze-fest">to be an object of discussion</a>, as even older rumors from September theorize that Google could place the exact same Tensor G4 in the 10a. However, rumors have gone back and forth on this, with some suggesting a "boosted" version, while others say it'll be a "downgraded" variant. Either way, it looks like we'll have to wait until next year to see what's really going down.</p> ]]></dc:content>

These new plans aren't set to kick off until "early 2026," per the post; however, it's teasing what's to come by revealing the contents of its YouTube TV Sports Plan. In this, consumers are set to receive access to major sports broadcasters through its service, such as NBC Sports Network and FS1.</p><p>The platform states this plan will also include "all" ESPN Networks and ESPN Unlimited.</p><p>While the aforementioned broadcasters and services are the meat and potatoes of the Sports Plan, YouTube TV says it will provide a few add-ons, as well. If you're looking for more, consumers can add the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv-fantasy-custom-multiview-nfl-sunday-ticket">NFL Sunday Ticket</a> and RedZone to the Sports Plan for even more NFL action, likely in preparation for the 2026-2027 season next September. Multiview, unlimited DVR, and more will be included.</p><p>As YouTube TV stated, the goal of these new "plans" is to give users the ability to tailor their viewing experience. The platform plans to expand this with 10 genre-specific packages next year. This Sports Plan is just one of them, as the post teases the consumer's ability to combine sports and news, focus on family entertainment, focus on sports, or anything else that grabs your attention.</p><h2 id="this-could-ve-been-different-and-it-probably-is-2">This could've been different, and it probably is</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="isjGcKtXArcr87cxJ9vkua" name="YouTube-TV-Disney-Plus-apps" alt="YouTube TV and Disney Plus apps" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/isjGcKtXArcr87cxJ9vkua.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's hard to gloss over what's transpired between YouTube TV and Disney (after that whole <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv/youtube-tv-may-lose-espn-abc-as-disney-delivers-a-stern-warning">negotiation battle</a>), as ESPN is a major part of this Sports Plan. While talks have concluded positively for the viewer, there was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv/youtube-tvs-espn-unlimited-win-has-one-major-catch-for-baseball-fans">a huge catch for baseball fans</a>: the MLB.TV package is gone. YouTube TV is allowed to keep ESPN after settling with Disney, but a strong catalyst for viewing baseball games was excluded.</p><p>The MLB.TV package is headed into the ESPN app next year; however, this integration removes its offering from third parties, like YouTube TV. The new rights agreement with MLB gives ESPN full control over out-of-market games.</p><p>If things went differently, perhaps MLB.TV would've been included in YouTube TV's Sports Plan, but who knows. It's also quite timely that YouTube TV has announced this Sports Plan (and its new plans in general), considering it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv/disneys-channels-return-to-youtube-tv-after-intense-negotiations">Disney's channels returned</a> roughly a month ago.</p><p>After two long weeks, the two finally reached an agreement, bringing back 21 channels to consumers who were growing tired of the back and forth.</p> ]]></dc:content>

According to Mosseri, this will let users "see and control" what content is produced for them in Reels. Instagram reportedly leverages its AI software to show users what it believes they're interested in. If you're ever wondering<em> why </em>you're seeing the Reels you are, this will give you the insight you need.</p><p>In Mosseri's video, he explains that users can head into "Your Algorithm" and fine-tune this as needed.</p><p>This feature is rolling out today (Dec 10) for the U.S., and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/reels-algorithm-control">a subsequent blog post</a> went further, detailing more. When in Reels, users will soon notice an icon at the top right (it looks like two hearts on separate tracks). From there, you can see "Your Algorithm," a quick overview of what Instagram's AI believes you like to see. Users will notice two important categories: "what you want to see more of" and "what you want to see less of."</p><p>The former includes everything the AI already thinks you like, and you can add or subtract topics from there. The latter, what you want less of, is for topics you don't want to see while scrolling through Reels. The recommendations Instagram gives you will "adapt" to whatever you've set in Your Algorithm. Lastly, the post states users can "share" their interests, which is the short AI-generated blurb that sums it all up.</p><p>Mosseri adds that there's interest in a "world where there's transparency and control" with what the user sees on Instagram.</p><h2 id="it-s-your-algorithm-2">It's your algorithm</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1091px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.00%;"><img id="cVJ7EzT8sxxLZsu9TpdeQh" name="instagram-your-algorithm-announced" alt="Instagram rolls out "Your Algorithm" for users to see and even alter what its AI software thinks they're interested in, for an app that shows exactly what they want." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cVJ7EzT8sxxLZsu9TpdeQh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1091" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This is just the beginning for Instagram. Mosseri's announcement post adds that while Reels is the first, there's work to be done to bring "Your Algorithm" to the main Instagram feed and the search tab. The inclusion of the search tab is said to specifically show things you've added.</p><p>U.S. users are the first to receive this in Reels today; however, the company is already looking to bring it to more English speakers globally "soon."</p><p>Instagram's AI has been busy recently, as the platform started leaning <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/instagrams-ai-now-detects-and-protects-teens-even-if-their-profile-says-theyre-adults">on its software to identify teen users</a>. The purpose is to help activate its teen-focused protections for younger users on the platform. It was stated that the AI would flag underage users even if their birthdays claim they're an adult. If flagged, Instagram's Teen Account settings will be automatically applied, closing off who can contact them and controlling the content they see.</p><div class="instagram-embed"><blockquote class="instagram-media"  data-instgrm-version="6" style="width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);"><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DSFa4TvEgUU/" target="_blank">A post shared by Adam Mosseri (@mosseri)</a></p><p>A photo posted by  on </p></blockquote></div> ]]></dc:content>

Several long-running fitness programs are being pulled as Samsung prepares to roll out a new version of the app.</p><p>As first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-health-lose-some-content-with-new-version-app/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>, the tech giant is releasing a new update this December that not only adds features but also removes some existing ones. The company has started notifying Samsung Health users that specific content within the Fitness tab is on the chopping block.</p><p>The company hasn’t offered a warm explanation, but the move aligns with Samsung’s gradual pivot toward streamlined Health integrations across <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Galaxy phones</a> and Galaxy Watches, as well as upcoming AI-driven features.</p><p>As a result, most of the content being removed is older material and downloadable files. Notices to users say the new Samsung Health app, coming this month, will stop offering "programs offered through downloads" in the Fitness Program section.</p><p>Also, any programs uploaded before December 31, 2022, will be removed from the service. This points to a major cleanup, as Samsung clears out old data to make space for new, likely cloud-based features.</p><p>Don’t worry about losing all your favorite routines. The notice makes it clear that content available for real-time streaming will stay. If you use the newer streaming classes from Samsung’s partners, those will still be there.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:406px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:214.29%;"><img id="FB5XE7mASvbahSqpE2JvUb" name="Samsung-Health-app-notification" alt="notification in the Samsung Health app about the removal of downloadable content services" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FB5XE7mASvbahSqpE2JvUb.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="406" height="870" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:406px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:214.29%;"><img id="YEhsp4a9UXtVMBqf9DnNVb" name="Samsung-Health-app-notification" alt="notification in the Samsung Health app about the removal of downloadable content services" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YEhsp4a9UXtVMBqf9DnNVb.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="406" height="870" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><h2 id="why-this-is-happening-now-2">Why this is happening now</h2><p>This update is happening alongside the launch of One UI 8.5, Samsung’s latest software version.

I'm talking about RAM (Random Access Memory), which is used to store data for processes running right now, not for storage like a hard drive. Some need more memory than others.</p><p>The data centers that power AI (including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/tech-talk-what-phone-hardware-does-it-take-for-good-fast-ai">tiny one that lives inside your phone</a>) are <em>especially</em> hungry for memory. They need it to store parts of a solution in progress while the rest is being calculated, as well as to prefetch data from storage that a piece of AI software might need fast access to. That's why the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> have so much RAM inside them now. They need it.</p><p>Turns out AI data centers are demanding so much memory that some manufacturers are even leaving the consumer business to focus on the giant orders that can make a lot more profit. Google might only need 12GB of memory to make a phone, but it needs hundreds of megabytes for every <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-carbon-capture-initiative-a-savior-or-a-smokescreen">data center server</a>. It makes sense for companies to try to supply bigger clients.</p><p>The problem is that this is not the same type or configuration of RAM used in things like a phone or even a consumer PC.  Semiconductor suppliers have to focus on what's profitable.</p><h2 id="supply-and-demand-2">Supply and demand</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="XB3dqe5yoQBH2eooh6WDhR" name="Ultrahuman-factory-tour-quality-control-scan" alt="An Ultrahuman factory worker sits at a station for examining the external components of a Ring Air for defects." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XB3dqe5yoQBH2eooh6WDhR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Everyone still wants or needs a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">smartphone</a>. That's never going to change unless technology advances to a point where something else can tackle everything your smartphone can do.</p><p>Let's use some easy numbers for an example here. There are 100 people who want to buy a new phone. There are 500 data center computers that need memory. A semiconductor manufacturer can only make 500 products in total.</p><p>Existing contracts say it has to supply a phone maker with 85 modules. It's going to fulfill that contract, then focus on the data center orders because they are more profitable. It's also going to raise prices because the entire company has to work harder to fulfill <strong>every</strong> order, so component prices are going to increase.</p><p>Your favorite phone maker can only make 85 of the phones it wants to sell; those cost more to manufacture, and since fewer are made than customers want to buy, demand will be high.</p><p>In the end, you will pay more.</p><p>A substantial amount more, according to companies like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://counterpointresearch.com/en/insights/advanced-memory-prices-likely-to-double-as-dram-crunch-spreads-on-nvidia-pivot-structural-factors">Counterpoint Research</a>, which says that memory prices will climb another 30% in the last part of 2025 and an additional 20% early next year. If the memory inside your next phone costs 50% more, that's going to lead to a noticeable price increase. You know the consumer is <em><strong>always</strong></em> the one who pays price increases in the end.</p><p>Some, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS53965725">IDC, </a>claim this will affect sales, and demand is expected to decrease in 2026. That makes sense; fewer people will buy a new phone if it's too expensive and their current phone still works.</p><p>Unfortunately, cheaper budget models will be hit the hardest because there just isn;t a lot of pre-built profit margin in them. According to IDC, "<em>the average selling price for smartphones is expected to climb to $465 in 2026, compared to $457 in 2025,  putting the smartphone market at a record high value of $578.9 billion</em>."</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">Cheap Android phones</a> are consumer staples. Enthusiasts are fine with paying upwards of $1,000 or more for the latest and greatest, but for most people, that's overkill. A good, cheap Android phone will do everything you need a smartphone to do, it just lacks a few bells and whistles. Starting at the tail end of this year, those phones won't be as cheap because they cost more to make. For there to be any profit in manufacturing an inexpensive phone, prices have to rise to account for it.</p><h2 id="i-think-this-will-only-get-worse-2">I think this will only get worse</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="DeUXUdZ4RHNJfzA6Mh79VY" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Fold-4-deals-money-01.jpg" alt="A Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4 with US dollars" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DeUXUdZ4RHNJfzA6Mh79VY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The thirst for AI is unlikely to diminish in 2026. We're also unlikely to see any new companies with the capacity to manufacture millions of DRAM modules spring up in just a year.</p><p>I'm betting prices will keep climbing as demand grows. A small decrease in smartphone shipments won't make much of a difference. Companies like Google, Microsoft, and Nvidia are going to keep spending trillions on new data centers until they have a reason to stop, which isn't likely to happen in just a year.</p><p>And we can't lay the blame on any one thing. It's hard to build data servers and equally hard to fabricate memory for them all. It's easy to hate AI for this, but there is demand for the useful things it can do now and in the foreseeable future. Things like medical research or safer aircraft, not just for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-galaxy-ai-generative-edit">fixing your blurry pictures</a>.</p><p>That doesn't change any of it, though, and we should expect phone prices to climb until they reach a point where we stop buying them. Are you willing to give up using a smartphone because it costs $100 more than it did when you last bought one? How about $200? Or are you going to use what you have for another year and grumble when the time to buy finally arrives?</p><p>I know that I'm going to try and shop smarter and be a little more frugal because of rising prices, and I expect many of you to feel the same way.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Earlier this year, Google rolled out a feature that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-just-made-it-easier-to-see-stories-from-sites-you-trust">allowed users to mark their favorite news</a> outlets and publications as Preferred Sources, so they would appear higher in search results when users looked up trending topics.</p><p>The feature was originally limited to the United States and India. Today, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/search/tools-partnerships-web-ecosystem/">announced</a> that it's expanding Preferred Sources to all English-language users starting this week and to all languages early next year. The company says that when someone marks an outlet as a Preferred Source, they tend to click that site twice as much on average, so now more users will benefit from this feature.</p><p>By the way, if you love Android Central's coverage, you can easily mark us as a Preferred Source in Google by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=androidcentral.com">clicking this link</a>.</p><h2 id="preferred-sources-expand-to-all-english-language-users-2">Preferred Sources expand to all English language users</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XsQsjJWTb9jswCPgdmAXx5" name="google-ai-mode-contextual-results" alt="Contextual text section in AI Mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XsQsjJWTb9jswCPgdmAXx5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In addition to this, Google will start surfacing the websites you're paying for more often across Gemini, AI Mode, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-ai-overviews-led-users-astray-some-phone-numbers-are-scams-report">AI Overviews</a>. The company says it's rolling out a new feature that highlights links from your paid subscriptions, making them easier to spot when you're using AI Mode or asking Gemini about a trending topic.</p><p>Google has also been criticized for reducing users' clicks to websites they used to visit but now rely on AI Mode for. To address this, the company is rolling out an update that will more prominently highlight links to the web in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-just-made-searching-on-mobile-a-lot-more-chatty">AI Mode</a>. Google says it's launching updates to how links appear in AI Mode so users can interact with those pages more easily. You'll also start seeing more inline links.</p><p>In simple terms, with these updates, Google is giving users more control over how they consume news and from which sources while also helping ensure those outlets see more engagement, even if you primarily use AI Mode to stay informed.</p> ]]></dc:content>

A little over six years later, the South Korean behemoth has done it again with the (somewhat) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/its-official-samsungs-galaxy-z-trifold-launch">surprising unveiling</a> of the Galaxy Z Trifold. Samsung's first dual-hinge foldable, the Galaxy Z TriFold, represents the next evolution of the foldable form factor. While it's not the first device of its kind (that honor belongs to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-is-the-most-exciting-phone-around">Huawei's Mate XT</a>), it's undoubtedly the first that'll be available in multiple regions around the globe.</p><p>That's all very exciting, but just how big of an upgrade is it over the Galaxy Z Fold 7? Does it really make sense to get a first-generation product just for a bigger screen (and a few other improvements), or should you buy the Galaxy Z Fold 7, which has been perfected over the years and is arguably the finest dual-screen flagship smartphone currently available out there?</p><p>Let's take a speculative look at Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold vs. Galaxy Fold 7 and see how the chaebol's two heavyweights stack up against each other.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-vs-galaxy-z-fold-7-design-displays-and-hardware-2">Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold vs. Galaxy Z Fold 7: Design, displays, and hardware</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rd8TgnBpGtECzUiS7iix5J" name="samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-7" alt="Two Galaxy Z TriFolds next to each other" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rd8TgnBpGtECzUiS7iix5J.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Galaxy Z TriFold and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> share many similarities in their overall design, to the point that the two are nearly indistinguishable when folded. Both have the same boxy yet sturdy construction with flat sides, an 'Armor Aluminum' frame, and a 6.5-inch Dynamic AMOLED LTPO cover display that's secured by a layer of Corning's Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2.</p><p>The triple-lens primary camera setup is also the same on both foldables, with the three lenses housed inside a vertical pill-shaped island. The Galaxy Z TriFold comes with a 'ceramic-glass fiber reinforced polymer' back that Samsung claims is more resistant to cracks, although we don't know (yet) how durable it is when compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/corning-gorilla-glass-victus-2">Gorilla Glass Victus 2</a> rear of the Galaxy Z Fold 7. You also get an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-waterproof">IP48 certification</a> with both smartphones for dust and water resistance.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4710px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="HrjiJTBsqCCTWYUXcbaxXf" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-deck-ledge-angled" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 bridge angled view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HrjiJTBsqCCTWYUXcbaxXf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4710" height="2649" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Coming to weight and dimensions (when closed), the Galaxy Z TriFold is quite a bit heavier and thicker than the Galaxy Z Fold 7, which is to be expected. However, once you open those two inward-folding side panels, you realize just how impossibly slim Samsung's freshest foldable is. Due to each of its three panels varying slightly in their thickness, the TriFold measures just 3.9mm at its thinnest point. That is plain bonkers, even if the Fold 7 with its 4.2mm thickness is no less impressive!</p><p>That being said, the biggest highlight (quite literally!) of the Galaxy Z TriFold is its gargantuan 10-inch inner display. Although it comes with a lower pixel density and peak brightness than the 8-inch inner screen of the Galaxy Z Fold 7, the larger panel gives you a lot more visual real estate for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/best-android-multitasking-ui-ranked">split-view multitasking</a>, multimedia consumption, gaming, and just about everything else.</p><div ><table><caption>Specifications</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions (Closed)</p></td><td  ><p>159.2 x 75.0 x 12.9 mm</p></td><td  ><p>158.4 x 72.8 x 8.9 mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions (Opened)</p></td><td  ><p>159.2 x 214.1 x 3.9-4.2 mm</p></td><td  ><p>158.4 x 143.2 x 4.2 mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Durability & Case Material(s)</p></td><td  ><p>IP48 rating for dust and water resistance, Corning Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 (Cover), Ceramic-Glass Fiber-Reinforced Polymer (Back), Armor Aluminum Frame</p></td><td  ><p>IP48 rating for dust and water resistance, Corning Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 (Cover), Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 (Back), Armor Aluminum Frame</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>309g</p></td><td  ><p>215g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display (Inner)</p></td><td  ><p>10.0-inch Dynamic AMOLED (1584x2160 pixels resolution), LTPO, 120Hz variable refresh rate</p></td><td  ><p>8.0-inch Dynamic AMOLED (1968x2184 pixels resolution), LTPO, 120Hz variable refresh rate</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display (Outer)</p></td><td  ><p>6.5-inch Dynamic AMOLED (1080x2520 pixels resolution), LTPO, 120Hz variable refresh rate</p></td><td  ><p>6.5-inch Dynamic AMOLED (1080x2520 pixels resolution), LTPO, 120Hz variable refresh rate</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Chipset / SoC</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite (for Galaxy)</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite (for Galaxy)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>16GB</p></td><td  ><p>12GB/16GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>512GB/1TB</p></td><td  ><p>256GB/512GB/1TB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Sensors</p></td><td  ><p>Capacitive side-mounted fingerprint sensor, Accelerometer, Barometer, Gyroscope, Geomagnetic sensor, Hall sensor, Proximity sensor, Ambient light sensor</p></td><td  ><p>Capacitive side-mounted fingerprint sensor, Accelerometer, Barometer, Gyroscope, Geomagnetic sensor, Hall sensor, Proximity sensor, Ambient light sensor</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Wireless Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, 5G (mmWave and Sub-6), LTE, Bluetooth 5.4, GPS, NFC, and USB 3.2 (with DisplayPort)</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, 5G (mmWave and Sub-6), LTE, Bluetooth 5.4, GPS, NFC, and USB 3.2 (with DisplayPort)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Other Features</p></td><td  ><p>Dual-SIM/Multi-eSIM, Knox Vault, Samsung DeX standalone, Galaxy AI</p></td><td  ><p>Dual-SIM/Multi-eSIM, Knox Vault, Samsung DeX experience, Galaxy AI</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery & Charging</p></td><td  ><p>5,600mAh (Li-Ion), 45W (wired) and 15W (wireless) charging, reverse wireless charging</p></td><td  ><p>4,400mAh (Li-Ion), 25W (wired) and 15W (wireless) charging, reverse wireless charging</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Cameras (Rear)</p></td><td  ><p>200MP wide-angle, 10MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom, 12MP ultrawide | 8K video recording</p></td><td  ><p>200MP wide-angle, 10MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom, 12MP ultrawide | 8K video recording</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Cameras (Front)</p></td><td  ><p>10MP + 10MP | 4K video recording</p></td><td  ><p>10MP + 10MP | 4K video recording</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS & Update Policy</p></td><td  ><p>Android 16 with One UI 8 (preinstalled), seven years of OS and security updates</p></td><td  ><p>Android 16 with One UI 8 (preinstalled), seven years of OS and security updates</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Color Options</p></td><td  ><p>Crafted Black</p></td><td  ><p>Blue Shadow, Silver Shadow, Jetblack, and Mint (online-exclusive)</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Driven by a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> (for Galaxy) chipset, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is a powerhouse that can make quick work of just about anything you throw at it, something that Android Central's Andrew Myrick <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">noted in his review</a>.

You get a 200MP wide-angle primary sensor, a 10MP telephoto module with 3x optical zoom, and a 12MP ultrawide unit, complete with usual goodies such as optical image stabilization, up to 8K video recording, and more shooting modes than you can shake a stick at. Photos and videos pack plenty of detail, with colors and contrast levels on point.</p><p>The Galaxy Z TriFold should deliver equally stellar performance, as the foldable carries over the same primary camera array with no changes.

Then you have the standalone DeX support, which means you no longer need to connect the phone to a monitor to get a desktop-like experience.</p><p>Thanks to its larger 16:11 aspect-ratio inner display, the Galaxy Z TriFold can double as a monitor whenever you want. In summation, this phone-tablet hybrid is the ideal device for on-the-go productivity.

Representing a huge leap in mobile computing, it's a premium hybrid that lets you not just consume content but also create it.</p><p>But even with all that, it's still a first-generation product. Moreover, it's likely to cost a fortune at launch, even if Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-galaxy-z-trifold-might-cost-way-less-than-expected-leaker-claims" target="_blank">prices</a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-galaxy-z-trifold-might-cost-way-less-than-expected-leaker-claims"> it conservatively</a>. The Galaxy Fold 7 isn't exactly cheap either, but it's a far more refined foldable that doesn't have a lot of compromises. So, which one should you get?</p><p>The answer depends on what you really use your smartphone for, and of course, your budget. If you're a casual user who sometimes wants to have access to a bigger screen for things like watching videos and editing a document or two, the Galaxy Fold 7 is the right choice. It's still one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> (regardless of form factor) in the business and has just about everything you could want from a flagship.</p><p>On the other hand, if you're often juggling multiple devices (e.g., a tablet and a laptop) on the go and want to streamline your workflow a bit, the Galaxy Z TriFold might just help you do so.

While these are certainly the best pair Viture has made to date, a few missing features are holding them back from true greatness.</p><p>But before we jump into that, let's go over what Viture Luma Ultra is and how it's different from the rest of Viture's crowded smart glasses lineup. In summary, Luma Ultra upgrades the Luma Pro experience by adding a brighter display, two additional cameras, and 6DoF tracking. Viture launched its Luma series first with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/vitures-new-luma-glasses-are-incredible-and-this-viture-prime-day-sale-is-impossible-to-resist">Viture Luma Pro back in July</a>, marking the first pair of smart glasses from the company to ship with a built-in camera.</p><figure class="van-image-figure pull-left inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:661px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:29.95%;"><img id="shw6vroRiUxqcvWLRPZjB6" name="click-to-follow-ac-lloyd-sq-g" alt="Click to Follow Android Central on Google" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/shw6vroRiUxqcvWLRPZjB6.jpg" mos="" align="left" fullscreen="" width="661" height="198" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-left"></p></div></div></figure><p>Enjoy our content? Make sure to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=androidcentral.com" target="_blank"><strong>set Android Central as a preferred source</strong></a> in Google Search, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should"><strong>find out why you should</strong></a> so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>Viture Luma Ultra upgrades the experience with three total cameras: one in the nose bridge and two on the outer sides of each lens. This enables Viture Luma Ultra to provide full 6DoF spatial tracking, so virtual screens float in place no matter how much you move or walk around. The trick is that you have to use Viture's Spacewalker software to make 6DoF work.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="39x9WVRarhwDHjaZdyssbB" name="viture-luma-ultra-wearing-02" alt="Wearing Viture Luma Ultra smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/39x9WVRarhwDHjaZdyssbB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In this way, it feels like Viture is still stuck in the past, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-one-review">Xreal One</a> can do 6DoF with <em>any</em> device that outputs video, no software required. You need the extra Xreal Eye camera on those glasses, but the final cost is still less than Viture Luma Pro, making it tough to recommend Luma Pro if you're just going for a straight plug-and-play pair of smart display glasses.</p><p>This plug-and-play nature makes Xreal One a better recommendation for nearly anyone, though some folks may prefer Viture for a few reasons. Viture Luma Pro sports the brightest Sony micro-OLED displays on the market, with up to 1500 nits of DC-dimmed brightness (no PWM). That's great for specific scenarios where the automatic lens tinting isn't enough to offset bright environmental light, but I haven't found a scenario in my personal life where this is needed.</p><p>Viture's Spacewalker software is also substantially more full-featured than anything Xreal offers, so while Xreal One is a better plug-and-play pair, Viture Luma Pro offers more options for power users through the smartphone or PC/Mac apps, like quick shortcuts and multiple tracked windows. That makes it feel more like a VR headset because of the capability.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div

around with but is mostly relegated to the company's own tech demos and short games for now. I wouldn't buy the glasses for this feature, even if it turned out to be cool.</p><p>The real reason for buying Viture over the competition is twofold: automatic 3D videos and wide ecosystem compatibility. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/VITURE-Compatible-PlayStation-Supports-Handheld/dp/B0D3LT6BJW/">Viture's Pro Mobile Dock</a> makes it possible to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/i-found-smart-glasses-that-work-perfectly-on-the-nintendo-switch-2-and-all-your-favorite-systems">use these glasses with a Switch 2</a>, something <em>no other smart glasses brand</em> can claim, thanks to Nintendo's infamous hardware lockdowns. Xreal should soon have an answer to this with the Xreal Neo adapter, but that isn't available yet and doesn't have an official release date.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="gTE2qJktBmR7iSGuJFd5if" name="viture-luma-pro-front-center-camera" alt="Viture Luma Pro's single camera" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gTE2qJktBmR7iSGuJFd5if.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="FDxfBm9jJrqimU4RDGWmgf" name="viture-luma-ultra-cameras-01" alt="Viture Luma Ultra's side cameras" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FDxfBm9jJrqimU4RDGWmgf.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="AJa2Ls2R335RZomHVYJGhf" name="viture-luma-ultra-diopter-adjustment-wheels-01" alt="Viture Luma Ultra diopter adjustments" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AJa2Ls2R335RZomHVYJGhf.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9zvRFso8LEHvLqJLNt9gif" name="viture-luma-ultra-front-center-camera" alt="Viture Luma Ultra's center camera" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9zvRFso8LEHvLqJLNt9gif.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="hHvVXXuvcvoShSAEvYpYif" name="viture-luma-ultra-with-box-01" alt="Viture Luma Ultra smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hHvVXXuvcvoShSAEvYpYif.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The other reason to get them is Viture's Immersive 3D video, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/viture-immersive-3d-video">which I tested a few months ago</a> and found to be utter voodoo magic. Viture's Spacewalker app automatically converts <strong>any</strong> video to 3D using onboard AI processing, and it works almost flawlessly. The UI is a bit clunky at times, but nothing else on the market offers this functionality, and it's phenomenal for anyone wanting 3D content without an official source.</p><p>If you want easy plug-and-play spatial tracking that works with any device, Xreal One or Xreal One Pro are the best picks. If you want broader ecosystem compatibility and more power-user settings for features like 3D video or multi-monitor support, Viture Pro or Ultra are great choices. I just wish Viture could support spatial tracking without requiring additional software.</p><h2 id="viture-luma-x-cyberpunk-2077-2">Viture Luma x Cyberpunk 2077</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eBCQ9QxTJf8E4ccZAYpBx4" name="viture-luma-cyberpunk-2077-official-render-02" alt="An official product render of Viture x Cyberpunk 2077 smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eBCQ9QxTJf8E4ccZAYpBx4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Viture)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Cyberpunk fans may be thrilled to know that Viture and CD Projekt Red have teamed up to make a limited edition Cyberpunk 2077-themed pair of Luma glasses.

The headset was pretty much tailor-made for newcomers to VR gaming, boasting the same graphical processing power as the standard Quest 3 at a significantly lower cost.</p><p>In fact, as described in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-review">our 4.5/5-star review</a>, the Quest 3S is "quite literally a Quest 3 with the Quest 2's lenses and display". Starting at $299, the beginner-friendly VR headset also boasts upgraded hand tracking and low light tracking capabilities, next-gen controllers, and complete access to the same library of games as the more-expensive Meta Quest 3. Furthermore, the device is powered by the cutting-edge Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 processor and comes with 8GB of RAM straight out of the box.</p><p>Sure, if you directly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-vs-quest-3">compare the Meta Quest 3S with the standard Quest 3</a>, you'll notice that the more affordable model has a lower-res display and narrower field-of-view than its premium counterpart, but you're also paying at least $200 less for it. In other words, if you're trying to get into VR gaming for the first time, the Meta Quest 3S is the best way to do it for cheap, <em>especially</em> when you slap on a $50 no-strings discount from Walmart.</p><h2 id="holiday-deals-2025-quick-links-2">Holiday deals 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 50% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>major discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Both of these specifications are shocking when you consider that the tablet barely weighs over a pound (469 grams). </p><p>The Galaxy Tab S11 also comes with an S Pen stylus, while the first-party keyboard case (included with your purchase from Samsung.com) is a quick and easy way to convert your tablet into a laptop whenever you want. </p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XdX3gXQJnkFxVyvvcPWmgX" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-FE-Tab-S11-1" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 in between two Samsung Galaxy S25 FE models." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XdX3gXQJnkFxVyvvcPWmgX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="should-i-buy-the-galaxy-tab-s11-from-samsung-or-amazon-2">Should I buy the Galaxy Tab S11 from Samsung or Amazon?</h2><p>While Amazon may be offering the Galaxy Tab S11 at the same price (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Android-Display-Performance-Note-Taking/dp/B0FGKN976K"><strong>$759.99 without trade-in</strong></a>), there are a few reasons you should consider buying the tablet directly from the source.</p><p>As I mentioned above, purchasing the device through <strong>Samsung.com</strong> will get you a free Book Cover Keyboard Slim case.

When a user makes an emergency call, the connected dispatcher now has the option of requesting a live video feed from your Android phone. This can help emergency dispatchers better assess your situation, send the right first responders, or guide you through live-saving steps, according to Google.</p><p>Emergency Live Video is enabled by default, and requires no manual setup. The tool is available any time an emergency call or text is initiated from an Android phone. Emergency Live Video is requested by the dispatcher when necessary, and when requested, Android users will see a <strong>Share live video?</strong> prompt on their device. They can choose <strong>No thanks</strong> or <strong>Share</strong> to start streaming video from their camera with a single tap.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QUjM7w3whU2sYtyxZx8hqW" name="Android-Emergency-Live-Video-3" alt="The steps for using Android Emergency Live Video." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QUjM7w3whU2sYtyxZx8hqW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Once shared, Emergency Live Video is a live feed with an interface that can be minimized while users take other important actions on their device. Emergency Live Video supports flipping the camera to show emergency dispatchers the best angle, and there's a large <strong>Stop sharing</strong> button that can end the live feed immediately.</p><p>Google says Emergency Live Video is built to be "simple and secure," and it's completely optional. "The feature is encrypted by default, and you are always in control of whether your video is shared, and can stop sharing instantly at any time," the company explains.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iAdW6LF5RyFbkxTDRHzrRi" name="Android-Emergency-Live-Video-2" alt="Android Emergency Live Video on a Pixel." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iAdW6LF5RyFbkxTDRHzrRi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Emergency Live Video is the Android equivalent of Apple's Emergency SOS live video, which was added to the iPhone 14 and later with iOS 18.

The feature will work on Android phones running Android 8 or higher with Google Play Services, meaning it's supported on most models still in use today.</p><p>Emergency Live Video expands the emergency video recording feature available on Google Pixel phones, and brings the versatile option to all Android phones.

So, if an important app sends a generic promo code, the system can mark it as junk but still let urgent messages through.</p><p>You get four primary categories where these low-priority pings are sequestered: Promotions and News are enabled by default, while Social and Suggested options require a manual toggle. Rather than filling up your main feed, these notifications are grouped in the Silent section of your shade, marked with an AI sparkle icon.</p><h2 id="flagship-exclusive-for-now-2">Flagship exclusive for now</h2><p>Although the feature is part of the December 2025 rollout, it is exclusive to the Pixel 9 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-series-your-ultimate-guide">Pixel 10</a> lineups, with the budget-friendly Pixel 9a excluded.</p><p>Before searching for the feature, check that you are in a supported region. The rollout is happening in the U.S., UK, Canada, Australia, Germany, and Japan, and it only works if your system language is set to English.</p><p>If you have a supported device, the option might not show up right away, even after updating your software. Restarting your phone can make the feature appear.</p><p>Once it is available, go to Settings, then Notifications, and then Notification Organizer to adjust your preferences. You can turn on extra categories or enable 'Always expand bundles' if you want to see more at a glance.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Samsung will also reportedly equip all accessories with magnets for wireless charging and for attaching mounts.</p><h2 id="a-closer-look-at-samsung-s-new-qi2-accessory-plans-2">A closer look at Samsung's new Qi2 accessory plans</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="y8h3vMdZKACqFBnA9YtG5H" name="samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-caseborne-case-01.jpg" alt="The Caseborne clear case with MagSafe magnets for the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y8h3vMdZKACqFBnA9YtG5H.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As with every Galaxy S launch, you can expect a wide range of accessories to debut alongside the S26 lineup. According to the leak, Samsung will introduce a premium-feeling Magnetic Carbon Case for the Galaxy S26 and Galaxy S26 Ultra.</p><p>In addition to the carbon case, you can also expect magnetic clear cases, magnetic rugged cases, and, for the first time, magnetic silicone cases for all Galaxy S26 phones. However, it appears that the Magnetic Carbon Case will be exclusive to the Galaxy S26 Ultra and Galaxy S26 Plus, and will not be available for the baseline <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-accidentally-leaks-s26-design-one-ui-8-5">Galaxy S26</a>.</p><p>There's also mention of a "dual magnet holder ring" for all models, though for now we don't know what it will be used for.</p><p>Quandt also mentions a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-qi2-charger-leak-suggests-a-magsafe-rival-could-finally-come-to-the-galaxy-s26">new Magnetic Wireless Battery Pack</a> with Qi2 support (model number EB-U2500) that will work similarly to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phone-users">MagSafe power banks</a> we've seen for iPhones. The external power bank will reportedly offer a 5000mAh capacity.</p><p>In addition to this, Quandt says the Galaxy S26 series will also come with a Bluetooth S Pen as an "optional accessory or spare part." Samsung removed Bluetooth support from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s26-ultra-s-pen-bluetooth-support">Galaxy S25 Ultra's S Pen</a>, but it appears it might be making a comeback, although it's possible the company may sell the Bluetooth version as an extra purchase.</p><p>The leak also mentions that Samsung will sell anti-reflective screen protectors for all Galaxy S26 models. While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-ultra-leak-reveals-a-slimmer-beast-with-blazing-fast-charging">Galaxy S26 Ultra</a> is expected to feature anti-reflective Gorilla Glass out of the box, it's good to see Samsung selling anti-reflective protectors for all models so users can get a similar feel across the lineup.</p><p>The Galaxy S26 series isn't far away now, with the leak mentioning that Samsung is reportedly planning to launch the phones near the end of February 2026, which is different from what we've previously heard. This could be due to the Galaxy S26 Plus <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s26-edge-might-not-be-dead">replacing the Galaxy S26 Edge</a> late in development. That said, we're only a couple of months away, so things should become clearer as we get closer to launch.</p> ]]></dc:content>

After sifting through a recent Play Services beta, AssembleDebug was able to (in a way) activate Google's version of Apple's contact sharing feature. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/Y2-LxVx62x0">tipster's video evidence</a> shows how this could work between devices, as they hold one phone atop the other.</p><p>There appears to be some distance between phones; however, an almost creamsicle-colored animation appears shortly after.</p><p>The lights appear along the top portion of both phones, rolling through their rounded corners and down the display partway. The animation will likely appear, alongside the contact information you've shared and received. The animation recedes to the punch hole selfie camera once the process is completed.</p><p>NFC still appears to play a major part in this contact exchange, but, as the tipster states, it's unclear just how reliant on it the feature will be. As development progresses, the tipster speculates that NFC could simply kickstart the feature before throwing things over to a user's Bluetooth or even Wi-Fi connectivity for the rest.</p><h2 id="one-tap-done-2">One tap, done</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1067px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="YQLqgV4NfDbEq5jfEF8vyG" name="android-apple-namedrop-like-feature-progress-leak" alt="Google's version of Apple's NameDrop leaked again, showcasing bright, cream-colored animation along the top portion of the phone during the sharing process." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YQLqgV4NfDbEq5jfEF8vyG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1067" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority / YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This is the second time Google's version of Apple's NameDrop has appeared in rumors.

The code called the feature a "Gesture Exchange," while other important code bits highlighted its reliance on NFC. It's been speculated that, much like Apple, Google's version would let users share their phone number, photo, name, and email.</p><p>That earlier discovery even leverage a small menu, which could greet users before sharing information.</p><p>Users may find a checklist of details they'd like to share before "tapping" their phone on somdone else's to begin the transfer.

The post alleges some details about the tracker's upgrades, stating the Moto Tag 2 could boast a stronger, longer-lasting battery than its first iteration. Moreover, the company could equip the next tracker with increased location precision, alongside "better button tactility."</p><p>Ultrawide band connectivity (UWB), IP67 dust and water protection are rumored for the next tracker. The publication reportedly obtained the alleged promotional material for the Moto Tag 2, showing off its updated design.</p><p>Per the image, the Moto Tag 2 is seemingly preparing to arrive in two colors: a peach option and an almost cream-colored version, too. Additionally, the rendering suggests the main body of the tracker could remain the same. The render shows a raised portion on the tracker's button (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/moto-tag-bluetooth-tracker-launch">like the first model</a>). The image then highlights a punch hole at the top.</p><p>What's unclear about this is whether it's a loophole for a string to slide through or, perhaps, a more pronounced tiny speaker.</p><h2 id="tagged-but-with-a-2-2">Tagged, but with a 2</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:471px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:127.39%;"><img id="KidnNEoifJMNKUmJHWDryH" name="motorola-moto-tag-2-alleged-render" alt="An alleged rendering of the Moto Tag 2 from Motorola, which retains a similar design to the first iteration with a raised portion for its physical button." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KidnNEoifJMNKUmJHWDryH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="471" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There was a lot of interest around Motorola's first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/moto-tag-bluetooth-tracker-launch">Bluetooth tracker when it launched</a> in the summer of 2024. The company sought to make a bold statement in a market <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-trackers">with multiple options</a>. The original launched with a small and sleek design, which we're expecting Motorola to continue with the second generation, if the rumors are to be believed. Motorola launched its Tag with full <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-find-hub-app-redesign-rolling-out">Find My Device network</a> compatibility, meaning Android users anywhere could utilize its capabilities.</p><p>The Tag's battery is estimated to last users a whole year before needing a replacement.

The phone's alleged renders make it look similar to its 2025 counterpart, though it might swap its glass back for an "eco-leather" material. The same mid-range RAM/storage options are suspected, but there could be more in store for its battery capacity. The publication claims that this Moto Tag 2 might even debut with the G Stylus in 2026.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Kicking off the phone's reveal is the "Made Together" campaign, which Nothing states, "celebrates the design process and collaboration within the Nothing community." The design language of this campaign represents "making tech fun to inspire human creativity." It credits campaign winner, Sushruta Sarkar, for taking charge here.</p><p>According to Nothing, the winning design for the Phone 3a goes to one of its campaign creators, Emre Kayganacl. This was "stage one" in the development process, as Kayganacl spearheaded the Phone 3a's new aesthetic with a "late 90s and early 2000s technology" theme. The Phone 3a's Community Edition takes on this light blue color, which Nothing says reminds it of old game toys (think Game Boy).</p><p>Joining the Phone 3a is an accessory: dice. Nothing states that while dice typically represent chance in gaming and more, it paired this Phone 3a'a accessory with dice that feature its Ndot 55 font. Ambrogio Tacconi and Louis Aymond took charge of this particular development aspect.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EMYoXTO4mHI" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>The final aspect of the Phone 3a, bringing it all home, is its lock screen and wallpaper design. Nothing states the device's new design, led by Jad Zock, "reduces visual clutter and guides the eye intuitively to the key components." The company also states that consumers interested in the phone will find that the design still ensures users get all the information they need quickly without forgetting.</p><p>Nothing credits Jad Zock's design as one that seamlessly merges the rear design with its digital aesthetic. Users will find four versions of this wallpaper available (two blue, two purple) as well as a few easter eggs.</p><h2 id="the-community-edition-is-here-2">The Community Edition is here</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="RohXyfpWxeynJHJY8NUUSQ" name="nothing-phone3a-community-edition-dice-accessory" alt="The Nothing's Phone 3a Community Edition is paired with an accessory: dice, which features the company's classic font for the numbers." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RohXyfpWxeynJHJY8NUUSQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nothing)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="MSmGo2mvDpmDfy2obmJnRQ" name="nothing-phone3a-community-edition-wallpaper" alt="Nothing's Phone 3a Community Edition wallpaper blends its rear design with its digital screen seamlessly for a retro aesthetic." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MSmGo2mvDpmDfy2obmJnRQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nothing)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>As stated previously, Nothing is only creating 1,000 Phone 3a Community Editions for consumers in a 12/256GB variant.

Android Central's Senior Editor, Nicholas Sutrich, got a package from Motorola earlier this week, and the box had an invite to its CES display, plus a wooden flip book that opens and folds into a lamp, with a dim red light.</p><p>According to Sutrich, the lamp features a magnetic clasp that keeps it fully open and folded backward. This package did give us a peek into what Motorola could have in store at CES, a possible new flagship device that could look a lot like a book-style foldable, much like the Galaxy Z Fold 7.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="au6raWoy5ELxshCh8gdan" name="Moto-fold-CES" alt="Motorola could be teasing its next Moto Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/au6raWoy5ELxshCh8gdan.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Now hear us out, there were several clues within the package that just screamed that this new form factor could be in the works. The most obvious indication is within the invite itself, which states, "We're getting ready to unfold a new perspective at Lenovo Tech World, set to take place on January 6." The emphasis on "unfold" caught our attention, given that Motorola's current foldable phones are all Flip devices.</p><p>The mysterious device also might feature a wooden finish, suggested by the wooden cover of the foldable lamp. It also has the Motorola "M" logo engraved on it, with the line "every fold reveals a possibility."</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="s3JF9Xj7weJ4WeAZDZDyo" name="Moto-fold-CES" alt="Motorola could be teasing its next Moto Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/s3JF9Xj7weJ4WeAZDZDyo.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="upYsuGLtYu6ib9apVtYqn" name="Moto-fold-CES" alt="Motorola could be teasing its next Moto Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/upYsuGLtYu6ib9apVtYqn.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HKfLwP689ohPYQrdz7QotY" name="motorola-ces-2026-fold-teaser-01" alt="Motorola sent us a teaser package that screams something exciting is brewing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HKfLwP689ohPYQrdz7QotY.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Considering, Motorola is the only company that likes to experiment with unique materials such as bamboo, teak, ebony, and walnut wood in its smartphone designs, since the <em>Moto X</em> days (starting around 2013-2014), where the company allowed users to fully customize their devices. And more recently, with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/what-motorola-razr-ultra-2025-color-should-you-buy">Motorola Razr 2025,  Mountain Trail edition</a>, which featured thin wood inlay.</p><p>The lamp's mechanism is such that it unfolds end-to-end, with its pages illuminated in a red hue; however, it remains unclear whether the foldable device will operate just like the lamp, which only time will tell. Until then, we're just letting our imaginations run wild about the kind of device Motorola is brewing for us(a Fold with a wooden back?), set to be unveiled on January 6, 2026.</p> ]]></dc:content>

From using ready-made templates, a redesigned video editor, to adding music and custom text, the tech giant is bringing five new features to make these reels more personal.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2298px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:58.40%;"><img id="u67pFnVwivG7sKDFZdgWvk" name="Google-Photos-video-update" alt="Google Photos' video editor gets a glow up" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/u67pFnVwivG7sKDFZdgWvk.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2298" height="1342" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2298px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:58.40%;"><img id="tKJmsHs9v6tfyLbhaf3j2m" name="Google-Photos-video-update" alt="Google Photos' video editor gets a glow up" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tKJmsHs9v6tfyLbhaf3j2m.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2298" height="1342" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Google Photos will show you different templates to pick from, giving you a creative push for your highlight reel if you don't know where to begin. The platform has significantly updated its editor to be more user-friendly and intuitive, giving it a major glow-up.  The enhanced editor supports multi-clip editing and storytelling, and also includes an "adaptive canvas" to simplify the editing process, like switching around clips within the video or adjusting the length of the video clip, all in one place.</p><p>Additionally, users will be able to edit and customize each video clip within the reel by adding music or custom text to it as well.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="LGrEzFj8o2WP8L6z8YYJMC" name="Google-Photos-video-update" alt="Google Photos brings nifty video editing tools" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LGrEzFj8o2WP8L6z8YYJMC.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Speaking of having it all in one place, users will also be able to add audio from the Photos’ music library and pick the perfect track that adds "emotion or brings out the right vibe to your highlight video on Android and iOS."</p><p>Google Photos is adding text editing features, basically ditching the need to switch to other applications like Instagram or TikTok. Users on Android can now utilize "stylish text overlays" for their highlight videos, with customizable options for fonts, colors, and backgrounds to make their message prominent.</p><p>Google says these editing tools will begin rolling out today (Dec.9), so you can give them a go within the Photos app.</p> ]]></dc:content>
