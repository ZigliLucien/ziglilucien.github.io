<hr>
<p>Starting your week is a host of supposed cases for Google's next budget phone for the Pixel 9 series.</p><p>Google is expected to have a "Pixel 9a" up its sleeve this year and a leak by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/exclusive-google-pixel-9a-official-cases-3524391/">Android Authority</a> might've spilled its alleged cases. The publication suggests the cases will arrive in four colors: Peony, Obsidian, Iris, and Porcelain. The cases are said to be "soft silicone" casing, but there's one thing that stands out: a lack of Google's camera visor.</p><p>The rear panel features a colored "G" for Google (depending on the color chosen) and a simple cutout for its camera lenses. Even from an angled view, the supposed Pixel 9a cases don't show any sort of accommodation for the thick visor that Google is known for.</p><p>Additionally, the left side of the renderings shows two bumps for the device's physical buttons. Those will likely be its power button and volume rocker. The opposite side seems relatively clean, void of any bumps.</p><p>The post alleges that Google will opt to deliver a "microfiber lining on the inside of the case," as well. Pricing for the four cases isn't yet known; however, there's speculation that they could sit at roughly $29.99 like the ones for the Pixel 8a.</p>

<p>Speaking of the Pixel 8a, those cases might not offer a raised rear portion, but the placement of the camera visor is completely open. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a> offers a horizontal camera visor that runs the span of its rear panel width-wise. So, it makes sense that Google would want to show that off, but things appear different for its next iteration.</p><p>All of this is speculation until we hear from Google, but the latest case leak seemingly doubles down on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/supposed-pixel-9a-render-camera-bump-change">that major Pixel 9a rumor</a> from September. A set of Pixel 9a renderings surfaced, showcasing a budget Pixel without Google's usual camera bump/visor. Instead, the images showed a phone with a dual camera array that's flush to its back panel. Nestled beside that array will supposedly be its LED flash.</p><p>Most other elements appear similar to what we're used to: a flat display, flat sides, and rounded corners.</p><p>A couple of months later came <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-leak-reveal-every-last-spec-of-the-handset">a massive specifications leak</a> that might've told us all we needed to know. The Pixel 9a is rumored to feature a 6.2-FHD Plus display, the Tensor G4 chip, and a 48MP primary camera.</p><p>While Google usually drops its budget Pixel A-series closer to the summer, things could <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-google-pixel-9as-exact-release-date-is-already-known-report-claims">kick off in March</a>, instead. Rumors claim the Pixel 9a could debut on March 26 with pre-orders beginning one week beforehand. The device is also suspected to feature two configurations for $399 and $499 (256GB), respectively.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung is pushing the February 2025 security patch to the Galaxy S24 in Korea.</li><li>The update should appear for devices in other regions and cellular carriers soon.</li><li>The patch is based on Android 14 and One UI 6.1, and it comes as Samsung faces more One UI 7 delays.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>One UI 7 finally debuted on the newest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Samsung Galaxy S25 series</a>, but owners of older Galaxy phones are still left waiting. It looks like that wait will continue a bit longer, because Samsung's February 2025 security patch is starting to roll out for Galaxy S24 devices in Korea — and it's built on One UI 6.1 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> instead of One UI 7 and Android 15 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/samsung-galaxy-s24-latest-update-leave-you-disappointed/">Android Police</a>).</p><p>The news of Samsung's monthly update rolling out based on an older version of One UI comes just after a report revealed<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-delayed-february-issues-reported"> the company needed one more One UI 7 beta update</a> before a public rollout. That's because it found a problem that "causes the display color temperature to appear more yellow than intended," per a Samsung community post.</p><p>The monthly update is appearing for users in South Korea with an update size of about 455MB, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/tarunvats33/status/1888783290485850290" target="_blank">Tarun Vats on X (formerly Twitter)</a>. It'll soon arrive for Samsung Galaxy S24 owners in other markets, but may take a while to show up depending on your combination of region and cellular carrier.</p>

<p>As the company details on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://security.samsungmobile.com/securityUpdate.smsb" target="_blank">security updates page</a>, the February 2025 update for the Galaxy S24 includes Google's patches in the Android Security Bulletin for this month. That includes one security vulnerability with a "critical" severity designation and 34 vulnerabilities with a "high" designation. Additionally, Samsung is patching seven issues that specifically affect Galaxy devices.</p><p>There are no new features in the February 2025 patch, and that's unsurprising. Samsung's upcoming One UI 7 upgrade is a massive one, with new features, a visual overhaul, and more. The existing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24 series</a> will feel fresh after that upgrade, but the wait for it has been a long one. Google delivered Android 15 to the Android Open Source Project a while ago, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a> still isn't here.</p><p>For now, Galaxy S24 users will have to settle for their February 2025 security patch. When the update becomes available for your device, you can install it by opening Settings and navigating to <strong>Software update > Download and install</strong>.</p>

<ul><li>The Oppo Find N5 will be launched on February 20 in Singapore.</li><li>The Find N5 is expected to be the slimmest foldable phone ever made, potentially rebranded as the OnePlus Open 2 in some regions.</li><li>The phone will be available in Cosmic Black and Misty White, featuring a slim design with a large camera visor.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>In less than ten days from now, we will likely witness the world’s slimmest foldable phone as Oppo just announced the launch date of its much-anticipated Find N5.</p><p>After several leaks and rumors, the company now has a launch event set for February 20, which is the global launch going to be held in Singapore. The teaser images from Oppo already reveal how slimmer the phone looks when folded and unfolded, and is certainly creating curiosity amongst tech enthusiasts, which very few <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> have been able to create in recent times.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bqcR0xMhZT0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Another reason for the raised anticipation is that the Find N5 is likely to be dubbed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-2">OnePlus Open 2</a> in other regions including the U.S. The company also boasts that the Find N5 is the most powerful and durable foldable phone that it has ever made, alongside its slimmer form factor.</p><p>While the Find N5 is already teased with images, Oppo has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/oppo/status/1888754764894073323">also confirmed</a> that it would be coming in two colorways: Cosmic Black and Misty White. Design-wise, the Find N5 should measure as thin as a USB Type-C port on one side, and the other side is likely to be even more slimmer.</p><p>The camera visor still looks gigantic, and Hasselblad’s integration also appears to be in place. A triple rear camera setup is expected, and the visor that size could make the device wobbly when placed on a table.</p>
<p>The teaser further hints at Gemini integration right out of the box on the Find N5. However, it is still unclear whether there would be freebies like a free Gemini One AI Premium subscription with the purchase of the Find N5 similar to the Pixel 9 series.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, some of the leaked hands-on images of the Find N5 reveal a promising foldable coming from Oppo. The device can be seen from all angles, and the notable foldable screen is also visible.</p>

<ul><li>The latest beta version of Google Messages showcases a new upcoming feature.</li><li>The messaging service will soon allow users to delete sent messages similar to WhatsApp.</li><li>These features would however work with the same app version or above as older versions wouldn't likely support the feature.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>RCS messaging has been a convenience for every Android phone ever since the Google Messages app started pushing it. The search giant has been constantly adding new features, and the new one in the works might allow users to rely less on third-party messaging services.</p><p>A recent APK Insight from folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/06/google-messages-rcs-delete/">9to5Google</a> has revealed that Google Messages, which incorporates <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-rcs-and-why-it-important-android">RCS (Rich Communication Services)</a>, will likely be adding a new functionality that lets users delete sent messages forever similar to what we are used to on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-messaging-apps">other messaging platforms</a> like WhatsApp, for example.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2WdULw6noDbNsWHtYwxQ5T" name="Google-Messages-iOS.jpeg" alt="Google Messages on an Android phone atop an iPhone." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2WdULw6noDbNsWHtYwxQ5T.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>According to the publication, the Google Messages app in beta bearing <strong>20250131_02_RC00</strong> version has showcased several strings, representing multiple upcoming features that app users are likely to see. Like WhatsApp, users will be able to delete the messages they send, which further gives options like “Delete for me” and “Delete for everyone.”</p><p>These actions will reciprocate with additional relevant notes like “You deleted a message”, “Message deleted by its author” and “sender attempted to delete a message.” As mentioned, these features are quite familiar on other messaging services and it is encouraging to see RCS likely to implement them soon.</p>
<p>Users will have to remember that even though these features should be rolling out to the latest version of the RCS, users who are on the same version of the messaging service would be able to take full advantage of these features. For instance, if you are on the latest RCS version that supports the deleting sent messages feature, the recipient on the receiving end would still be able to see the message if the user is on the older version of the RCS service on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>.</p><p>It is still unclear whether this will be applicable for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/apple-ios-18-adds-rcs-support-android">iOS version of RCS</a>, and it will only be determined when the feature rolls officially to Android devices followed by iOS devices — likely in the near future.</p>

<p>Many Garmin users spend years between upgrades. Since I've reviewed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-2-solar-review">Instinct 2 Solar</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-2x-solar-review">Instinct 2X Solar</a>, and a dozen other Garmins, it's easier to take the flashlight, dual-band GPS, and other cool upgrades for granted, where last-gen users will be excited by the innovation.</p><p>When Garmin offered me the Instinct 3 AMOLED or Solar to review, I chose the AMOLED at once. Aside from my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitness-watches-mip-to-amoled-transition-long-overdue">deep dislike of MIP displays</a>, I couldn't believe that Garmin still gave a $450 watch the same 1.1-inch, 176 x 176 resolution display just to prioritize "unlimited battery life" and an epic 260 GPS hours over everyday usability. Not to mention the return of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gadgetsandwearables.com/2025/01/31/garmin-instinct-3-solar-mini-display-off-centre/">frequently misaligned</a> second window.</p><p>The full-res, 1.3-inch AMOLED display looks lovely on my Neo Tropic Instinct 3, decently bright in direct sunlight and accentuated by the glossy orange aluminum bezel that catches light along its edge. You dip from over a month or two of solar battery life to 18–24 days. But at least your notifications and data graphs are more <em>readable</em>, and it remains longer-lived than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review">Venu 3</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-265-review">Forerunner 265</a>.</p><p>Still, I think the Garmin Instinct 3 AMOLED needed a trademark feature, similar to the Solar version's "unlimited" battery shtick. Garmin probably thought the flashlight and ruggedness qualified. But I think finally putting offline maps or LTE on a mid-range Garmin watch would've been the real game-changer.</p><p>Instead, Garmin made compromises with the Instinct 3 software and features that feel designed to upsell you to the $900 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-launches-new-fenix-8-and-enduro-3">Enduro 3</a> to get the real 2025 Garmin adventurer experience.</p>

<p>Garmin may have kicked off the MIP-to-AMOLED transition among running watch brands, but its rivals quickly followed suit. And when you look at the $399 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-pace-pro-review">COROS PACE Pro</a>, $399 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/polar-vantage-m3-gps-hr-accuracy-test">Polar Vantage M3</a>, or $449 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/suunto-race-review">Suunto Race</a>, you'll find they all added offline maps to go with their new AMOLED displays.</p><p>Most running watches let you download a GPX route from Strava or create one from your watch's companion app, then follow turn-by-turn directions with a line showing a breadcrumb trail of GPS data points you've hit in case you need to retrace your steps. That line appeared on a blank screen, with no visual context for trails, streets, or hills.</p><p>Then, the higher-end watches started adding downloadable offline maps that contextualized your route. You could see how the GPX route and GPS breadcrumbs aligned with real-world geography, making it easier to know where you're going or if you've strayed from the proper path.</p><p>Garmin restricts this feature to its Fenix, Enduro, and other $1,000-range series, except for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Forerunner 965</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-955-review">Forerunner 955</a>. Maps were Garmin's bargaining chip to upsell runners from the Forerunner 255/265, and they weren't necessarily a priority for the indoor-focused Venu 3 or the no-altimeter Vivoactive 5.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LeGRhUG7om4UKsZqowAJ7N" name="Garmin-Instinct-3-AMOLED-press-photo" alt="A photo of the Garmin Instinct 3 AMOLED on a man's wrist as he fishes" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LeGRhUG7om4UKsZqowAJ7N.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Still, the Instinct series is <em>designed</em> for people spending weeks out in nature, who might need an offline map backup in case their phone dies and they haven't pre-downloaded a route. But this would've required giving the Instinct 3 a more robust processor, an actual touchscreen, and (for the Solar series) ditching the low-res, two-window solution.</p><p>Instead, Garmin cut corners and costs: the Instinct 3 has noticeable lag and button-only input to navigate through menus. You'll have to buy the Enduro 3 for solar charging and maps.</p><p>When you consider that the freaking $99 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-active-2-announced-ces-2025">Amazfit Active 2</a> has offline maps, it makes Garmin start to look out of touch in this area, even if it's well ahead of its rivals in other ways. Brands like Apple and Samsung may price-lock the best sensors and tools out of their cheaper SE or FE watches... but those watches cost half as much as the Instinct 3.</p>
<h2 id="coasting-on-last-gen-sensors-2">Coasting on last-gen sensors</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="8hAZJpKwgtKJBP2hWZ2AJX" name="IMG_9792" alt="The bottom sensor array of the Garmin Instinct 3, with etched data like 10ATM water resistance and MIL-STD-810 protection around the array." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8hAZJpKwgtKJBP2hWZ2AJX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Instinct 3 has the same heart rate sensor as the Instinct 2 when it launched three years ago. Does that matter?</p><p>You could argue that most healthy Garmin users don't need the Elevate v5's ECG tool, but outdoor sports like hiking are very popular with the middle-aged to elderly crowd that might want to occasionally check on their heart health. And skin temperature is becoming increasingly common as a metric to judge everything from possible sickness to period symptoms.</p><p>At the very least, you can rest assured that the Garmin Instinct 3 heart rate data is as accurate as most other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watches</a>. I gave it my traditional anaerobic track workout test, which most wrist-based optical sensors struggle with. Despite the rapid HR changes and cold (for California) weather, it stayed relatively close to my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-heart-rate-monitor-review">COROS HRM</a> data, only falling 1 bpm short on average.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2017px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:44.03%;"><img id="UgDatcuRE9qcfdX5yipEqg" name="Garmin-Instinct-3-heart-rate-track-test" alt="Heart rate chart showing how the Garmin Instinct 3 heart rate during a track workout compares to the COROS heart rate monitor." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UgDatcuRE9qcfdX5yipEqg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2017" height="888" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For a more "normal" run, it's also about what you'd expect: The Garmin Instinct 3 is very close to the armband data at all times with a minimal 1 bpm gap at almost every point and the same HR average at the end.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2017px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:44.52%;"><img id="5VW7jUiKT9sYbfwBw5GBGZ" name="Garmin-Instinct-3-heart-rate-run-test" alt="A heart rate chart showing how the Garmin Instinct 3 compares to a COROS HRM for HR accuracy during a low-aerobic run." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5VW7jUiKT9sYbfwBw5GBGZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2017" height="898" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, you could certainly wish that there <em>wasn't</em> such a frequent gap, small as it is! But to be fair, the Elevate v5 sensor on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Fenix 8</a> isn't perfect either, though it does tend to course-correct to match my arm or chest monitor data a little faster.</p><p>The fact remains that Garmin shouldn't have coasted with last-gen sensors while charging current-gen prices. If the $299 Garmin Instinct E had used last-gen sensors, <em>that</em> would've been a reasonable compromise.</p><p>As for GPS data, I'll save the satellite maps and lines for my review. But you can rest assured that its multi-band GPS data <em>is</em> as accurate as what you get with the most expensive Garmin models — and most people will be perfectly satisfied with SatIQ or GPS mode accuracy.</p><p>This is why I'm trying to be cognizant that I take certain things for granted. Anyone coming from an older Garmin watch or switching from another brand will be thrilled by the accuracy. It's only power users and tech reviewers who might ask, "But what have you done for me lately?"</p>
<h2 id="the-garmin-instinct-3-is-missing-something-2">The Garmin Instinct 3 is missing something</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="xUMoARmbduWcr96hWf9MzW" name="IMG_9785" alt="Exercise load bar graph on the Garmin Instinct 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xUMoARmbduWcr96hWf9MzW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I don't want to downplay the Instinct 3's new features. I <em>love</em> training load focus for planning my next workout; nap detection and sleep coaching are useful for daily insights; running and cycling dynamics provide some niche info, and the AMOLED display is such a relief to my eyes.</p><p>But these are 2023 Forerunner and 2024 Venu perks essentially ported over. What is the Instinct series' specialization?</p><p>If this is for hikers or winter sports enthusiasts who need a rugged, long-lasting watch, I think they'd be more interested in built-in cellular support for emergencies, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/rucking-workout-fad-is-fun-novelty-but-not-for-everyone">rucking mode</a>, or an estimated hydration and electrolyte loss widget during activities. Yes, I wanted offline maps, but it'd be easier to swallow their absence if the Instinct 3 had dazzled us with other new tricks.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.wareable.com/garmin/garmin-posts-big-revenue-numbers">Fenix 8's massive success</a> proves Garmin users will pay a small fortune for the best features. But this means Garmin has less pressure to keep its mid-range models as competitive. Want better features <em>and</em> good battery life? Pay double for the Enduro 3 or Fenix 8!</p><p>I wish Garmin didn't restrict software so rigidly by price, but that's just how they do business. And its customers — who might grumble about missing features and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-watches-are-reportedly-crashing-displaying-a-blue-triangle">massive software crashes</a> — won't abandon Garmin over a disappointing launch. They'll just wait for the inevitable Garmin Instinct 3X.</p><p>In my case, just like I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-has-underwhelmed-me-despite-how-great-it-is">felt underwhelmed by the Fenix 8</a> even as I acknowledged how great it was, I'm side-eyeing the Instinct 3's stagnation while recognizing that, in a vacuum, this is a great <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watch</a> for anyone who uses their phone for maps and prioritizes battery life, durability, and "normal" Garmin smarts over any flashy new tricks.</p>

<p>OnePlus has officially opened its Health Laboratory in Guangdong, China, designed to crunch data and keep things user-centric to help people feel their best.</p><p>The facility is set to supercharge health tech in OnePlus devices. The lab is packed with top-notch gear for R&D, covering everything from simulating workout conditions and tracking energy burn to motion capture and health-focused optics. Basically, it’s a playground for pushing the limits of wellness tech.</p><p>The Health Lab’s grand opening comes just before OnePlus unveils its next-gen smartwatch.</p><p>With its new 4,840 square meter Health Lab, OnePlus is doubling down on its push for smarter health and wellness tech. This space is designed to fuel innovation for the OnePlus Health app and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">Watch 2</a> and 2R lineups.</p><p>OnePlus’s Health Lab has a killer setup for testing aerobic workouts. This R&D zone can mimic all sorts of activities—running, cycling, rowing, skiing, you name it. It’s stacked with 20 high-end simulators, like cycling rigs, massive treadmills, rowers, and climbing machines, giving researchers top-tier tools to work with.</p><p>Plus, there’s a 1,000-square-meter ball sports lab decked out with 24 infrared cameras for motion tracking, breaking down every move with precision.</p><p>The Health Lab is also built for research, packed with top-notch, industry-standard gear and tons of test scenarios. Take the energy metabolism module, for example: it uses a pulmonary function system to track stuff like oxygen use, calorie burn, and fat-burning efficiency. This helps fine-tune algorithms for wearables by studying how different people’s metabolisms react in different situations.</p><p>To really nail sports and health features, the lab also mimics real-world running and walking patterns across a bunch of simulated environments.</p><p>OnePlus broke ground on its Health Lab back in early 2023, pouring €13.5 million into building this high-tech hub.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-27">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Magnetic accessories can mess with the Galaxy S25 Ultra's S Pen’s performance, just like on the S24 Ultra.</li><li>Thicker cases might reduce interference, as shown when a MagSafe adapter didn’t trigger a warning.</li><li>So far, this seems like an isolated issue, but we’re waiting for Samsung’s response.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> stands out from the regular models thanks to its built-in S Pen. However, this version of the stylus takes a step backward. Samsung decided to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-ultras-s-pen-lacking-features-rumor">drop Bluetooth connectivity and Air Command support</a>, which means some of the cool features you might be used to are now missing. On top of that, we've learned that if you’re using magnetic accessories, they can mess with the S Pen’s performance.</p><p>Android Central's Andrew Myrick shared an interesting tidbit about his experience with the Galaxy S25 Ultra. While using a Fiberborne case, he got a heads-up from the phone itself—a pop-up message that states: "Magnetic accessories can interfere with your S Pen: The magnets in accessories can interfere with the signals your S Pen sends to your phone. They may cause your S Pen to not write correctly or cause Air commands to occur unintentionally."</p>

<p>This isn’t exactly a new problem, though. In fact, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-ultra-s-pen-magsafe-qi2-malfunction">Galaxy S24 Ultra has been dealing with the same S Pen interference issue</a> for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS24Ultra/comments/1bu4x5n/apparently_magnetic_cases_also_adversely_affect/" target="_blank">over 10 months now</a>. Since it first popped up, there have been plenty of reports from users noticing how magnetic accessories can throw off the stylus' signal.</p><p>Interestingly, the S24 Ultra’s S Pen comes with Bluetooth and Air Command support—features that didn’t make the cut for the S25 Ultra.</p><p>Despite that difference, both phones show the exact same warning about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-cases">magnetic accessories</a> interfering with the S Pen. This makes you wonder: did Samsung just forget to tweak the warning message for the S25 Ultra, or was dropping Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) from the S Pen a last-minute change? Either way, it’s a bit of a head-scratcher.</p><p>Furthermore, Myrick noticed that when he slapped a MagSafe adapter onto Samsung’s silicone case, the warning message about S Pen interference never appeared. This hints that the thickness of the case—and how far the magnets are from the S Pen—plays a big role in whether interference happens.</p><p>We’ve reached out to Samsung to get their take on this and will keep you posted as soon as they get back to us.</p><p>So far, we haven’t been able to find any other S25 Ultra devices where this same issue has popped up. It seems like this might be a one-off situation, at least for now.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Google quietly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/02/04/google-ai-policies-weapons-harm/" target="_blank">became more evil</a> this past week.</p><p>The company has changed its promise of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-sundar-pichai-importance-ai-ethics">AI responsibility</a> and no longer promises not to develop AI for use in dangerous tech. Prior versions of Google's AI Principles promised the company wouldn't develop AI for "<em>weapons or other technologies whose principal purpose or implementation is to cause or directly facilitate injury to people</em>" or "<em>technologies that gather or use information for surveillance violating internationally accepted norms</em>." Those promises <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ai.google/responsibility/principles/">are now gone</a>.</p><p>If you're not great at deciphering technobabble public relations pseudo-languages, that means making AI for weapons and spy "stuff." It suggests that Google is willing to develop or aid in the development of software that could be used for war. Instead of Gemini just drawing pictures of AI-powered death robots, it could essentially be used to help build them.</p>
<p>This is a slow but steady change from just a few years ago. In 2018, the company declined to renew the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-02-29/inside-project-maven-the-us-military-s-ai-project" target="_blank">Project Maven</a>" contract with the government, which analyzed drone surveillance, and failed to bid on a cloud contract for the Pentagon because it wasn't sure these could align with the company's AI principles and ethics.</p><p>Then in 2022, it was discovered that Google's participation in "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-project-nimbus-ai-surveillance-evil">Project Nimbus</a>" gave some executives at the company concerns that “Google Cloud services <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/03/technology/google-israel-contract-project-nimbus.html" target="_blank">could be used for, or linked to, the facilitation of human rights violations.</a>” Google's response was to force employees to stop discussing political conflicts like the one in Palestine.</p><p>That didn't go well, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-lays-off-more-employees-fires-protestors">leading to protests, mass layoffs,</a> and further policy changes. In 2025, Google isn't shying away from the warfare potential of its cloud AI.</p>

<p>This isn't too surprising. There's plenty of money to be made working for the Department of Defense or the Pentagon, and executives and shareholders really like plenty of money. However, there's also the more sinister thought that we're in an AI arms race and have to win it.</p><p>Demis Hassabis, CEO of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-deepmind-details-youtube-shorts-flamingo-ai">Google DeepMind</a>, says in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/responsible-ai-2024-report-ongoing-work/">blog post</a> that "democracies should lead in AI development." That's not a dangerous idea — until you read it alongside <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-03/palantir-gives-strong-2025-outlook-fueled-by-untamed-ai-demand?sref=HrWXCALa">comments</a> like Palantir CTO Shyam Sankar's, who says that an AI arms race must be a "whole-of-nation effort that extends well beyond the DoD in order for us as a nation to win."</p><p>These ideas can bring us to the brink of World War III. A winner-take-all AI arms race between the U.S. and China seems only good for the well-protected leaders of the winning side.</p>
<p>We all knew that AI would eventually be used this way. While joking about the Rise of the Machines, we were half-serious, knowing that there is a real possibility that AI could turn into some kind of super soldier that never needs to sleep or eat, only stopping to change its battery and fill its ammunition reserves. What is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/call-duty-mobile-hands-on">video game idea</a> today can become a reality in the future.</p><p>And there isn't a damn thing we can do about it. We could stop using all of Google's (and Nvidia's, Tesla's, Amazon's, and Microsoft's ... <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/judge-temporarily-halts-microsofts-jedi-pentagon-contract-amazons-request">you get the idea</a>) products and services as a way to protest and force a change. That might have an impact, but it's not a solution. If Google stops doing it, another company will take its place and hire the same people because they can offer more money. Or Google could simply stop making consumer products and have more time to work on very lucrative DoD contracts.</p>
<p>Technology should make the world a better place — that's what we are promised. Nobody ever talks about the evils and carnage it also enables. Let's hope someone in charge likes the betterment of mankind more than the money.</p>

This brought the company's total revenue for the year to $350 billion, a 14% increase year-over-year.</p><p>Google Service's revenues increased by 10% to $84.1 billion in the quarter, which the company attributed to the "strong momentum across Google Search & other and YouTube ads."</p><p>Looking ahead into the year, the company’s CEO, Sundar Pichai, said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://abc.xyz/assets/a3/91/6d1950c148fa84c7d699abe05284/2024q4-alphabet-earnings-release.pdf" target="_blank">in the earnings statement</a> that the quarter was strong "driven by our leadership in AI and the momentum across the business."</p><p>"We are building, testing, and launching products and models faster than ever, and making significant progress in computing and driving efficiency," Pichai said.</p><p>This year's statement was very AI-focused, underscoring the launch of DeepSeek, which has turned the tables for many such companies developing AI.</p><p>"The reason we are so excited about the AI opportunity is we know we can drive extraordinary use cases because the cost of actually using it is going to keep coming down, which will make more use cases feasible. And that's the opportunity space, you know, it's as big as it comes. And that's why you're seeing us invest to meet that moment," Pichai noted during the earnings call.</p>

That comes packed with "prioritized simplicity, elegance, and beauty," according to the company.</p><p>On the display front, it consists of a  6.78-inch FHD Plus screen with a 120Hz refresh rate, and users can bump this up to 144Hz while gaming for titles like Honkai: Star Rail or Zenless Zone Zero.</p><p>When it comes to the phone's cameras, it has a 50MP Sony Lytia 500  primary lens with 2x lossless zoom, a 13MP ultrawide lens, and a 32MP telephoto sensor with "built-in" OIS (optical image stabilization).

This would let users place the phone in landscape or portrait mode and press the side-mounted button instead of tapping the display.</p><p>If this were true, Nothing's Phone 3a would likely be the first ever Android phone to feature a camera button that could potentially allow users to control and swap between camera modes by slowly swiping along the button or pressing to snap a photo.</p>

The Chinese OEM said, "Be part of the extraordinary as we unveil the ultimate." The final part, "the ultimate," seemingly refers to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-ultimate-design-launch">the Mate XT</a>, also known as the Mate XT Ultimate Design.</p><p>Additionally, the post features a teaser image that looks like the Z-Shape.

The interesting thing about this phone is that users can use it in different "modes" or "states." Using a singular screen will give you a phone-style 6.4-inch OLED display while unfolding an additional screen provides a 7.9-inch experience.</p><p>At its maximum, the Mate XT is said to utilize the company's "golden ratio" of 16:11 in 3K resolution.</p>

In a leaked internal memo, Bosworth hinted at the Reality Labs’ work in mixed reality will either be game-changing or a potential "legendary misadventure."</p><p>Bosworth adds that Meta is sticking with the metaverse, including Horizon Worlds, through 2025, although the company will have to "need to drive sales, retention, and engagement across the board but especially in MR." Reality Labs, Meta's VR division, has taken several billions in funding, but it hasn't yet lived up to its word of making it big in the VR world. Reality Labs also added nearly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-q4-2024-earnings">$5 billion in losses</a> last quarter,</p><p>In other news, Meta's VP of VR and mixed reality (MR) has quit the company. Mark Rabkin has had the title of VP of VR/MR since the Oculus Quest 2 launched in 2020.</p><p>In a letter <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.facebook.com/mrabkin/posts/pfbid02UZ2ivLB5d1fXnGhckaTyy3jzYB5AsR9m65QNEFfeeDkGPaLDFbGoQgPVhMH771Vzl" target="_blank">shared on Facebook</a>, Rabkin describes his time at Meta as a "foundational, formative experience." Rabkin said he's leaving due to family health struggles at home, noting that he'll be taking some time off work rather before moving to a different position inside the company.</p><p>Rabkin has worked on many major projects from the ground up, like the Meta Quest headsets, over the past six years, including the transition from Oculus to Meta branding, creating record revenues of over 1 billion dollars last quarter alone. And played a major role in the Meta Quest 3S launch. According to Rabkin, Ryan Cairns, who formerly led Portal and Meta for Work initiatives, will now be filling his shows. Cairns is expected to assume the full title of VP of VR/MR at the beginning of March and will report to Vishal Shah, who will remain VP of Metaverse.</p>

The company saw substantial success in 2024, growing its market share by 20%, while Samsung and Apple both lost market share, and that's mainly due to the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-and-oneplus-could-learn-from-each-other-in-2025">having a Razr-sharp focus</a> on what it does best.</p><p>Enter the Moto G 2025, the unassuming $200 phone that's surprisingly competent. Last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-5g-2024-review">Moto G 5G 2024</a> was a pretty terrible phone, even for the low price, but Motorola has turned things around and addressed nearly every complaint I had without raising the price for this year's model. It's a success story few could hope for in an era of high inflation and tariff wars.</p>

<p>The Moto G 2025 is available universally unlocked at Amazon, Best Buy, and Motorola.com as of January 30, 2025. The phone retails for $199.99 and comes with 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage.</p><p>A swath of U.S. carriers will also offer the phone in the coming months, including T-Mobile, Metro by T-Mobile, AT&T, Cricket, Straight Talk, Total Wireless, Walmart for Verizon, Boost Mobile, XFinity Mobile, Consumer Cellular, Google Fi Wireless, Spectrum, UScellular, and Optimum Mobile.</p><p>Motorola will release the Moto G 2025 in Canada on May 2 at Motorola.ca and select carriers.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="jqsEAK95C6CqCf365eAxFL" name="moto-g-2025-back-01" alt="The lovely vegan leather back texture on the Moto G 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jqsEAK95C6CqCf365eAxFL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unlike last year's phone, the Moto G 2025 surprised me at nearly every turn. I love holding this phone because of the vegan leather back, and the design feels lighter than it actually is. It's also a tad larger than last year's Moto G 5G model, which might irritate a few people.</p><p>The 120Hz LCD screen has been notably improved over last year's model and now features an excellent sunlight mode that automatically kicks in whenever it detects extra-bright light. This makes it incredibly easy to see outside, which was a glaring weak point last year.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="quKvjhjNJ3dRyeK8en5zme" name="moto-g-2025-sunlight-mode" alt="The automatic sunlight mode makes the Moto G 2025's screen easily visible in direct sunlight" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/quKvjhjNJ3dRyeK8en5zme.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The LCD screen is also super eye-friendly. It uses full DC dimming with no PWM at any brightness level, no dithering, and no other nonsense. Not everyone loves the way an LCD screen looks when compared to an OLED but there's no denying they're friendlier on the eyes, especially for anyone sensitive to flicker.</p>

<p>Performance, especially in games, is surprisingly excellent. I played Minecraft with my son several times using this phone and was impressed with how much better it ran the game than the Nintendo Switch could. Other titles like Asphalt Legends Unite run super well, too, making this a surprisingly good mobile gaming machine.</p><p>Battery life is truly excellent and will always bring you through a full 24 hours of use. Many users will find that two or three-day battery life is achievable, and fully charging will take just over an hour with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-phone-charger">one of our favorite chargers</a>.</p><p>The Moto G 2025 offers microSD card support for expandable storage as well as a 3.5mm jack for wired headphone usage. The IP52 support is better than last year's offering, but the real improvement is the Gorilla Glass 3 on the front, which should help protect it long-term much better than the previous glass Motorola used.</p>

<p>As with any Motorola phone, you'll quickly fall in love with the Moto G 2025's quick gestures and actions. Double-chop the phone to toggle the flashlight, double-twist it to launch the camera, double-tap on the back to launch a custom app, and more. These are small things but they add up to big convenience and quickly turn into muscle memory.</p><p>The rest of Motorola's Hello UI (on top of Android 15) is also very fantastic, incorporating some of the best parts of AOSP and other skins under one roof. In many situations, Motorola gives you a choice to customize between various UI paradigms, including splitting the notification shade and quick toggles, lots of home screen customization options, and a surprising amount of lock screen customization, too.</p><p>Motorola is also offering 2 OS updates and 3 years of bimonthly security updates for the Moto G 2025, making it one of the best-supported budget phones available.</p>

<p>The camera has significantly improved quality over last year's Moto G 5G 2024, delivering the best camera experience I've seen on any budget-friendly Motorola phone.</p><p>Everything from dynamic range, fine details, noise in low light, and white balance have been substantially improved over last year's phone. Again, this is all without a price increase and along with other hardware improvements. Motorola really did a bang-up job here.</p>

<p>Aside from general quality improvements, Motorola has also notably improved the capture speed from the Moto G 2025's camera compared to previous Motorola phones in this line. Most photos are taken instantly with little to no delay, whereas last year's model sometimes took a full second or two after pressing the shutter button before you'd even hear the capture noise.</p><p>Likewise, low-light shots are taken much faster this time around, usually taking a second or two to capture a long-exposure shot, while the Moto G 5G 2024 might take five whole seconds to capture the same scene. Motorola's camera software can now be considered truly great and does an excellent job of using AI to understand the scene and automatically select the best picture after a capture.</p>

<p>The first time you do just about anything on the phone feels sluggish. Whether it's launching an app, starting the camera, or even just pulling down the notification shade, there's a level of lag that happens the first time around. This gives the initial impression of an extremely sluggish phone but, thankfully, it's not an impression that lasts over time.</p><p>Last year, the Moto G 5G 2024 was sluggish <em>all</em> the time, a problem that was further aggravated by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ram-boost-explained">RAM Boost feature</a> Motorola created to help devices with low quantities of RAM. This year, I can happily report that RAM Booster works much better, likely in part due to the switch from Qualcomm to MediaTek. Qualcomm makes great high-end chips but struggles to make a decent low-end one while MediaTek has been the star of this category for years.</p><p>Now, don't get me wrong. You're going to need to have a little more patience with a $200 phone than you will with something twice its price. Apps will take a little longer to open than those phones, but they're usually fine once they're up and running.</p>

<p>Motorola's refreshed Hello UX continues to be an excellent experience, but I still hate the multitasking UI. It still uses the very inefficient AOSP-style design found on Pixel phones and is simply one of the worst ways to quickly switch between apps you'll find anywhere. I'm hoping Motorola will tweak this in the future and offer customers the option for something better. The company offers several different UI tweaks, including a denser Quick Toggles UI if you want it, and you really should tweak this ancient design next.</p><p>Aside from this, it's difficult to nitpick any other negatives. IP52 is only splash-resistant, so you shouldn't bring your Moto G in the pool. The phone charges fairly quickly with a 30W charger, and while you'll need to buy one separately, it's a small price to pay for keeping the phone's price low.</p><p>Lastly, I'd love to see Motorola ditch the macro camera in favor of an ultrawide camera. I'm not sure how many people use macro mode on a regular basis, but I'd wager an ultrawide camera would be more popular.</p>

<p>As inflation continues to rise, the number of $200 phones has dwindled down to just a handful. We've already awarded the Moto G 2025 the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones-under-200">best phone under $200</a>, so anything else here is going to be worse for one reason or another.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/cmf-phone-1-review">CMF Phone 1</a> remains my favorite phone in the under $300 price class but that means you have to pay $80 or more to get this upgrade. It's got a better display, faster processor, better cameras, and a unique, customizable build that you're sure to love, but it only works on T-Mobile in the United States. Internationally, it's a much better buy and my go-to recommendation for budget-tier phones.</p><p>The Moto G Power 2025 offers better water and dust resistance, double the RAM, and a slightly bigger screen. These aren't minor upgrades, especially the IP68/IP69 rating which makes it one of the few elite phones to hold such a potent ingress protection rating. It's $299, though, so 50% more than the Moto G 2025.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy A15 5G stays in the $200 range and offers a vibrant AMOLED screen, but it's not suitable for folks sensitive to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a>. It's also got a lower refresh rate than the Moto G 2025's screen, has a slower processor, and the cameras aren't as good as Motorola's, but Samsung will update this phone until Android 18 is available, plus extra security updates on top of that.</p>

<p>Motorola has successfully turned things around and made the best $200 phone you can buy today. Its price flies in the face of inflation and delivers upgrades over last year's pretty awful model, all while keeping the price the same. Everything from the cameras to overall device performance, display quality and brightness, and even a longer software update promise to make this the phone to get at this price range.</p>

Now, anyone interested in buying a Qi2 charger for their Galaxy S25 will have to contend with buying a case for the phone, a concession some may not like. I used to be on their side, thinking how lame it is that Samsung is essentially forcing us to buy a case. However, I’ve started changing my tune after using the Galaxy S25 Plus with a case, even as the Motorola Razr teases a world where I don’t need one.</p>
<h2 id="learning-the-hard-way-to-embrace-the-case-2">Learning the hard way to embrace the case</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RwXShHPRxQXqZ4ffpRBctn" name="LG-G8-cracked-rear-glass-panel" alt="A cracked LG G8" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RwXShHPRxQXqZ4ffpRBctn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I’ve used the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-review">Galaxy S25 Plus</a> for a couple of weeks now, and I made sure that the first case I got was a magnetic case. In fact, I got a couple of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.esrgear.com/categories/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-phone-cases/">very stylish cases from ESR</a>, both of which are clear and nicely show off the Navy color of the Galaxy S25 Plus. The cases are thin and sport magnetic rings in a similar design found on iPhone cases: a circle with a line underneath.</p><p>This style of case is familiar because it's very common on iPhones. In fact, most iPhones I see out and about are fitted with a case of this sort despite the phones sporting built-in MagSafe support. The case requirement for Qi2 charging on the Galaxy S25 series only <em>feels</em> like a copout and money grab from Samsung in hopes that you'll buy one of its cases, but the way I see it, that's not the full story.</p>

<p>In fact, you should already <em>want</em> to buy a case for your $800+ phone, something I learned the hard way after buying an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/lg-g8-review">LG G8</a> at launch and dropping it just days later. I did not have a case, and the front and back glass cracked in one corner of the phone. Ever since then, I've used a case on nearly every phone I've owned, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus</a> being my only exception (more on that later).</p><p>With the Galaxy S25 Plus, I would like to go on using it without a case, but the phone is already fairly slippery, and I don't trust myself to keep this $1,000 phone intact. Plus, it turns out my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-review">Oura Ring</a> is scratching the rear glass panel whenever I hold the phone, which is ruining the pretty Navy color.</p><p>No one wants a bulky phone, but no one wants a broken one, either. If you really want Qi2 charging that bad, then you'll have to cough up the extra dough for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-cases">Galaxy S25 case</a>. I think that's a pretty small concession, considering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-was-smart-not-to-raise-the-price-of-the-galaxy-s25-ultra">Samsung didn't raise the price of the Galaxy S25 series</a>, plus you're getting protection and magnetic charging.</p>

<p>As cool as it would be to have built-in magnetic charging without a case, I can understand why Samsung didn't add it to the Galaxy S25 series. The phones haven't changed all that much in terms of design, so it’s not much of a surprise that the internal hardware didn't change much either, to the chagrin of myself and my colleagues.</p><p>As <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ask-jerry-qi2-and-the-galaxy-s25">explained</a> by my colleague Jerry Hildenbrand, it's likely going to require plenty of design tweaks to get magnetic charging in a phone. Given how many phones Samsung produces a year, the company likely just did not have the resources or time to get it how it needs to be, especially on the S Pen-touting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>.</p><p>Last year's Ultra model apparently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-ultra-s-pen-magsafe-qi2-malfunction">ran into some issues with magnets</a>, and this year, we're seeing similar warnings about magnetic cases interfering with the S Pen. We've reached out to Samsung for an explanation on why our Ultra model has begun warning us about the use of magnetic cases interfering with This is probably why we only see true Qi2 magnetic charging on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/hmd-skyline-qi2-launch">one Android phone</a>, while Samsung and OnePlus opt for optional cases.</p><p>Then there's the Razr Plus. And before you get too excited, it doesn’t feature magnetic charging or Qi2. However, it does come with magnets in the phone, which are likely used to help keep the phone closed when folded. Because of this, I can mimic using MagSafe by attaching it to magnetic wireless chargers or other MagSafe accessories like car mounts, all without a case.</p><p>Ever since finding this out, it got me excited about what Qi2 would look like on Android, especially if and when it arrived on future flip phones.</p>

<p>I've laid out the reason why <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-android-oems-can-improve-flip-phones">I don't like using cases on flip phones</a> like the Razr or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>, and it boils down to the fact that flip phones are quite thick when folded. Adding a case, while still a smart thing to do, just makes them much bulkier (with the exception of Thinborne or Fiberborne, which unfortunately don't make cases for the Razr).</p><p>The magnets aren’t very strong, so it’s not something you should rely on, as the Razr will often slide off a device. However, if the accessory has strong enough magnets, then it feels like MagSafe, and I admit that I like it a lot. Plus, on version 1.x Qi chargers, the Razr will still get 15W.</p><p>Is it enough for me to cry over the Galaxy S25 not having built-in magnets? No, especially because I don't run into the same thickness problems as I do with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phone</a>. And I imagine most people outside of anyone reading this probably don't care all that much about built-in magnetic charging, either.</p>

<p>If you're going to spend the amount of money it takes to purchase a Galaxy S25, then you should also budget to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-cases">purchase a case</a> and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-screen-protectors">screen protector</a>. It's all the rage, and everyone's doing it.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/368627/us-protective-case-usage-among-smartphone-owners/">2017 survey from Statista</a> revealed that 79% of respondents used a protective case on their phone. A more recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/weekend-poll-do-you-use-a-case-with-your-android-phone/">survey from Android Police</a> echoed the results, with an even higher percentage stating they use cases, particularly third-party options, and statistics tell us that the market for phone cases is only going to get bigger.</p><p>If you don't want one, that's your prerogative, and I commend your bravery. For those who plan to buy a Galaxy S25 with a case, you might as well look into getting one with magnets. Qi2 is merely a bonus in this case (pun intended), and regardless of whether you use a case or not, you'll still be getting the same tired 15W charging speed, it's just up to you whether you want your phone to stick to things or not.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Fiio did all the right things with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-ft5-review">planar FT5</a> and then the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-ft3-review">FT3</a> headphones, but as is the case with these things, it wasn't until the budget-focused FT1 showed up that I realized the magnitude of what the brand achieved. These closed-back headphones are easily among the best-sounding I've tested, and they're an unbelievable value. <br><br>You can get your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/FiiO-FT1-Closed-Back-Headphones-Detachable/dp/B0D9QD4Y2P">hands on the FT1 for $149 on Amazon</a>, and that's incredible when you consider the sound quality is in line with headsets that cost twice as much — it goes up against Meze's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/meze-99-classics-review">99 Classics</a>. The headphones are sold in walnut and beech wood shells, and while I got the walnut model, Fiio is predominantly selling the beech wood option globally.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="AjX2M4E8H24EjqG2bZWq9W" name="Fiio FT1" alt="Fiio FT1 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AjX2M4E8H24EjqG2bZWq9W.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Design is the obvious starting point with these headphones; while Fiio does a decent enough job in this area, the brand tends to focus on usability rather than aesthetics. With the FT1, it managed to nail both; the usage of solid wood shells to cover the outside of the headphones gives them an elegance that you just don't get with the FT3 and even the FT5, and they look fabulous.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="u8ueDmmkfFwsAAkhrWKW6W" name="Fiio FT1" alt="Fiio FT1 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/u8ueDmmkfFwsAAkhrWKW6W.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I'm not exaggerating when I say that this is the best-looking Fiio product by a considerable margin. The FT1 look just as evocative as the 99 Classics, and the build quality is among the best in this category. The FT1 feature a metal headband with sliding rails, and you get good adjustability. The headband is cushioned and has a fabric finish, and the headphones are light enough that there's no issue with fatigue even after extended use.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ikGGiQrS49kNGMvdjdpCDW" name="Fiio FT1" alt="Fiio FT1 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ikGGiQrS49kNGMvdjdpCDW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What I like the most about the FT1 is the oversized ear cups, and honestly, they make using the headphones that much more enjoyable. There's nothing about the FT1 that their price tag, and Fiio deserves full credit when it comes to the design and comfort. <br></p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="zf75P2FBx75PnKckgL4EDW" name="Fiio FT1" alt="Fiio FT1 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zf75P2FBx75PnKckgL4EDW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On that note, you get a decent set of accessories as well. Fiio bundles two cables — one with a 3.5mm plug and the other with 4.4mm — and you get a hard shell carrying case. Although the FT1 don't fold flat, the inclusion of the case means you can take these anywhere.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="J8Xa8NmDRBZff4s98aMrBW" name="Fiio FT1" alt="Fiio FT1 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/J8Xa8NmDRBZff4s98aMrBW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>After two months of extensive use, I didn't have any issues with the design or comfort of the FT1, and if anything, these are among the most comfortable headphones I've used in this category. There isn't any excessive clamping force, and the earpads are exquisite; they have generous padding and are very comfortable.</p>

<p>You get good passive isolation thanks to the closed-back design and decent seal with the earpads. Overall, the design is decidedly retro, but that's what makes the FT1 so enticing — they're differentiated enough that they immediately grab attention.</p>

<p>Coming to the sound, the FT1 feature a 60mm dynamic driver alongside a nanowood fiber composite diaphragm, and Fiio clearly made a lot of tweaks to the sound over the FT3. The result is that the FT1 sound absolutely incredible; I tested the headphones with the Fiio <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-btr13-is-a-budget-dac-that-lets-you-easily-upgrade-your-phone-audio">BTR13</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-m23-review">M23</a>, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-k19-review">K19 DAC</a> when using my Windows machine.</p>

<p>Bass in particular is delightful, with the FT1 managing to deliver terrific sub-bass and mid-bass. There are times when the bass gets a bit exaggerated, but it just adds to the liveliness of the sound — these aren't reference material. Mids are warm and delightful, and vocals shine through with plenty of clarity and vigor. You get a good sparkle with the treble, but there isn't any harshness.</p>

<p>I prefer the sound of the FT1 to the 99 Classics and even the FT3, and they hold up incredibly well for casual listening sessions. There isn't anything to criticize as such, and while they're not as neutral as Fiio's other products, the musical nature of the FT1 makes them a standout option. <br><br>Fiio just released the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/FiiO-FT1-Pro-Headphones-Sensitivity/dp/B0DM61CHW6">$199 FT1 Pro</a>, and they should be similarly great — I'll be getting started with these shortly. But if you need closed-back headphones with a distinctive look and amazing sound, the FT1 should be your go-to option in the sub-$300 category — the praise they've been getting is well-deserved.</p>

<ul><li>The Galaxy S24 Ultra broke into the top ten best-sellers list in 2024, marking a first for a Samsung flagship phone since 2019.</li><li>Samsung's focus on AI features and innovation helped the S24 Ultra stand out in the premium Android market, landing it in the ninth spot globally.</li><li>The Galaxy A15 took the crown as the best-selling Android phone across all price ranges, and the A15 5G became the top-selling 5G device worldwide.</li></ul>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> dominated the 2024 flagship Android market, topping sales charts and even being the only premium Android phone to crack the world's top ten best-sellers.</p><p>Samsung popping up in the yearly top ten best-selling phones list is pretty much a given. But its top-tier Galaxy S series hasn’t made the cut since 2018. That is, until now. According to Canalys’ latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/worldwide-smartphone-market-2024" target="_blank">report</a>, the flagship line is making a comeback, sneaking its way back into that elite ranking (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/03/samsung-galaxy-s24-sales-report-2024-top-10/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>Apple’s iPhone 15 rules the 2024 sales charts. But Samsung’s Galaxy S24 Ultra just ended a six-year slump, as per the report.</p><p>Snagging the ninth spot on the global best-sellers list, the Galaxy S24 Ultra’s win cements Samsung’s dominance in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">premium Android phone</a> segment.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:807px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:91.20%;"><img id="gMQQfUjPGQwhx4uonF52EH" name="Canalys-report" alt="Canalys report" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gMQQfUjPGQwhx4uonF52EH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="807" height="736" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Canalys)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>According to the report, the S24 Ultra’s strong sales come down to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai-sketch-to-image-multimodal-updates-teased">Samsung doubling down on AI features</a> and keeping the innovation game tight.</p><p>Apple and Samsung went head-to-head for smartphone supremacy in 2024, but Apple barely pulled ahead with 225.9 million shipments against Samsung’s 222.9 million. These numbers might change, but for now, it looks like Apple finally stole the crown as the world’s top smartphone brand.</p><p>While the Galaxy S24 Ultra grabbed the spotlight in the premium space, the Galaxy A15 stole the show as the best-selling Android phone across all price ranges. On top of that, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-a15-5g-review">Galaxy A15 5G</a> dominated the 5G market, becoming the top-selling 5G phone worldwide.</p><p>Even with solid specs, no premium models from Chinese brands like Honor, OnePlus, OPPO, Vivo, or Xiaomi managed to crack the best-sellers list.</p><p>Despite their absence from the list, Chinese OEMs still saw solid growth in 2024. Xiaomi stood out with an impressive 15% year-over-year jump, shipping over 168 million smartphones worldwide.</p><p>Overall, the global smartphone market saw a solid rebound in 2024, with shipments hitting 1.22 billion units, up 7%, according to Canalys. This recovery comes after two years of decline, driven by longer replacement cycles, smart restocking by vendors, and the ongoing growth of emerging markets.</p>

The BTR13 continues that trend, with the DAC slotting easily into Fiio's existing catalog. I thoroughly enjoyed using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-btr5-2021-review">BTR5</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-btr7-review">BTR7</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-btr15-review">BTR15</a>, and the BTR13 brings a new design and upgraded internals, alongside exciting extras. <br><br>As always, value is a key selling point with the DAC, and the BTR13 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/FiiO-BTR13-Bluetooth-Headphone-Unbalanced/dp/B0DF2WD5DG">available for just $69 on Amazon</a>. Fiio sells the product in blue and black color variants, and what's new this time is an integrated clip; Fiio bundled accessories in the past that let you hook the DAC to your belt or a bag, but with the BTR13 it's baked into the design.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="dCvizD4Zi53qStEK99dsG" name="Fiio BTR13" alt="Fiio BTR13 DAC" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dCvizD4Zi53qStEK99dsG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That means the BTR13 is thicker than its predecessors, but it is still inherently pocketable, and at just 28.6g, you won't even notice you're carrying it with you — that has been the case in my usage. Another differentiator is that you get a three-mode switch, allowing you to switch between PC, phone, and Bluetooth modes.</p>

<p>Talking about buttons, the BTR13 also comes with a volume rocker, multifunction button, and the standard power button. All of these are located on the right, and they have decent tactility in spite of the diminutive size. Connectivity is via Bluetooth 5.1 and USB-C, and you can easily use the BTR13 with your phone, Windows machine, or any other device that uses a USB-C port.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="mWvGGNZqKjskN6pAz3vG6" name="Fiio BTR13" alt="Fiio BTR13 DAC" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mWvGGNZqKjskN6pAz3vG6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As is the case with the rest of its DACs, Fiio went with a 3.5mm jack and balanced 4.4mm port on the BTR13. Conveniently, you get a 0.96-inch LCD panel at the front, and it shows volume, battery level, and whatever mode is in use along with codec information once you start music playback. Thanks to the built-in mic, you can use it while making calls.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vsprLHgEbDiMe85gCUBh3" name="Fiio BTR13" alt="Fiio BTR13 DAC" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vsprLHgEbDiMe85gCUBh3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's an integrated menu system, and while you'll need Fiio Control to make the most of the DAC, it isn't mandatory — you can adjust most of the settings from the unit itself, and that's a big plus point. You can easily adjust the gain, choose EQ modes, switch to a dedicated car mode, and change the language via the menu, and it is a good inclusion.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6Rhgz3w7d9Lqs9EWWbmi7" name="Fiio BTR13" alt="Fiio BTR13 DAC" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6Rhgz3w7d9Lqs9EWWbmi7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The BTR13 has a plastic chassis, and while it makes the DAC lighter, it doesn't quite have the same heft as the BTR15. That said, there are no issues with the build quality, and I didn't notice any problems in the two months I used the DAC. Coming to the internals, you get dual CS43131 DAC chipsets, and it is able to go up to 120mW at 16Ω, 100mW at 32Ω, and 10mW at 300Ω over the 3.5mm jack.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="sPZQQCrPC5PFmChyKdzeJ" name="Fiio BTR13" alt="Fiio BTR13 DAC" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sPZQQCrPC5PFmChyKdzeJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When going the balanced route, you get 130mW at 16Ω, 220mW at 32Ω, and 55mW at 300Ω, making the BTR13 a great choice to use with any IEMs. I tested it with the new FT1 headset and the FD15 dynamic drivers and the hybrid <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-fh11-review">FH11</a>, and it didn't have any issues driving the IEMs.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="DbyKg93vM2Yn7iT7pfTYE" name="Fiio BTR13" alt="Fiio BTR13 DAC" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DbyKg93vM2Yn7iT7pfTYE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The DAC features Qualcomm's QCC5125 Bluetooth modem, and it includes the full suite of AptX codecs, including AptX Adaptive, AptX Lossless, and AptX HD in addition to LDAC and the standard AAC and SBC. Battery life is decent as well, and you can get just over seven hours via the built-in 460mAh unit in phone mode. There's no fast charging, so it takes just over 90 minutes to charge the BTR13, and you'll need a 10W (5V/2A) charger.</p>
<p>A notable addition is 10-band PEQ adjustment, and if you're using the BTR13 with a Windows machine, you can use the feature via the web — no need to install a driver. That is highly nifty in its own right, and the granular control gives the DAC a distinct edge over other models in this series.</p>

<p>Coming to the sound, the BTR13 delivers a characteristic neutral signature with a hint of warmth. The overall tonality is smooth, with an easygoing low-end with good details, engaging mid-range, and clean treble. There isn't any harshness to the mix, and while the BTR15 does a better job with technicalities, the BTR13 is pretty great in its own right.</p>
<p>The tuning lends itself well to diverse genres, and the fact that you get extensive customizability when it comes to adjusting the tonal balance is a decent enough differentiator. That's one of the main reasons why the BTR13 is so good, and if you want a budget DAC that nails the connectivity and sound signature, this is a terrific choice.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google is running <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-shows-how-gemini-live-can-help-you-land-a-job-in-super-bowl-ad">a Super Bowl marketing campaign</a>, which highlights how 50 small businesses in 50 media markets use Gemini in Workspace to run their operations. The ads will air in the home media market of the small business highlighted in them this Sunday, Feb. 9, during the Super Bowl. However, in the case of Google's "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I18TD4GON8g">Wisconsin Cheese Mart: Gemini in Google Docs</a>" advertisement, it looks like the whole thing was a charade.</p><p>This specific commercial is just one of 50 that are part of the campaign, but it has been shrouded in controversy. First, it appeared that Google's Gemini AI got details in the showcase wrong. Gemini's output read that Gouda makes up "50 to 60 percent of the world's cheese consumption," which is incorrect, as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/606467/google-ai-super-bowl-ad-gouda-error-removed" target="_blank">The Verge</a>. Google quietly edited the advertisement to remove the incorrect claim from Gemini's response.</p><p>The original YouTube video link is live, and you can watch the ad below — but there's no sign it was edited aside from the slew of comments criticizing Google for the swap.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I18TD4GON8g" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Originally, critics suggested that Gemini's response may have been a hallucination. However, that doesn't seem to be the case — as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/jdischler/status/1885806962605957555" target="_blank">Google Cloud Apps President Jerry Dischler claimed on X</a>, saying it was "not a hallucination, Gemini is grounded in the Web."</p><p>Dischler appears to be right, but that's because Gemini never wrote the output in question at all. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/608188/google-fake-gemini-ai-output-super-bowl" target="_blank">The Verge</a>, the exact same original response allegedly written by Gemini appeared on the Wisconsin Cheese Mart's website description <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200807133049/https://www.wisconsincheesemart.com/products/gouda-cheese-smoked" target="_blank">as early as 2020</a> — almost three years before Google released Gemini, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-bard-gemini-rebrand-app-launch">then known as Bard</a>.</p><p>The commercial still passes off the output as being written by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>, despite the correction. Based on this information, it's likely the incorrect fact about Gouda was not an AI misstep — it was just a human one.</p><p>Android Central asked Google why it removed the incorrect Gouda stat from the original advertisement. We also asked whether it could confirm the output said to be written by Gemini was actually written by a human, and why it was said to be created by Gemini. Google did not immediately respond to our request, but we will update this article if we hear back.</p>

I think most people would have done the same.</p>
<p>I'd never really paid any attention to what the "Moto Widget" on my phone had to say. I like it because it's a big clock, not for any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/most-ac-readers-prefer-use-default-weather-app-their-phones">weather updates</a>. I wasn't expecting what happened when I did, though: I was directed to some Motorola system application (with an Ad at the bottom of it) and a red banner to click through for information about the storm.</p><p>Tapping through that, I was hit with a full-screen ad. A particularly scummy ad with only an "Open" button for a website. To close it you had to tap the X in the upper right.</p><p>I said, and I quote, "<em>Hunh"</em>. it's got to be because I'd never used it before or something and they can't force an ad on you every time you tap that thing. I tried like 20 more times and learned I was wrong. You are forced to click past a full-screen advertisement each and every time you tap the damn thing.</p>

<p>This is absurd. I was sitting warm and cozy on my butt and checked the weather, but what if I were out in that ... slop? I get it that nobody is going to be driving into an ice storm and checking its current location from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-auto-review">behind the wheel,</a> so this isn't really life and death, but still. There has to be boundaries. Motorola crosses them here.</p><p>I dislike ads, to begin with, but I do think they are acceptable in a lot of cases. Broadcast television and radio stations need some way to pay the bills and stay in business so they don't disappear like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHFS_(historic)" target="_blank">WHFS</a> did. I miss that station. No content is actually free, you either pay with money, time, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-collects-10x-much-data-ios-because-it-offers-10x-much-usability">data</a>, but "free" content can have some well-thought-out ads.</p><p>Yes, I know Android Central has ads, and sometimes they don't seem very well thought out. When one of our ad networks gets loopy, we have a team that finds out why and fixes it asap. We show ads for free content to help pay the bills, but we don't want them to be horrible or poorly-timed ads.</p><p>Mistakes aside, there are some situations where ads are simply unacceptable. Paying for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/amazon-prime-video-multiview-code-spotted">Amazon Prime Video</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/amazon-prime-video-introduces-ads">getting ads</a> is wrong. Ditto for any paid streaming service. If your content is worth it, charge $1 more a month for it instead. Putting ads into the system software of any consumer electronics you paid full price for is even worse.</p><p>It's terrible and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-turn-ads-your-samsung-phone">stupid when Samsung does it</a>. It's also terrible and stupid when Motorola does it. It almost makes me want to stop using this phone out of spite, and it's one of the best phones I ever had.</p><p>Motorola, Samsung, Google, and the rest of the players are tracking your every move anytime you use your phone. There is no need to display any forced ads on a device that costs hundreds and hundreds of dollars.</p>

<ul><li>Google was reportedly spotted adding code to the first Android 16 beta regarding the user's ability to rebind keyboard shortcuts.</li><li>From the code, users can alter the combinations required to launch apps or to activate Android's system controls.</li><li>Google introduced a physical keyboard toolbar for shortcuts on Android last year while also bringing updates for it to Workspace apps.</li><li>Android 16 beta 1 kicked off a couple of weeks ago, which was anticipated as Google looks to launch the software in Q2 2025.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A recent Android discovery suggests Google is gearing up to further evolve the keyboard experience for larger devices.</p><p>As spotted by Mishaal Rahman (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-16-customizable-keyboard-shortcuts-3524017/">Android Authority</a>), the next iteration of Android's OS could include the ability to rework your keybinds. Nothing is for sure; however, Rahaman noticed a large, new chunk of code in Android 16's testing under a "Customize Keyboard Shortcut" tag.</p><p>So far, the only information Google has in its code are the basics: "press key to assign shortcut," "customize," and "remove shortcut" among error codes for combos and a cancel option.</p><p>Google already lets users who've attached physical keyboards access shortcuts via a plethora of key combinations. However, the new code suggests users may be able to swap those around for new combinations using previously mapped keys.</p><p>As Rahman speculates, the ability to rebind keyboard shortcuts will likely apply to apps and system controls. A few examples include opening programs like Chrome or Gmail, as well as other actions like screenshots, notification menus, and more.</p><p>Thecode was reportedly added to the first Android 16 beta for enrolled testers. Additionally, Rahman claims that this remapping function seems limited to altering what's already provided to users. The publication is unsure if users will have the ability to create entirely new keyboard combos for shortcuts.</p>

<p>Google has been paying closer attention to the physical keyboard experience of its bigger Android devices since it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/gboard-physical-keyboard-toolbar-tablets-rollout">added a more intuitive toolbar</a>. Last year, the company pushed a Gboard update that brought a physical toolbar to users with USB-C or Bluetooth keyboards. When attaching the accessory, users would notice a floating pill-shaped bar at the bottom of their displays.</p><p>Tapping it would produce Android's wide array of app shortcuts and system action keys. Users could also customize the new toolbar by toggling it on/off or adding the emoji keyboard to the mix. Google highlighted the ability for users to access translation tools from this bar, as well as your clipboard for copied content.</p><p>Another update hit larger devices using physical keyboards last summer, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gmail-chat-foldable-tablet-updates-2024">involved Google's Workspace apps</a> like Gmail and Chat.</p><p>In other news, Google dropped <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-beta-1-released-enrolled-pixels-detailed">Android 16 Beta 1</a> for enrolled Pixel testers in mid-January. We got a glimpse at the company's other efforts at improving large Android device experiences via "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/01/orientation-and-resizability-changes-in-android-16.html" target="_blank">app adaptability."</a> This is essentially a piece of code that ensures that users on foldables or tablets will see their apps displayed properly, across their entire screen as a ratio that keeps everything clear and sharp.</p><p>There's no hiding the fact that Android 16 is supposed to drop far earlier than usual as Google eyes a Q2 2025 launch.</p>

<hr>
<p>The next Motorola Razr was spotted running through its benchmark test and it seemingly confirms a key specification.</p><p>The Motorola Razr Plus 2025, was reportedly spotted in a Geekbench listing by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://xpertpick.com/news/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-spotted-on-geekbench-launch-expected-soon/">Xpertpick</a> with details about its expected power levels. The key highlight of this Geekbench listing is the included CPU specs, which suggest a familiar Qualcomm chip. The performance test shows the Razr Plus 2025 features a CPU with two cores at 4.32GHz and six other cores at 3.53GHz.</p><p>Specifications like this may seem familiar and that's because they match Qualcomm's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> SoC. So, it's likely the first two cores are the SD 8 Elite's Prime cores, leaving the other six as its Performance cores.</p><p>Regarding the official test, the next Razr Plus scored 2,782 in its single-core assessment and 8,457 in the multi-core portion.</p><p>Other specifications found in the listing claim the clamshell will see the Adreno 830 GPU alongside the chipset. Additionally, Geekbench states the device sports 10.9GB of memory; however, the publication claims this <em>should </em>regard its RAM total, in which case that number is most likely 12GB officially.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="o5sMvGSFcxEQa2ffzxpYrP" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-review-19.jpg" alt="The Motorola Razr Plus 2024 main display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o5sMvGSFcxEQa2ffzxpYrP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Rumors about the next Moto Razr Plus had been relatively quiet until <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-60-ultra-early-database-certification-spotted">leaks surfaced in January</a>. The device was supposedly spotted receiving its BIS certification in India, potentially indicating an earlier launch in 2025. Any alleged renderings have yet to appear — which is what happened first last year ahead of its BIS cert. There's speculation that the Razr Plus 2025 could continue the same design trend that Motorola has stuck with for the past couple of generations.</p><p>However, those early rumors claimed the device could sport the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8s-elite-cores-power-leak">Snapdragon 8s Elite</a>, which is rumored to be a watered-down version of the flagship SoC. The reason behind the rumors is that the 2024 foldable grabbed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8s-gen-3-announced">Snapdragon 8s Gen 3</a>, which was a toned-down version of the SD 8 Gen 3. With the current Geekbench listing, it seems Motorola is finally trying to push its foldable into a more flagship-level aspect than years prior.</p><p>It does leave one wondering if this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-successor-price-rumors">will cause the price</a> of the Moto Razr Plus 2025 to go up.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>If you&apos;ve been following my work for a while, you&apos;ll know that I&apos;m a big fan of Sony&apos;s WH-1000XM4 headphones, and I will jump on the chance to recommend them every time a new deal crops up. Well, today is no exception. </p><p>For the first time since the Black Friday and Cyber Monday sale events last fall, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM4-Canceling-Headphones-Phone-Call/dp/B08MVGF24M"><strong>Amazon is slashing a straight $100 off my beloved headphones, knocking the price down to $248</strong></a> for a limited time.</p><p>Sure, many will argue that the XM4 aren&apos;t the absolute <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">best wireless headphones</a> on the market, nor are they the newest model from Sony (that honor belongs to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/headphones/sony-wh-1000xm5-review">WH-1000XM5</a>). But I love the XM4 because they&apos;re so perfectly balanced: not too expensive, great-sounding, with awesome battery life and enough customizable settings to keep even the most particular audiophiles happy. </p>
<div class="product"><a data-dimension112="97f4048a-1621-4e85-9521-58078d883f85" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$348" data-dimension48="$348" href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM4-Canceling-Headphones-Phone-Call/dp/B08MVGF24M" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1010px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:148.51%;"><img id="MLd3qNyrJeNVCZPHAph2M" name="Sony WH-1000XM4.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MLd3qNyrJeNVCZPHAph2M.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1010" height="1500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Sony WH-1000XM4:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM4-Canceling-Headphones-Phone-Call/dp/B08MVGF24M" data-dimension112="97f4048a-1621-4e85-9521-58078d883f85" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$348" data-dimension48="$348"><del>$348</del> <strong>$248 at Amazon</strong></a></p>
<p>Head to Amazon right now and you'll score a straight 29% off the Sony WH-1000XM4, a stylish and versatile pair of wireless headphones that I use every day for meetings, noise cancellation, podcasts, and more. This is the first major discount that the headphones have received since last fall, so it's a good time to buy if you missed all the Black Friday festivities. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM4-Canceling-Headphones-Phone-Call/dp/B08MVGF24M" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="97f4048a-1621-4e85-9521-58078d883f85" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$348" data-dimension48="$348">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>Despite their slightly advanced age, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/sony-wh-1000xm4-review">Sony WH-1000XM4</a> headphones remain an excellent choice for most listeners, with active noise cancellation (ANC), up to 30 hours of battery life, and loads of customizable EQ settings in the companion app. They also collapse and travel better than the newer Sony XM5, and I can personally attest to their comfort — I typically wear them for my entire work day to listen to music and drown out background noise. </p><p>Of course, the XM4 aren&apos;t for everyone. They&apos;re a bit too hot if you&apos;re looking for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones-working-out">workout headphones</a>, and $250 might still be a bit steep if you just want a simple pair of headphones (some models by Beats will go for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Solo-Wireless-Headphones-Matte/dp/B0CZPLV566/"><strong>considerably less</strong></a>, for instance). </p><p>It&apos;s also worth noting that the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/deals">spring sales</a> may drop the newer XM5 to just slightly above this price, so if you want the latest and greatest from Sony, it might be worth the wait. But with that said, if you&apos;re looking for a premium headphones experience that costs less <em>today</em>, then this deal presents an excellent opportunity. </p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung is sending its Galaxy S24 users into the weekend with some bad news: One UI 7 is getting pushed back — once again.</p><p>Late Thursday night (Feb 6), prominent tipster Ice Universe <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1887731496863306019">posted a snapshot</a> of a Samsung community member's message about the One UI 7 test (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/07/samsung-holds-off-one-ui-7-rollout-more-beta/">9to5Google</a>). The publication machine-translated it, which unearths a staggering issue: the presence of a bug that affects a user's display. According to Samsung, this bug "causes the display color temperature to appear more yellow than intended."</p><p>The company adds that this is a result of the "Natural" screen color optimization mode on the S24.</p><p>This bug was apparently discovered during Beta 3, to which the community member states it will be patched in the upcoming Beta 4. While most users were eagerly anticipating an official rollout of One UI 7 following the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/icymi-samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2025-biggest-announcements-and-reveals">Galaxy S25 launch</a>, it looks like that's not happening.</p><p>As Samsung prepares the next beta, it recommends that users experiencing this yellowish screen problem deactivate color optimization. While there is another beta en route, Ice Universe claims the "official version is still a long way off."</p><p>It's not clear what this means as Samsung can drop patches one week after the other. Moreover, if this screen issue is the only glaring problem, we could still see One UI 7 arrive in February.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Galaxy S24 series One UI 7.0 will release the Beta4 version, and the official version is still a long way off. pic.twitter.com/pGT6EnI6EJ<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1887731496863306019">February 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>There's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/dreary-one-ui-7-beta-forum-update">a long trail</a> you can follow regarding <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-pushed-back-again">the extensive delays</a> One UI 7 has faced since last year. Last September, Samsung had reportedly pushed the original start of its Android 15 software back due to stability issues. The company was also said to be discussing the features to rope into the OS upgrade, which could've involved its slew of on-device AI.</p><p>A couple of months later, Samsung pushed its One UI 7 start into December due to bugs in the software. That November notice reportedly dealt with bugs within the code that crippled the beta's start, forcing the OEM to shove it further down the road.</p><p>Fast-forward to February 2025 and we're still hearing the same thing: software bugs.</p><p>For now, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-s24-series-one-ui-7-beta-3-roll-out">we have Beta 3</a> to experiment with, which launched at the start of January. Typical for Samsung's betas, Beta 3 hauled in a host of fixes for issues Galaxy S24 testers found throughout its duration. A few of those enhancements were for the Game Booster mode alongside a feature addition for Samsung Messages.</p><p>Keep in mind: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-confirms-one-ui-7-galaxy-s-phones-rollout-soon">Samsung confirmed</a> that One UI 7 would hit past-gen Galaxy S devices "imminently" toward the end of January. The company said the software should arrive on its phones in Q1 2025, which leaves the rest of February and March before that statement's out the window. The One UI 7 update is expected to bring the Personal Data Engine and the Now Bar to older S-series phones.</p>

Android also powers Fire OS on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/amazon-fire-tv">Fire TV devices</a>, but a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.lowpass.cc/p/amazon-vega-os-fire-tv-android" target="_blank">report</a> back in 2023 signaled that Amazon was ditching Android in favor of a new software platform.</p><p>More than a year later, there's evidence to suggest that Amazon isn't quite ready to move on from Android for Fire TVs just yet. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.aftvnews.com/android-14-is-coming-to-future-fire-tvs-confirmed-by-amazon/" target="_blank">AFTVnews</a> found a few pieces of developer documentation on official Amazon sites referencing an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14-based build</a> for Fire TVs, and it's the first hint we've gotten that Android might live on a little longer on the platform (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/06/amazon-fire-tv-android-14-builds/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>One support document, titled "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.developer.amazon.com/docs/fire-tv/android-14-based-fire-tv.html" target="_blank">Developing for Amazon Fire TV Devices Running Android 14</a>," is all about the upgrade.</p><p>"Android 14-based Fire TV is based on API level 34. The following sections explain some of important changes that you should consider when you build apps for Android 14-based Fire TV," the support document explains. "The migration to standard Android components in the following sections will help reduce the risk of compatibility issues and provide ease of maintenance for your app."</p><p>Currently, there isn't a Fire OS version based on Android 14 available for current hardware. It's possible that the support document is prepping for new Fire TV hardware with Android 14 at its core, or that it's getting ahead of a future upgrade.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="i6iR2DBfGmPCMmHWCD4RQD" name="Amazon-Fire-TV-Omni-Series-65-lifestyle-16x9-03.jpg" alt="Amazon Fire TV Omni Series - 65-inch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/i6iR2DBfGmPCMmHWCD4RQD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Chris Wedel/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Either way, this is the closest thing we've gotten to an official confirmation that there will be another Fire OS version based on Android 14. According to prior reports, and based on the fact that Amazon's Echo smart displays have seemingly switched over to the new Vega OS, it wasn't a given that Android would live on in Fire OS.</p><p>Another support document, titled "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.amazon.com/docs/fire-tv/fire-os-overview.html" target="_blank">Fire OS Overview</a>," lists "<strong>(Android Open Source Project) AOSP 14</strong>: Based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/14">Android 14</a> (API level 34)" as an official Fire OS version. This further supports the possibility of Android 14 debuting in a new Fire OS upgrade, or on new Fire TV hardware.</p><p>However, this is hardly an official announcement of an Android 14-based Fire OS version, so we'll have to keep an eye on whether this newer version of Android debuts on Fire TVs in the future.</p>

<p>The preorder period may be over, but there are still plenty of great Samsung Galaxy S25 deals to check out. From free gift cards and trade-in credit to leftover preorder promos, keep reading for all of the best Galaxy S25 deals from across the web.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy S25 lineup</a> features a new AI-integrated operating system with upgraded camera tech and an ultra-durable Gorilla Armor 2 glass-and-aluminum construction. Like the S24 series, the phones are also guaranteed to receive seven years of OS and security updates, and perhaps best of all, there’s been no increase to the retail price of any of the devices (I wish I could say the same about a few other recent flagships). Still, the phones aren't exactly cheap, which is why the following deals are so crucial for shoppers. The reviews are live and the phones have landed, so what are you waiting for?</p>

<ul><li>Evan Blass has shared leaked renders of the Oppo Find N5 from new angles, revealing the foldable's design.</li><li>Oppo previously shared official teasers for the Find N5, but those didn't show the device's overall build.</li><li>The Oppo Find N5 is expected to debut in North America as the OnePlus Open 2.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Oppo is teasing its next foldable, the Oppo Find N5, and specifically calling out its thinness compared to the competition. Just yesterday, the company showed off <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-ceo-teases-find-n5-less-visible-crease-official">the lack of a visible crease on the Oppo Find N5</a> in a social media post. However, none of these official teasers have shown off every color of the Find N5, which is what Evan Blass delivered in leaked renders on his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://evleaks.substack.com/p/oppo-find-n5" target="_blank">Substack</a>.</p><p>The leaked renders reveal that Oppo will offer the Find N5 in black, white, and purple colorways. It looks similarly to the Oppo Find N3, with a large circular rear camera system and an Oppo logo etched in the back. The front shows off the more material changes, including display glass that blends directly into the frame and hinge.</p><p>This is yet another clue that the Find N5, rumored to measure just 4.2mm when unfolded, will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppos-find-n5-could-be-even-thinner-than-the-magic-v3-and-thats-a-big-deal">be the thinnest and most compact foldable yet</a>.

<p>However, if these leaks are correct, the Oppo Find N5 might not have such a metal frame bezel on the left side of the foldable. This would make the Find N5 much easier to use left-handed, as a large frame or bezel requires lefties to reach further to get to certain parts of the cover screen.</p><p>The Oppo Find N5 is expected to also arrive in North America as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-2">OnePlus Open 2</a>, just like the Find N3 and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">original Open</a>. OnePlus' variant will include slight tweaks, like a revamped camera arrangement, and could include new colorways and finish option. For example, the first Open was available in a vegan leather back.</p><p>For the most part, the OnePlus Open 2 should just be a rebadged version of the Oppo Find N5. If recent leaks and teasers are any indication, that probably isn't a bad thing.</p>

<hr>
<p>Pebble, the fondly-remembered lightweight smartwatch with basic features and long battery life, is making a comeback. Last week, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/hell-yeah-theyre-bringing-pebble-watches-back">Google open-sourced PebbleOS</a>, and Pebble's founder Eric Migicovsky vowed to get it running on new hardware. That effort is already underway, and an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ericmigi.com/blog/how-to-help-build-open-source-pebble-software" target="_blank">update</a> from Migicovsky reveals that the Core Devices team has already gotten PebbleOS working on fresh components.</p><p>As you can see in the image below, the open-sourced PebbleOS is running on a test board with a small, monochromatic screen. Migicovsky's team at Core Devices LLC, a new company, includes a Rebble board member and Cobble developer. Other original Pebble contributors are helping out as part of the project to revive the brand, too.</p><p>For hardware, Migicovsky warns smartwatch fans not to get their hopes up. "It’s going to be a Pebble and almost exactly as you remember it, except now with open source software that can you can modify and improve yourself," writes Migicovsky on his blog. "More hardware details will be shared in the future."</p><p>As of now, the RePebble project team is exploring the nRF52840 chipset for hardware. The silicon has a 64 MHz Cortex-M4 with FPU, 1 MB Flash, 256 KB RAM, a 2.4 GHz Transceiver, Bluetooth Low Energy, and Bluetooth mesh, according to a listing for the chip on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/nRF52840" target="_blank">Nordic Semiconductor</a>.</p>

<p>The next step for Pebble's revival is for the team to start exploring what it would take to build new hardware for PebbleOS. Migicovsky is traveling to Shenzhen, China to meet with factories and suppliers for the hardware next week. In his original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://repebble.com" target="_blank">RePebble announcement</a>, Migicovsky wrote: "If enough people are interested, we'll build it."</p><p>Now that PebbleOS is open-sourced, the community can help with the project. There are small, medium, and big projects listed on Migicovsky's blog post that developers or tinkerers of any skill level can try out. All updates to PebbleOS are hosted on the Core Devices LLC's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/coredevices/pebble" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>.</p><p>It's all possible thanks to Google's work open-sourcing PebbleOS. "Thank you again to Google for this huge contribution to the Pebble community," Migicovsky writes.</p><p>If you've forgotten about Pebble over the years, or are hearing about it for the first time, check out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/pebble-time-review">Android Central's review of the Pebble Time back in 2015</a>.</p>

LaCie is setting loftier goals with its latest product, the Rugged Pro5 SSD. While the SSD looks similar in design to older models, it has Thunderbolt 5 connectivity, and is able to go up to a ridiculous 6700MB/s when reading data, and writes crossing 5300MB/s.</p>
<p>To put that into context, that's at least five times faster than what most external SSDs — like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/sk-hynixs-2tb-beetle-x31-is-my-new-favorite-external-ssd">Beetle X31</a> and Samsung T9 — can manage. The Rugged Pro5 SSD is aimed at content creators, has a 50GB cache buffer, and enables editing 8K or 6K videos on Thunderbolt 5 devices without any slowdowns.</p>

<p>LaCie sells the Rugged Pro5 SSD in a 2TB variant <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1871606-REG/lacie_stna2000400_2tb_rugged_ssd_pro.html">that retails for $399</a>, and there's a 4TB model (the one I'm using) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1871607-REG/lacie_stna4000400_4tb_rugged_ssd_pro.html">that costs $599</a>. The brand includes a one-month membership to Adobe's Creative Cloud All Apps plan when you register the drive, a $59 value — the deal is valid if you're an existing Adobe user.</p>

<p>Right now, Thunderbolt 5 is limited to the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros with M4 Pro and M4 Max silicon, and the 2024 refresh of the Mac Mini with M4 Pro. I use a custom Windows gaming machine that has Thunderbolt 4 connectivity, and that's what I used to test the drive.</p><p>I can't do a full-fledged review of the drive at this time as I don't have Thunderbolt 5 devices on hand, but I'm aiming to change that relatively soon, and will add synthetic scores as soon as I get the M4 Pro-based Mac Mini. With that out of the way, let's get started.</p>

<p>The Rugged Pro5 SSD looks similar to earlier models, but that doesn't mean it's any less distinctive. If anything, the vibrant blue hue makes the drive immediately stand out, and the rugged casing — designed by noted Scottish designer Neil Poulton — allows the drive to take a beating. Seagate says the drive is usable after being driven over by a 2-ton car, and while I didn't test that particular claim, I have no doubts about the durability of the drive.</p>

<p>In addition to being run over by a car, the Rugged Pro5 SSD can withstand three-meter tumbles, and it has IP68 ingress protection — the same as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>. That means the drive is immune to dust ingress, and it can be submerged in up to 1.5 meters of water up to 30 minutes without any issues.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="zUr4M9Mqh22cSe6f7NQgQT" name="LaCie Rugged Pro5 SSD" alt="LaCie Rugged Pro5 SSD back view against blue background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zUr4M9Mqh22cSe6f7NQgQT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In spite of the rugged chassis, the SSD is easily pocketable, and coming in at 150g, it doesn't weigh much either. The drive connects over USB-C and leverages Thunderbolt 5, and LaCie includes a Thunderbolt 5 cable with the package. The cable is just 0.3m long, and it was adequate for my use case — connecting to a multitude of phones, tablets, and my Windows machine.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="TgjoW7Brd7Gc3XBB8RnGeT" name="LaCie Rugged Pro5 SSD" alt="LaCie Rugged Pro5 SSD next to X9 Pro, X10 Pro, and other external SSDs" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TgjoW7Brd7Gc3XBB8RnGeT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Thunderbolt 5 standard has increased bandwidth going up to 80Gbps, but the drive works just as well over Thunderbolt 4's 40Gbps, and USB-C at 40Gbps, 20Gbps, and 10Gbps. I got sequential reads of 1810MB/s and writes of 1800MB/s over Thunderbolt 4, and similar bandwidth over USB 4. Because of the cache buffer, writes go down after you cross the 50GB limit, but this makes a bigger difference over Thunderbolt 5.</p><p>The enclosed nature of the design means it gets a little warm after extended transfers, but it is in line with other external SSDs I've tested.</p>

<p>If anything, the Rugged Pro5 SSD proved to be overkill for most of my use cases, which include transferring media from phones, moving data to and from the iPad Pro and my Windows machine. It was effortless at these tasks, and I had no issues using the drive with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Honor Magic 7 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-12-ultra-review">ASUS Zenfone 12 Ultra</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a>, and iPad Pro M4 2024.</p>
<p>Even though I wasn't able to test the drive to its full potential, it is noticeably faster than any other external SSD I tested. The drive is at a premium because of the rugged design and unmatched connectivity, and if you work with 8K/6K video and have bandwidth-heavy data needs, I can't think of another drive that's as good.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>A few years after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-announced-europe">expanding into Europe</a>, Honor is hoping the flagship Magic 7 Pro will convince even more users to give the brand a try outside of China. With advanced silicon-carbon battery tech, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite processor</a>, and growing AI software, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Honor Magic 7 Pro</a> might make a compelling case. The smartphone race outside of North America is often won by a device's camera system — just look at what brands like Vivo are doing — so if Honor wants to win, it'll need the Magic 7 Pro to deliver standout camera performance.</p><p>I've spent the last few weeks pushing the Magic 7 Pro's "Falcon Camera" to its limits, snapping shots and taking videos across two continents. Honor sent me to Bled, Slovenia for the Magic 7 Pro global launch event, where I got to test this phone's camera while scaling the Slovenian Alps, visiting ski slops, and riding ATVs. Back home, I tried out the Magic 7 Pro camera system in the completely-different desert terrain of Phoenix, Arizona.</p><p>So, how does the Honor Magic 7 Pro camera perform? It's tricky, because the raw camera hardware is downright impressive. For instance, the telephoto camera has a large sensor size and a high megapixel count, increasing its versatility. The problem is that the Falcon camera's AI engine can be both overreaching and underwhelming at times, and some of Honor's claims — like the 100x AI Super Zoom — should be taken with more than a few grains of salt.</p><p>All told, the Honor Magic 7 Pro does have some of the best camera systems available in a flagship. It's not quite at the level of Vivo handsets, but it's closer than ever. And for the second straight year, the Honor Magic flagship takes the best motion shots of any smartphone.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-main-camera"><span>Main camera</span></h2>
<p>Like most Android flagships, the Magic 7 Pro has a "pro" camera mode that lets you view and tweak just about every setting. However, the truth is that most users will take photos using the simple point-and-shoot method, and that's how I tested the Honor Magic 7 Pro as a result.</p><p>You'll immediately notice that opening the camera and snapping a photo is quicker than ever on an Honor phone, because the Magic 7 Pro <em>finally</em> supports double-clicking the power button to launch the camera from anywhere. This was shockingly not available on the Magic 6 Pro, and something my colleague Nicholas Sutrich pointed out in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-camera-review#section-honor-magic-6-pro-camera-main-camera">last year's camera review</a>. Now that this has been corrected, it takes merely a second or two to take a picture with the Magic 7 Pro.</p><p>Most of the photos you'll take with this phone will be with the main camera. It uses a 50MP, f/1.4-2.0 wide lens with multi-directional phase detection autofocus (PDAF) and optical image stabilization (OIS). This appears to be mostly the same sensor as Honor used in the Magic 6 Pro.</p>

<p>All modern flagship camera phones — from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review" target="_blank">Google Pixel 9 Pro</a> to the iPhone 16 Pro to the Galaxy S24 Ultra and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review" target="_blank">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> — have large main camera sensors that can provide a great level of detail in shots. One thing that separates these phones, more than detail, is their ability to handle light and color.</p><p>I've really enjoyed how the Honor Magic 7 Pro has performed in this aspect. I've tested the latest Pixel phones to produce photos with poor color accuracy and overaggressive computational photography. By comparison, the Honor imaging engine performs closer to that of Apple's or Samsung's, and that's a good thing. The colors captured in the photos above felt representative of what I was seeing with my own eyes.</p><p>Even on a sunny day, the main sensor was able to capture the moment without losing detail or color accuracy due to overexposure. These shots represent the best of what the Honor Falcon camera can do — it performs excellently during the daytime with limited to no AI processing needed.</p><p>I also want to mention that the best AI features, at least where photos are concerned, may not involve computational photography at all. The third image in the gallery above is of a Slovenian plaque, one that is significantly deteriorated and written in a language I can't natively read. After snapping the picture with the Magic 7 Pro, I was able to use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> to translate the text and make sense of it — even without having the full text. To me, this is a much better use of AI than changing the physical attributes of a photo.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-telephoto-ultrawide-camera"><span>Telephoto & ultrawide camera</span></h2>
<p>Once a shortcoming for Honor, the Magic 7 Pro's telephoto camera is now a selling point for the device. Last year, the Magic 6 Pro had a telephoto lens that could only do 2.5x optical zoom, which paled in comparison to the 10x optical zoom of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-review-understated-grandeur">Galaxy S23 Ultra</a> or the 5x optical zoom of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15 Pro Max</a>. Now, the Honor Magic 7 Pro's telephoto camera can deliver optical-quality zoom at 6x, which is right in line with the top Android zoom lenses.</p><p>The way Honor achieves this is a little outside the box, but in my testing, it works. The brand is using a 200MP, f/2.6 periscope telephoto lens with a 1/1.4-inch sensor size and native 3x optical zoom. Compared to last year, the Magic 7 Pro has greater optical zoom capabilities and a higher megapixel count. More importantly, the large sensor size and high megapixel count means the image can be cropped in software without a loss in quality — this is how Honor can deliver 6x zoom in "optical quality."</p><p>This unique telephoto sensor also enables the Magic 7 Pro's zoom lens to be used for portrait mode, which is neat. In the image gallery below, you'll see how the Magic 7 Pro performs across 0.5x, 1x, 2x, 3x, and 6x zoom levels. Based on the results, it's clear this phone can indeed deliver optical-level zoom at both 3x and 6x lengths.</p>

<p>The first photo in that set was taken at 0.5x with the Magic 7 Pro's ultrawide camera, which is a 50MP, f/2.0 sensor with a 122-degree field of view. I personally find myself using ultrawide cameras the least out of modern phone lenses, and this one performs about as expected. It captures a wider frame while not losing too much detail and should be a feasible alternative to the old-school panorama.</p><p>Beyond the standard zoom distances (0.5x-6x), the Magic 7 Pro is claimed to shoot up to 100x using a mix of digital zoom and AI enhancements. The feature is called "AI Super Zoom," and while cool, I wouldn't count on it. For starters, only zoom shots up to 30x can be processed on-device, while AI Super Zoom (up to 100x) requires a cellular connection for processing. This might be a deterrent for you or be outside your comfort level.</p><p>Even when AI Super Zoom is available, it's a bit slow, and you can only do it immediately after you take the shot. It'd be nice if you could do so after the fact, kind of like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-video-boost-pixel-8-pro">how Google's Video Boost works for Pixels</a>. Moreover, results can be mixed at best, as you can see below.</p>

<p>The first set of photos in the gallery above can give you an idea of the best-case scenario for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-jabs-samsung-highlights-magic-7-pro-upgrades">AI Super Zoom</a>. The original photo is blurry, grainy, and it's hard to make out the details. Meanwhile, the AI Super Zoom version looks a lot sharper, even if it's a bit <em>too</em> sharp to be a natural photo.</p><p>On the other hand, the second set of photos can represent some of the worst-case scenarios. With AI Super Zoom, all the detailed and sharp cuts in the snow were completely covered up by broad-stroking AI enhancement. The first-aid logo on the snowmobile was lost to the enhancement as well. It's clear that, after multiple tests, AI Super Zoom may be just as likely to make a photo worse with a watercolor-like image void of detail.</p><p>Overall, I thought native shots from the ultrawide and telephoto lens looked sharp, but AI Super Zoom wasn't quite as good as advertised.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-low-light-motion-capture"><span>Low-light & motion capture</span></h2>
<p>It's time to give the Honor Magic 7 Pro its flowers: this is the best motion-capture camera phone I've ever tested. At a time when the last <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S24 series</a> had serious motion blur issues, and the iPhone 16 Pro series has more motion blur than any iPhone in recent memory, the Magic 7 Pro couldn't be more different. It snaps clear photos of subjects in motion consistently, whether you're using the regular camera mode or one specialized for motion.</p>

<p>As you can see in the images above, whether I was capturing a darting pet, a steady Gondola lift, or a skier, the Magic 7 Pro delivered a clear shot. If you hate motion blur, this is the camera phone for you.</p><p>Honor has a few shooting modes specifically for capturing motion. There's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-honor-magic-6-pro-ai-motion-photos">AI Motion Sensing Capture</a>, which was introduced last year and can take photos for you when a subject moves.

<p>Low-light performance is a bit shakier, depending on the situation. Honor deserves some credit for not adding a ton of light to night shots on the Magic 7 Pro, to be clear. Whenever I take night shots with an iPhone or Pixel and come back to them a few months later, it's hard to see that it really was a night from the artificial brightness of the image. With the Magic 7 Pro, shots are dark, but they can be <em>too</em> dark at times.</p>

<p>The good news is that the Magic 7 Pro camera adjusts quickly to changes in lighting; it can adjust exposure and light balance within a second or two after opening the camera app. In my testing, there wasn't much of a difference when using night mode versus standard mode. You can pick up on some differences, particularly with bright light sources — like a streetlamp or lighted sign.</p>

<p>In the comparisons above, you'll see that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-camera-astrophotography-manual-control">night mode</a> tries to mute these bright light sources. However, I wasn't entirely thrilled with the results — Honor's processing seems to smoothen out the light sources in a way that's clearly unnatural. For that reason, I often preferred the original shot over the night shot.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-front-facing-camera"><span>Front-facing camera</span></h2>
<p>I'll be the first to admit that I'm not that big a user of the front-facing camera on smartphones. With that being said, if you love selfies, video calls, or social media, the Magic 7 Pro's front camera can do the job. It has a 50MP, f/2.0 sensor with PDAF, which is more than you'd typically see on a front-facing sensor. Honor also put a depth sensor beside the camera for biometrics, and this explains the pill-shaped cutout in the display.</p>

<p>Selfies and portrait shots turned out well, not only capturing me but also some of the details in the landscapes behind me. When using portrait mode, bokeh is still turned off by default, so keep that in mind if you enjoy background blur. It only takes one tap to turn bokeh on, but you could argue that's one more tap than it should take with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-take-better-portrait-photos-your-smartphone">portrait mode</a> active.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-video"><span>Video</span></h2>
<p>Considering the motion capture performance of the Magic 7 Pro, it shouldn't be a surprise that this phone also handles video quite well. It officially supports 4K resolution at either 60 or 30fps, which isn't industry-leading for a flagship but is still more than capable.</p><p>For video, the Honor Magic 7 Pro uses electronic image stabilization (EIS). This isn't usually a good thing because EIS is often less reliable and more jarring than OIS. Despite using EIS and only 60fps, I thought the Magic 7 Pro recorded solid video, even while sledding down a small ski hill.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bl_hfa9r8_c" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Another challenging test involved mounting the Magic 7 Pro to the top of an ATV while riding it through the city of Bled. This would be hard for any smartphone to handle due to the rough terrain and engine vibrations coming from the ATV.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nSfo86Rg9Y4" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>The Magic 7 Pro didn't perform perfectly — it struggled to focus on the landscape versus the mounting clamp partially in the frame. The phone's EIS also couldn't stabilize enough to compensate for the engine vibrations, which is to be expected. Even with these circumstances, I thought this phone performed well, although the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a> is probably still the video king.</p>

<p>If you can look past all the AI noise, the Honor Magic 7 Pro has a camera system capable of hanging with the best of the bunch — even if it can't usurp Vivo flagships just yet. There are some AI and camera features, like AI Motion Sensing Capture and HD Super Burst, that are genuinely great. However, I think too many of them, such as AI Super Zoom and even the over-aggressive night mode, can take away from the Magic 7 Pro's quality camera hardware.</p><p>This phone's calling card is its ability to capture basically any kind of shot with zero motion blur. For those who are getting tired of motion blur — and after spending time with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24 series</a> and iPhone 16 Pro series, I am — the Honor Magic 7 Pro feels like a breath of fresh air.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google made waves when it introduced an AI-powered "Reimagine" tool for Google Photos <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">alongside the Google Pixel 9 series last year</a>. The feature let users create wild and wacky — sometimes misleading — AI-generated versions of their real photos. It blurred the lines between real and fake, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-9-not-the-only-way-to-create-unhinged-ai-photos">which drew public criticism</a>. Months later, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/feed/synthid-reimagine-magic-editor/" target="_blank">announced</a> it would begin watermaking photos that had been digitally altered with AI in Google Photos.</p><p>"Starting this week, Google Photos will begin using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://deepmind.google/technologies/synthid/" target="_blank">SynthID</a> (a technology that embeds an imperceptible, digital watermark directly into AI-generated images, audio, text or video) to mark images edited with generative AI using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelcamera/answer/15209122" target="_blank">Reimagine</a> in Magic Editor," the company explained in a short post. "This helps people identify AI-generated content quickly and easily."</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-imagen-2-vertex-ai-debut">SynthID</a> has appeared in other Google AI products in the past as a way to detect and identify AI-generated content. It works by embedding watermarking information directly into content, which isn't noticeable to the human eye but is easy to identify. It's designed to thwart out AI-generated text, music, images, videos, and more.</p><p>For example, images generated with the company's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-imagen-3-is-now-open-to-everyone-in-the-us">Imagen 3</a> text-to-image generator are already digitally-watermarked with SynthID. Notably, photos partially edited with Reimagine in Magic Editor weren't subject to the same SynthID watermarking techniques until now, making it hard for people to differentiate from real and fake.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1178px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.71%;"><img id="8gFgHHmJAkD6peyw3u6xxF" name="imagen-3.jpg" alt="Imagen 3 announcement at I/O 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8gFgHHmJAkD6peyw3u6xxF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1178" height="668" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, when users are concerned about whether an image has been edited with AI or not, they can use the "About this image" function in Google Lens or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>. After searching the image in Lens for Circle to Search, the features will provide any SynthID watermarking information present, as well as any necessary context. It can also show the image's metadata, which holds other clues as to whether a photo was edited with Reimagine in Google Photos.</p><p>This won't work for every image, however. "In some cases, edits made using Reimagine may be too small for SynthID to label and detect — like if you change the color of a small flower in the background of an image," the company explains.</p><p>Still, SynthID watermarking for images reimagined with Magic Editor should help prevent photos materially changed with AI from being passed off as the real thing. New creations with Reimagine will be digitally watermarked starting this week.</p>

<ul><li>Google shared its Super Bowl commercial plans ahead of the big game this Sunday.</li><li>You can get a sneak peek at the ads that will air during the game on YouTube.</li><li>Google's upcoming Super Bowl ad is an emotional piece that comes 15 years after the company's first-ever ad spot.</li></ul>

<p>Ahead of the Super Bowl this Sunday, Feb. 9, Google shared its slate of advertisements showcasing Pixel phones and Gemini software in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/pixel-ad-dream-job-gemini-live/" target="_blank">blog post</a>. The commercial that will air during the game, titled "Dream Job," debut 15 years after Google's first-ever ad was screened alongside the Super Bowl.</p><p>It's an emotional piece showing how the conversational Gemini Live can help everyday people prep for interviews, and there are already over 100 comments under the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7e6g11BJc0" target="_blank">YouTube video</a> talking about how it made viewers feel. In the company's own words, "Dream Job" follows a father prepping for an interview who "taps into the valuable lessons he’s learned as a parent, transforming his experiences into compelling answers and boosting his confidence."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Google is rolling a separate "Party Blitz" commercial on digital channels and social media. It follows a boyfriend trying to hold his own during the Super Bowl with a comical amount of football knowledge in front of his girlfriend's family and friends. "Even though the boyfriend ends up fumbling at times, it's a relatable story that shows how AI can help you navigate unexpected situations with a little more knowledge," Google writes.</p><p>Both of these ad spots highlight how Gemini Live works on the Google Pixel 9 series. Gemini Live is a conversational voice assistant that leverages AI to communicate with users with natural language, making it more accessible than traditional AI chatbots. After debuting exclusively for Google One AI Premium subscribers last year, it then <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-live-is-available-for-free-on-android-phones">became available for free to all users in October 2024</a>.</p>

<p>There will be quite a few appearances from Google before and during the Super Bowl. You can keep an eye out for a pre-game YouTube commercial to kick things off. As <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/workspace/50-states-50-stories-small-business-ads/" target="_blank">announced in January</a>, Google will also run 50 ads in as many local markets to highlight how small business use Gemini in Workspace in their home market. Finally, the company has creator content and in-game experiences planned for the once-in-a-year event.</p><p>"As people all across the U.S. come together this Sunday, Gemini Live on Pixel can help you learn, plan, create and get things done — even if it’s just mastering football trivia," the company writes.</p>

<p>Verizon's myPlan and myHome plans allow customers to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/verizon-myplan-netflix-max-with-ads-bundle">bundle different perks and services</a> under one bill, and starting today, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One AI Premium</a> is available. Subscribers to the select Verizon mobile or internet plans can add Google One AI Premium for $10 per month, which is about half the usual $19.99 cost of the subscription from Google.</p><p>The company announced the offering in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-google-one-gemini-advanced-ai?cjdata=MXxOfDB8WXww&cjdata=MXxOfDB8WXww&URL=https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-google-one-gemini-advanced-ai&CMP=afc_m_p_cj_na_ot_2022_99&SID=8a3c7539a6d9be21ec3c2f3b1de92b8b&cjevent=308719cfe34211ef83a903990a1eba24&vendorid=CJM&PID=100265324&AID=12154718" target="_blank">press release</a> earlier this week, but users can now add the perk to their myPlan or myHome bundles in the Verizon app or website starting today, Feb. 6. You can only add one Google One AI Premium subscription per plan. While certain features, like 2TB of cloud storage across Gmail and Google Drive, can be shared with up to five others — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-one-gemini-advanced-family-access">all the AI features are limited to the primary user</a>.</p><p>Google One AI Premium unlocks access to Gemini Advanced and other newer models, including the Gemini 2.0 suite.

<p>Verizon introduced the "myPlan" pricing model back in 2023, and it received mixed reactions from subscribers. To some users, the myPlan offering keeps bills lean and without unwanted perks. However, others saw the move as a tactic to push people off grandfathered unlimited cellular plans, which were giving customers more perks for less money than a comparable myPlan.</p><p>Whether a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/verizon-myplan-everything-you-need-to-know">myPlan</a> or myHome plan will be a better deal than your current phone or internet plan will depend on what you need and how much you currently play. Focusing on the Google One AI Premium perk, it's hard to not like the offer. You'll save half if you subscribe through Verizon versus directly from Google.</p><p>It's the first AI-focused add-on to myPlan and myPlan, per the company. "As the first U.S. wireless provider to offer an AI-powered perk at an incredible value, we’re putting the future of AI directly into our customers’ hands, making everyday tasks easier via Google One AI Premium,” said Sowmyanarayan Sampath, who is the CEO of Verizon's consumer business.</p>

<ul><li>Nothing seemingly teases the existence of a physical camera button on the Phone 3a in a recent image on X.</li><li>Apple notably features one on the iPhone 16, which lets users swipe through camera modes and snap photos without touching the display.</li><li>Nothing's recent quarterly report confirmed the March 4 date for the Phone 3a, as well as stating the flagship Phone 3 is on course for 2025.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Nothing is ready to get 2025 off on the right foot with the Phone 3a, but first, there's a teaser about a familiar hardware feature.</p><p>This week, Nothing posted an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/nothing/status/1886358075835105673">official teaser image</a> of the side of the Phone 3a is a glowing white aesthetic (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/03/nothing-phone-3a-camera-button-teaser/">9to5Google</a>). The only tagline by the company reads, "Your second memory, one click away." The majority of speculation in the X thread wonders if Nothing has teased a physical camera button for the Phone 3a.</p><p>This would let users place the phone in landscape or portrait mode and press the side-mounted button instead of tapping the display.</p><p>A camera control button is something Apple features on the iPhone 16 — which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-iphone-16s-camera-control-button-is-actually-cool-i-want-it-on-android-phones">would be nice to have on an Android</a>. In Apple's case, users can control and swap between camera modes by slowly swiping along the button before fully pressing to snap a photo.</p><p>Nothing ends its teaser with its "Power in Perspective" tagline and when the Phone 3a will debut: 4 March at 10:00 GMT.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Your second memory, one click away.Power in Perspective. 4 March 10:00 GMT. pic.twitter.com/FHhAgzSZBz<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1886358075835105673">February 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Nothing has been dropping teasers about its next device for a while and one from late January suggests a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3-or-phone-3a-could-be-coming-on-march-4">launch during MWC 2025</a>. Perhaps this isn't too surprising as the company launched the Phone 2a during MWC 2024. There are also those wondering if Nothing's CMF brand could have something in store alongside the Phone 3a.</p><p>At the end of January, Nothing held its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-series-launch-quarterly-update-confirmed">first quarterly report</a> of 2025, which confirmed the March 4 date for its next product launch. The company also states the upcoming device will be known as the "Nothing Phone 3a Series." Nothing's co-founder, Akis Evangelidis, got candid about the a-series, stating it's designed for people who get "excited about tech" but are also happy with a "great user experience."</p><p>Specification <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-leaked-specifications">rumors</a> about the device suggest it could feature a 6.8-inch AMOLED and a triple-lens array. This setup could involve a 50MP lens, a 50MP telephoto, and an 8MP ultra-wide-angle lens. Moreover, tipsters claim the phone could contain a 5,000mAh battery with 45W fast charging capabilities.</p><p>Considering the a-series is typically a little more budget-conscious, rumors purport that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ai-is-coming-to-more-budget-phones-thanks-to-qualcomms-new-snapdragon-7s-gen-3">Snapdragon 7s Gen 3</a> mid-range chip could power it.</p>

<ul><li>A tipster on Weibo claims the OnePlus 13 "Mini" could change up the company's typical set of cameras.</li><li>The rumor states the phone could feature a dual-camera bar setup with a 50MP primary lens and a 50MP telephoto lens.</li><li>OnePlus 13 "Mini" rumors cropped up in November, stating the device could rock the Snapdragon 8 Elite and a 6.3-inch OLED screen.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>OnePlus is allegedly working on a compact smartphone in the works and the latest rumors might've expanded on that idea.</p><p>Prominent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.weibo.com/6048569942/Pd0ZBwVwe?pagetype=profilefeed">Weibo leaker</a> Digital Chat Station (DCS) posted a series of camera specs and hardware changes (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://playfuldroid.com/oneplus-13-mini-could-be-equipped-with-bar-shaped-dual-camera-setup/">PlayfulDroid</a>). According to DCS, a "small" device could sport a dual-camera setup with a 50MP primary lens and (potentially) a 50MP telephoto lens with 2x zoom.</p><p>Additionally, DCS claims this device could see a departure from OnePlus' recent circular camera array trend, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">13 series</a> or the 12 series. The leak states the phone, which is rumored to be the "OnePlus 13 Mini," could feature a "simple-bar" design for this proposed dual lens setup.</p><p>DCS ends their post purporting the smaller flagship variant could also sport Qualcomm's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> SoC.</p><p>The publication gives credit to this rumor by citing a recent statement by OnePlus industrial designer Lao Haoran about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://playfuldroid.com/2025-oneplus-phones-new-design/">future of product designs</a>. It was stated by Haoran that the OEM's upcoming phones will feature a "renewed design," which could extend further beyond what's been rumored for the "mini" flagship.</p><p>Also, some users on Weibo wondered if the design rumor could make this variant look like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-nord-4-review">OnePlus Nord 4</a>. Launched in August 2024, the Nord 4 features two large camera lenses side by side at the top of the back panel with its LED flash off to the right. This <em>could </em>be a potential design avenue; however, the term "bar" gets us wondering if things could teeter toward a Google Pixel-like bump.</p><p>Speculation aside, rumors of a OnePlus 13 "Mini" <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-tipped-to-drop-a-compact-phone-with-snapdragon-8-elite-under-the-hood">cropped up in November</a>. A tipster claimed the phone would rock the Snapdragon 8 Elite alongside a flat 6.3-inch OLED display. These rumors were attached <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/a-mini-version-of-the-oppo-find-x8-could-be-in-the-works">to other speculations</a> that OPPO was working on a mini version of the Find X8.</p><p>OPPO's version is said to be on tap to debut in "early 2025." Speculation states the OnePlus variant could drop sometime during the "second half" of the year.</p>

Or is it? While I was scouring the web today in search of Android discounts to cover, I discovered that Amazon was quietly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09VLFYWFY"><strong>pairing the top-rated TerraMaster F4-423 (4-bay) server with a $69 coupon</strong></a>, you just need to check the Apply button before you add it to your cart. </p><p>It&apos;s the biggest discount that the 4-bay version of this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-nas-plex">best NAS for Plex</a> has ever received from Amazon, but you could easily miss it if you aren&apos;t being particularly vigilant. The problem is that the coupon expires on February 7th at midnight EST, so act fast if you&apos;re trying to upgrade your storage setup. </p>

<p>As described in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/terramaster-f4-423-review">our detailed 4.5/5-star review</a>, the TerraMaster F4-423 has some of the best hardware in its class, coming complete with a Celeron N5095 quad-core processor, Dual 2.5GbE Ethernet connectivity, and 80TB of total raw capacity. You also get an HDMI port on the back and a built-in M.2 2280 NVMe SSD slot if you need to add more memory.</p><p>Sure, the F4-423 isn&apos;t the absolute best NAS server ever built (and it&apos;s recently been supplanted by the newer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/terramaster-f4-424-max-review">TerrMaster F4-424 Max</a>), but if you&apos;re looking for a slightly more-affordable storage solution, the value here is unmatched. We&apos;re unlikely to see another NAS deal of this caliber until the spring sales kick off, so if you&apos;re ready to drop some cash today, now&apos;s your chance. </p>

This meant the company was no longer competing with rivals on the same playing field. Rather, Nintendo would make the Wii a console for the non-gamer, convincing broader demographics to pick up a console for the first time in history.</p>

<p>It worked.

Existing Quest users upgraded to the Quest 3 and Quest 3S in solid numbers during 2024 but nowhere near the number of users new to the platform.</p><p>All of these numbers add up to a clear demographic shift that's been felt by developers far and wide over the past 6-8 months. While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/mark-rabkin-leaving-meta-quest">VP of VR is leaving</a>, the strategy that's been employed over the past few months is finally being made clearer to developers, and Meta is offering to be more transparent and helpful in 2025, something that's particularly important given the changes in store for the Quest.</p>

<p>Up until the past year or so, VR gamer demographics were largely made up of hardcore VR gamers who found their niche. While this group is wholly dedicated and has been around through the thick and thin of the last decade of VR gaming, it's becoming clear that this group of people is slowly becoming the minority.</p><p>Meta notes that only 20% of people who bought a Quest 3S upgraded from an older Quest headset, while 27% of people who bought a Quest 3 were upgrade customers. That means the lion's share of people who bought either Quest 3 or Quest 3S had never owned a Meta Quest headset before.</p><p>While Meta's blog post notes that VR enthusiasts remain "a foundation of this growing ecosystem," <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/from-quest-to-horizon-how-metas-shifting-priorities-are-affecting-developers/">several developers have seen reduced sales</a> from this group. They "have high expectations for fidelity and gravitate to premium titles that feature high production value," according to Meta, yet titles like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/assassins-creed-nexus-vr-review">Assassin's Creed Nexus</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/metro-awakening-review">Metro Awakening</a> have a much smaller player base than games like DigiGods, Gorilla Tag, and Yeeps: Hide and Seek.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The Meta Quest platform has seen many AAA releases in the last two years, but the games that perform best are often made by small studios with social-first paradigms.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>That's because young people make up an ever-larger share of new users, something that's reflected not just in Meta Horizon store statistics but also across social media. People are calling Quest a "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/motorsep/status/1886788820466597991">kiddie platform</a>" because of the rise of free-to-play (F2P) titles that are often filled with excitable kids. Join any Horizon Worlds world or a game like Gorilla Tag, and you're guaranteed to run across plenty of kids along the way.</p><p>Meta paints this picture as a rosy one, saying F2P titles are a new opportunity for developers to capitalize on. While this may be true, it doesn't bode well for AAA games in an industry recently dominated by lay-offs and budget reductions. In other words, while we've gotten a ton of great AAA games to date, the likelihood is that Quest owners will see fewer AAA games going forward.</p><p>I've spoken to several developers who aren't exactly happy with this trend and are finding themselves on the wrong side of industry change. Matters were made worse when Meta overhauled the Meta Quest mobile app <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://communityforums.atmeta.com/t5/Announcements/Meta-Quest-mobile-app-is-getting-a-new-name-and-look/bc-p/1288594">in July</a>, morphing it into a Meta Horizon app instead. This new app prioritized F2P Horizon Worlds content over premium paid content, and developers felt the shift en masse when big-name games weren't selling as they used to.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rpeYoWSKPccWqz3KwAQHDJ" name="meta-quest-3S-nintendo-switch-steam-deck-ps5-controller-02" alt="A Meta Quest 3S alongside a Steam Deck, Nintendo Switch, and PlayStation 5 controller" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rpeYoWSKPccWqz3KwAQHDJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What we're seeing on the Meta Quest isn't siloed by any means, but the trajectory is somewhat unique. The Final Fantasy VII remake was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/final-fantasy-16-and-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-didnt-meet-expectations-for-square-enix">said to be a commercial failure</a> even after selling over seven million copies. Many AAA game studios have reported the same thing with other big-name games, meaning two big problems are plaguing the AAA market: ballooning budgets and a reduced number of users interested in these types of games.</p><p>That leaves current development studios in a bad spot. Veteran VR developer Fast Travel Games laid off 30 employees <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/vr-dev-fast-travel-games-cuts-30-employees-saying-vr-faces-a-more-uncertain-year-">last week</a>, and several other developers have had similar stories in the past few months. Meta says it's trying to set developers up for success with new initiatives but it might be too little too late for some development studios.</p><p>What's clear is studios that can move quickly and adapt on the fly are the ones that will see the most success going forward. When the Meta Quest app became the Meta Horizon app, it also brought a new open store that more or less abolished curation in favor of a "throw it at the wall and see what sticks" strategy.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>AAA game budgets aren't sustainable on any platform these days, but it's evident that there's little appetite for big-budget games on the Quest platform based on sales.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Developers quickly complained about the inordinate amount of Gorilla Tag clones flooding the store every day, drowning out any actual good content with shovelware. When I interviewed VP of VR Mark Rabkin at Meta Connect in September 2024, he told me that high volumes of content weren't a concern, just something new to navigate around.</p><p>It became clear to me this week why. In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-cto-metaverse-reality-labs-legendary-misadventure-memo-2025-2">leaked memo</a>, Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth told employees that Meta would need to double down on the Metaverse this year, meaning more social apps and Horizon Worlds promotion. This news, coupled with today's blog post from Meta, is a sign that developers need to start focusing more on social apps and less on big-budget single-player experiences if they want to succeed.</p><p>Meta says a suite of new tools will help developers understand who their customers are, how they behave, what they buy, and what experiences they spend time in."</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Meta is leaning more toward social games and Metaverse promotion, meaning developers will have to adapt or likely face difficulties moving forward.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The hardest part in all of this is seeing something you love slowly die. While it's clear the Meta Quest platform is healthier than ever — the trajectory of revenue and user retention gets better every quarter, not worse — the dream of being an Xbox or PlayStation-type system feels further away than ever.</p><p>We've got plenty of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games" target="_blank">amazing Meta Quest games</a>, particularly over the past year, but waning sales for big-name titles in favor of smaller indie studios means the path to profitability moving forward is very clear for development studios.</p><p>My hope is that this means we get more games like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/breachers-is-the-best-multiplayer-quest-game-ive-ever-played">Breachers</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/contractors-showdown-meta-quest-3">Contractors: Showdown</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/you-should-play-more-video-games-with-your-kids">Dungeons of Eternity</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/demeo-x-dungeons-and-dragons-battlemarked-sounds-incredible">Demeo x Dungeons & Dragons</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/walkabout-minigolf-meta-quest-mars-gardens">Walkabout Mini Golf</a> instead of simple Gorilla Tag clones that take little to no effort to design. I love multiplayer games, particularly ones that have unique hooks and encourage long-term progression with in-game perks and upgrades rather than social hangouts with no real goal.</p><p>There's obviously room for both here but I fear the writing is on the wall for big-name games on the platform in the future. Indie is here to stay, and it's likely what's going to power Quest development going forward instead of big publishing houses. That is definitely not a bad thing, given the horribly toxic culture in most big development houses, but it also means fewer opportunities to enjoy more high-production content on the platform.</p>

<hr>
<p>OPPO is continuing to run the teaser engine as it builds interest around its next flagship foldable.</p><p>The company's CEO Pete Lau <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/PeteLau/status/1887403353908416736">went on X</a> today (Feb 6) to tease the upcoming foldable, the Find N5. As OPPO continues to build hype around the phone's build, Lau took a different approach and teased its crease. Foldable enjoyers can't get away from the crease and while the Find N5 still has one, it's not quite as noticeable.</p><p>OPPO's Lau posted two photos of the Find N5 on the left beside the competition, which appears to be Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>.</p><p>With both displays off, the Find N5's crease is a bit more minimal, even from two different angles. However, with a closer look (and a little zoom), you can notice where the display warps slightly. It's less noticeable than the Fold 6 beside it despite Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review#:~:text=Nevertheless%2C%20let%27s%20talk%20about%20that%20crease.">efforts at reducing the crease</a> between it and the Fold 5.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">No crease detected 🔍 Well, not on the #OPPOFindN5 😉 pic.twitter.com/bIwi1vO6sr<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1887403353908416736">February 6, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>The good news about this crease improvement is the OnePlus Open 2 should benefit from this, as well. OnePlus and OPPO tend to work off one another, seeing as the former leans toward global launches a bit more. Interestingly, Lau's Find N5 crease teaser comes shortly after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppos-find-n5-could-be-even-thinner-than-the-magic-v3-and-thats-a-big-deal">rumors of its thinness</a> were posted on X. We've known that OPPO was going to push the thin-factor of the Find N5 after the company's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-really-hope-the-oneplus-open-2-doesnt-make-the-same-mistake-as-the-pixel-9-pro-fold">official image on Weibo</a>, but this new rumor pits against the Honor Magic V3.</p><p>Recent rumors claim the OPPO Find N5 will measure 4.2mm when unfolded. This is down a bit from the 5.8mm thickness of the Find N3.</p><p>There are some concerns about the thinness of the OPPO Find N5, specifically about what sort of sacrifices users will have to deal with.</p><p>While that remains to be seen, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-2-telephoto-upgrade-rumored">another set of rumors</a> suggests the Find N5 could feature macro support for its telephoto lens. Having a camera with macro support would let users take high-quality, detailed shots from a greater distance away due to its telephoto position. Those rumors brought the OnePlus Open 2 into the equation, as well, as it may also see a telephoto macro lens.</p><p>Other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppos-upcoming-find-n5-foldable-tabbed-to-feature-ipx8-and-ipx9-water-resistance">official teasers</a> saw the Find series' product manager, Zhou Yibao, stating the Find N5 will feature "IPX6, IPX8, and IPX9 full-level waterproof performance."</p>

<hr>
<p>Sundar Pichai has announced new updates coming to Gemini 2.0, which includes its broader availability alongside a release on new model dubbed Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite, which promises to be the company’s most cost-efficient model.</p><p>Complementing the stable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-stable-version-of-gemini-2-0-flash-is-rolling-out-now-in-the-gemini-app">Gemini 2.0 Flash rollout</a> to Gemini from last week, the search giant is making it available via the Gemini API in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI — where “Developers can now build production applications with 2.0 Flash,” Google notes in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/gemini-model-updates-february-2025/">announcement blog post</a>.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">2/ We’re introducing a new model Flash-Lite, which is extremely efficient and capable, in public preview.

<p>“2.0 Flash is now generally available to more people across our AI products, alongside improved performance in key benchmarks, with image generation and text-to-speech coming soon.”</p><p>The search giant is also releasing an experimental version of Gemini 2.0 Pro. It's said to have the “strongest coding performance and ability to handle complex prompts.” It also claims to utilize its better understanding and reasoning of world knowledge than the previous Gemini models.</p><p>This model equips the largest context window at 2 million tokens; for instance, the previous Gemini 2.0 Flash experimental model was capable of 1 million tokens that could upload up to 1500 pages of file uploads.</p>
<p>The experimental Gemini 2.0 Pro model with 2 million tokens thus enables "it to comprehensively analyze and understand vast amounts of information, as well as the ability to call tools like Google Search and code execution."</p><p>Developers can take advantage of the experimental Gemini 2.0 Pro through Google AI Studio and Vertex AI. Meanwhile, Gemini Advanced users can also try it through the drop-down menu on their desktop and mobile clients.</p><p>The cost-efficient model dubbed Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite comes as a successor to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-gemini-model-highlights">Gemini 1.5 Flash</a> while sticking to the same speed and cost. The 2.0 Flash-Lite model also claims to outperform the previous iteration quite significantly in most of the benchmarks.</p>
<p>It also incorporates a 1 million context window and multimodal input. The company also cites an example of the 2.0 Flash-Lite wherein "it can generate a relevant one-line caption for around 40,000 unique photos, costing less than a dollar in Google AI Studio’s paid tier. "</p><p>The new 2.0 Flash-Lite model is also available in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI in public preview. And here are the pricing details of all the aforementioned Gemini AI API models.</p>

<ul><li>Google is reportedly informing its employees of an new internal test for an "AI Mode" in Search.</li><li>AI Mode seems to resemble a regular chat with Gemini and breaks down responses for users with complex questions.</li><li>This mode is reportedly leveraging a "custom" Gemini 2.0 model, but there are no details about when this could arrive, though it's speculated for 2025.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A report claims that Google is entering a more serious test regarding a new Search feature in development.</p><p>A post by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/05/google-search-ai-mode-testing/">9to5Google</a> states the publication reportedly saw an "internal email" about the company beginning to test "AI Mode" in Search. This alternate mode in Search is supposedly displayed as a chat, reminiscent of talking with Gemini. It seems that the Gemini-like theme remains consistent in AI Mode as, when delivering a response, Search neatly displays answers to complex questions with defined headers.</p><p>Users can offer feedback, like thumbs up or thumbs down, for the answer, as well as the option to ask "follow-up" questions.</p><p>This early glimpse highlights a right-hand box of additional links. It doesn't look like these are "sources" that AI Mode leveraged, but more like extra links to help you continue searching if you need more info.</p><p>The publication states its information stems from an "internal email" it reportedly viewed. AI Mode is allegedly powered by a "custom" variant of Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-2-0-experimental-advanced-is-googles-best-ai-model-yet-and-its-available-now">Gemini 2.0 model</a>, which could aid in its ability to break down a user's question to provide a clear response.</p><p>Additionally, the company allegedly told employees that AI Mode is designed to help users with "advice and comparisons." It's said that Search will "intelligently research" for users when asked a question. Google also reportedly told employees that the feature could help families determine how much food to make and how to begin a new project.</p><p>The post adds that the information was obtained from a supposed "early release" version of AI Mode. Speculation states the feature could roll out sometime this year; however, changes are possible.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:594px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:101.01%;"><img id="shQH7S7mwR8pL3FJcvWgUN" name="google-search-ai-mode-early-preview-highlight" alt="Google is reportedly testing a new "AI Mode" in Search that will break down complex questions/information to give users clear responses." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/shQH7S7mwR8pL3FJcvWgUN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="594" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google Search has remained relatively quiet recently, as the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-ai-overviews-global-language-support-expansion">expanded its AI Overviews</a> to over 100 countries a few months ago. Users in Asian-Pacific regions, as well as several European/African areas, were finally gaining access to the bite-sized feature. Google also provided additional language support to aid its AI feature in its country expansion. Users who natively speak Hindi, Indonesian, Japanese, Spanish, and Portuguese should have a better experience with AI Overviews.</p><p>Elsewhere, the thought of "AI Mode" in Search utilizing a "custom" form of Gemini 2.0 gets us curious, especially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-latest-ai-model-gemini-2-0-is-here-to-usher-in-the-agentic-era">after its December launch</a>. Google said Gemini 2.0 would help usher in the "argentic era" of AI, which means the models are purposely built to power AI agents. Gemini 2.0 is touted as the company's most ambitious step into AI to help users better understand the world around them.</p><p>It remains to be seen what Google specifically does to this model to aid AI Mode in Search. The company launched the Gemini 2.0 Flash experiment in December, too, which is a lighter version of the model that prioritizes speed and efficiency for users.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want a stylish fitness tracker with great battery life and loads of health and fitness tracking features; your budget is under $200. </p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you want more smartwatch features in a wearable; you don&apos;t use Alexa as a voice assistant. </p><p>Like most of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fitbit">best Fitbits</a> on the market, the Versa 4 comes packed with all of the health and fitness tracking metrics you could ever need, from SpO2 and optical HR monitoring to blood oxygen and active sleep tracking. The wearable also boasts an always-on AMOLED display with GPS/NFC support and over six days of battery life on a single charge. </p><p>The watch isn&apos;t quite as advanced as the similar-looking Fitbit Sense 2 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-sense-2-vs-versa-4">when you directly compare the two</a>, but you&apos;re also paying considerably less for most of the same features. Both watches also come with the six free months of Fitbit Premium, a fitness-based subscription service that typically costs $80 per year. </p><p>Unfortunately, the Versa 4 exclusively uses Alexa as a voice assistant, so Google Assistant users may wish to look for another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness smartwatch</a>. You also won&apos;t be able to download third-party apps. All things considered, however, these concessions are a small price to pay if you&apos;re simply looking to upgrade your workout regimen with a versatile smartwatch, and with this 25% discount in tow, the Fitbit Versa 4 is looking like a pretty great deal.</p>

There are literally hundreds of choices in this category, and regardless of whatever model you choose, you get a few things as standard: fast read/writes, reliable designs, and easy connectivity.</p>

<p>I've been using SK Hynix's Beetle X31 in recent weeks, and it is an intriguing option. The drive has a unique design with flowing sides, and I prefer it to the boxy designs that Samsung usually goes with. While the drive has been around for just over a year, the 2TB model is new, and that's the one I'm testing. It <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SK-hynix-Portable-External-Compatible/dp/B0DMS7BZZ7">costs $169 on Amazon</a> — $10 less than the equivalent Samsung option — and if you don't want that much storage, SK Hynix also sells a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SK-hynix-Portable-External-Compatible/dp/B0C4KNB2YK">1TB model that's $89</a>, and a 512GB edition <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SK-hynix-Windowsbased-Androidbased-Smartphones/dp/B0C4KQ6ZWL">at just $49</a>.</p><p>The X31 is available in gold and grey color variants, and I'm using the latter. If you are interested in getting the drive, I'd suggest getting the gold model — it looks just that little bit more elegant.</p>
<p>The sleek design makes it inherently pocketable, and I didn't have any issues taking it on the road. The chassis itself is made out of aluminum, and it has a silky coat similar to that of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-nord-4-review">Nord 4</a>. You get rubber feet at the bottom that ensure it doesn't move around on a desk, and SK Hynix even bundles a silicone case that provides additional durability.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="iur6BUFohfr9dGAYJegDbV" name="SK Hynix Beetle X31" alt="SK Hynix Beetle X31 external SSD in-hand view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iur6BUFohfr9dGAYJegDbV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Even without the case, the X31 holds up incredibly well in daily wear and tear. But given that the case allows the drive to withstand two-meter tumbles and an additional barrier against dust and water ingress — it doesn't have ingress protection — I'd recommend using it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="cZh2sauyMwFVhEbG29owXV" name="SK Hynix Beetle X31" alt="SK Hynix Beetle X31 external SSD with USB-C connector showing next to Magic 7 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cZh2sauyMwFVhEbG29owXV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There isn't much else to talk about the design. The USB-C port is located on the right, and there's a tiny status LED next to it that lights up when the drive is in use. SK Hynix provides USB-C to USB-C and USB-C to USB-A cables with the package, so you can easily connect the X31 to just about any device without needing additional cables.</p>

<p>Nothing I've said so far is different to what you get with most portable SSDs, but it's worth noting that the Beetle X31 doesn't miss out on the basics. Now, where the drive truly shines is data transfers; it has a custom M.2 2242 SSD — a variant of the BC711 — inside the enclosure, and it features an AsMedia ASM2362 controller. What's interesting is that it has an embedded DRAM, which usually isn't the case with these drives.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="29Ao7FdsJJNwXiw6D3WocV" name="SK Hynix Beetle X31" alt="SK Hynix Beetle X31 external SSD connected to Magic 7 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/29Ao7FdsJJNwXiw6D3WocV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The result is that the X31 is able to hit sequential writes of 965MB/s and reads going up to 1,006MB/s, and it sustains those speeds a lot longer than other external SSDs I tried out recently. That alone makes it worthy of recommendation, and with a 2TB model now available, this is the best time to pick up the X31.</p>

<p>I didn't have any issues using the X31 with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Honor Magic 7 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>, and my custom Windows machine. The drive does a great job with extended transfers, and it doesn't lose connectivity. It tends to get a little warm with heavy use, but that's the case with all external drives.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Pz3Y6KdubTW7EWUKEAVv6W" name="SK Hynix Beetle X31" alt="SK Hynix Beetle X31 external SSD with bundled cables and case next to Magic 7 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Pz3Y6KdubTW7EWUKEAVv6W.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Overall, I think SK Hynix is onto a winner with the Beetle X31. The diminutive design combined with fast internal SSD and integrated DRAM makes it a great choice if you need an external drive to store photos, videos, and documents, and you can now get it in a 2TB model.</p>

It's not too surprising, given how closely Google and Samsung have worked together in recent years, to the point where Samsung's phones will sometimes get Google's new AI features before Pixels do.</p><p>But is AI enough to justify upgrading to the Galaxy S25 Plus — especially if you own any of the last two Plus models? And is the Galaxy S25 series really good enough to be considered "Samsung's Pixel"?</p><p>Off the bat, the middle child of Samsung's latest flagship series is a fantastic phone with excellent performance and a great user experience, and it may potentially be a better bet if you're looking at buying the Pixel 9 Pro XL.</p><p>That said, it also represents how Samsung may be losing its touch and willingness to rock the boat in any meaningful way.</p>

<p>The Galaxy S25 Plus was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-launch">launched</a> alongside the base Galaxy S25 and Galaxy S25 Ultra on January 22, 2025, during an Unpacked event in San Jose, California. The phone was available to preorder that same day and goes on sale starting February 7.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 Plus is available at major retailers such as Amazon and Best Buy, as well as various carriers. The phone retails for $999 for the lowest configuration, which includes 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. The price goes up to $1119 for the 512GB variant.</p><p>The main <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/which-samsung-galaxy-s25-color-should-you-buy">Galaxy S25 Plus colors</a> include Navy, Icy Blue, Mint, and Silver Shadow.

<p>It's easy to look at the Galaxy S25 Plus and mistake it for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review">Galaxy S24 Plus</a>... or even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-plus-review">Galaxy S23 Plus</a>. Samsung basically copy-pasted its design over the last several models, making very subtle tweaks with each subsequent release.</p><p>With the Galaxy S25 Plus, Samsung is going completely flat: a flat display, a flat rear glass panel, and a flat frame with rounded corners. It's all very uniform and boring. Compare this to something like the OnePlus 13, and you'll see a very stark difference in design, from the curved glass to the large protruding camera housing and even the rear glass design. The Galaxy S25 Plus would easily be overlooked in a lineup of Android phones.</p><p>The only redeeming quality of the Galaxy S25 Plus design is the new Navy colorway. I've gushed over this ever since it was launched, but it truly is Samsung's best color option since the green <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s22-review">Galaxy S22</a>. It moves away from the pastels Samsung has been using as of late, and I couldn't be happier to finally get a deeper hue. I'm especially happy that it's blue since that's my favorite color.</p><p>And it's not just me who likes it; friends who have seen me using the phone have also commented on its color. That said, there is a Coralread colorway that's exclusive to Samsung.com, which is really nice, too. Otherwise, the remaining Galaxy S25 Plus colors are rather forgettable.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jZPvFWFdsHSySsgtQVVvsX" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-review-04" alt="Galaxy S25 Plus revealing scratches on the back with the Oura Ring 4 top" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jZPvFWFdsHSySsgtQVVvsX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Armor Aluminum frame is sandwiched between two <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/corning-gorilla-glass-victus-2">Gorilla Glass Victus 2</a> panels, so the phone is sufficiently durable. However, if you own a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Galaxy Ring</a> or even an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-review">Oura Ring</a> like I do, you may want to be careful with how you hold the phone. Within days of using the Galaxy S25 Plus, I noticed some scratches on the back finish, which is an unfortunate reminder to buy a case or maybe <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/the-galaxy-s25-is-boring-but-a-dbrand-skin-fixes-that">invest in a Dbrand skin</a> if you wanna add more flair.</p><p>Another reason you'll want a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-cases">Galaxy S25 Plus case</a> (and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-screen-protectors">screen protector</a> while you're at it) is that the sharp corners will do a number on your fingers, especially your pinky, if you hold phones as I do with one hand. For me, it's the only downside to the flatter design.</p>

<p>The display hasn't changed much from the Galaxy S24 Plus. It's slightly larger at 6.7 inches and plenty bright outdoors with very minimal bezels, but the resolution and refresh rate remain at QHD+ and 120Hz. Unfortunately, the phone inexplicably comes out of the box at FHD+, so you'll have to change it in the settings when you set it up, just one of Samsung's many confounding decisions with the phone. Otherwise, it's a great display, and I don't really have any complaints about the quality.</p><p>I will say that I wish Samsung would play around with higher refresh rates, especially for those who like to game on their phones. I like that my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus 2024</a>, for example, comes with a 165Hz OLED panel. Is it overkill? Perhaps, especially for everyday tasks. But Samsung knows how to make great displays, and if you're gonna have a powerful phone like this, the company has the opportunity to give some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-phone-gamers">gaming phones</a> a run for their money. But I digress.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The display on the Galaxy S25 Plus is great, but I wish Samsung would play around with higher refresh rates.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The Galaxy S25 Plus features <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-waterproof">IP68 water and dust resistance</a>, so it's well protected against the elements.

<p>The Galaxy S25 Plus is powered by the latest and greatest chip that Qualcomm has to offer. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-soc-for-galaxy-s25-series">Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a> is a custom-made, souped-up version of the already powerful and AI-ready <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>, and it does a lot of wonders for the Galaxy S25 Plus. Paired with 12GB of RAM, the phone does not show any signs of stuttering or slowing down, which is pretty much expected at this point.</p><p>What surprised me was when playing games like Honkai: Star Rail at max settings, the phone stayed quite cool. I noticed it gets <em>slightly</em> warm throughout my gameplay, but overall, the phone is cooler than most when playing this game, even in high or medium settings.</p>
<p>That said, the chipset is one of the few things about this phone that is new, with the overall specs closely matching the Galaxy S24 Plus.</p>

<p>I can't express this enough, but I love One UI 7. As a fan of One UI throughout the years, I admit the software wasn't perfect, and there were some things I did not like. With One UI 7, which debuts on the Galaxy S25 series, Samsung has addressed a lot of my biggest problems with the software.</p><p>The new vertical scrolling app drawer is arguably the best new addition. Oddly, it isn't enabled by default, and turning it on is a little confusing (change the setting to "Alphabetical" sorting), but once it's enabled, it's perfect. But even beyond that, I've had a positive experience with the changes to One UI 7, including the newly separated (and admittedly iPhone-esque) Quick Panel and notification settings.</p><p>Samsung adopted a much more bubbly icon style for many of its UI elements, including widgets. It reminds me of the Pixel UI, which I'm not a fan of, but I still prefer how Samsung utilizes space, retaining the smaller customizable quick toggles while implementing a new expandable panel, and stacking notifications over each other for the same app.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zxZnzRSrhukKHFsJSmHh76" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-notification-shade" alt="Galaxy S25 Plus notification shade" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zxZnzRSrhukKHFsJSmHh76.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Overall, One UI 7 feels incredible to use. Swiping, scrolling, expanding, and closing through the software feels extremely buttery, almost like nothing I've ever experienced before on a phone. Just about every aspect of it feels incredibly optimized.</p><p>Samsung says the Galaxy S25 Plus will receive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-many-software-updates-will-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-get">seven years of OS and security updates</a>, which is becoming a new standard for the company's flagship phones. It'll be interesting to see just how well the software and chip hold out that far into the future, but the Snapdragon 8 Elite feels like it won't slow down any time soon.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>One UI 7 feels just as fast and fluid as ever, and Samsung will keep the Galaxy S25 Plus updated for seven years.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Unfortunately, Samsung is still doing some questionable things with how it handles its default out-of-the-box behaviors and settings. I already commented on the display betting set to FHD+ instead of QHD+, but I found myself having to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/this-one-change-almost-ruined-the-galaxy-s25-ultra-for-me">change the lock screen notifications</a> to the Cards style so I could actually <em>see</em> that I got notifications when the phone was locked, otherwise they go largely unnoticed. I also had to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/enable-notification-categories-samsung-galaxy-s24">enable Notification Categories</a> for better customization, an issue we had with One UI 6 that I thought would be addressed with One UI 7.</p><p>I also hate that Samsung defaults to waking the AI assistant when pressing and holding the power button. I just want my power button to be a power button. That said, I can see why Samsung would do this, and it all has to do with Samsung and Google's big bet on AI.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GSE67exCYcvrPz3FdhbdGM" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-review-20" alt="Gemini on the Galaxy S25 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GSE67exCYcvrPz3FdhbdGM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>By default, the power button activates <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a>, which not only got a new look but also got some useful upgrades. Much of the focus has been on Gemini's ability to work across different apps to get tasks done without much input from the user. In my experience, this worked fairly well, but results can be hit or miss depending on the complexity of what you're asking. And while Gemini can now be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-allows-users-to-share-images-files-youtube-videos-to-gemini-live">used across Samsung apps</a>, its ability is still somewhat limited for now.</p><p>Still, it works fairly well for what you'll likely need or use it for. For instance, I asked Gemini about a YouTube video explaining the recent controversy over raw milk, then told it to make a list of the main takeaways. It saved a list to Google Keep with a title and bullet points, and it was fairly spot on, getting the bigger points while skipping over some of the minute details.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VbUWoQUeuBD9FzKph57tHM" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-review-14" alt="Prompting Gemini to create a note of a YouTube video on the Galaxy S25 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VbUWoQUeuBD9FzKph57tHM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>

<p>Gemini was also able to accurately read the details of my flight itinerary from my screen, then create a calendar event for me, create a list with the details, and text said details to my friend. That said, there are times when Gemini will run into walls because it can't access certain apps, services, or data, and sometimes it will either skip a step or just say that it can't complete the task for whatever reason.</p><p>At one point, I forgot to specify which video I was referring to and ended up getting Rickrolled by Gemini, which gave me a chuckle.</p><p>Yet, despite the shortcomings, it's impressive to see just how far Gemini's capabilities have come. It's even more interesting to see how Samsung is essentially making this the highlight of its AI push on the Galaxy S25. Bixby is still around, but it's put on the back burner and goes largely ignored... unless you absolutely want to use it.</p>

<p>Samsung's other features are actually quite fun to use, and some have received nice upgrades. Drawing Assist feels very much like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-pixel-studio">Pixel Studio</a>, providing a very stylistic hub where you can create images by drawing, using photos as a reference, or using text descriptions. You can also combine images or drawings with text to help you refine what you want the final result to be. The results are pretty good, although Samsung doesn't afford as much freedom to generate certain things or characters as Google or Motorola (it ignored my attempts to generate R2-D2 or Sora from Kingdom Hearts).</p><p>Another Pixel-like feature is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-use-audio-eraser-on-the-samsung-galaxy-s25">Audio Eraser</a>, which does just as it says. You can take just about any video on your phone and adjust the levels of various audio sources, such as voices, music, and other noise. It works surprisingly well and will even identify a crowd over a main speaker so you can hear your subject better. I also like that you can edit videos you didn't capture with the Galaxy S25.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="V4cgUPaWVooKBfWLvALCN5" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-Audio-Eraser" alt="Galaxy S25 Plus Audio Eraser" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V4cgUPaWVooKBfWLvALCN5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>And while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> is very much present, AI Select acts as a cool alternative to extract images or text from your screen to accomplish various contextual tasks on the device. Circle a date or any text, and it'll give you the option to add an event or open Writing Assist. Circle an image, and it'll present you with options for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-galaxy-ai-generative-edit">Generative Edit</a>, setting it as a wallpaper, or creating a GIF.</p><p>Oh, and Writing Assist features are thankfully no longer tied to Samsung's awful keyboard and are accessible either with AI Select or by highlighting text and tapping the sparkle icon. Unfortunately, the incredibly useful Interpreter feature is still tied to Samsung Keyboard if you want to translate your texts when chatting in other languages.</p>

<p>Mimicry is a form of flattery, and many of the features make the Galaxy S25 Plus feel like a Pixel in all the best ways. Although one new feature takes a cue from the iPhone, and another feature is surprisingly not already on a Pixel, even though it feels like it should be. I'm talking about the Now Bar and Bow Brief, respectively.</p><p>Now Bar is a Dynamic Island of sorts that sits at the bottom of the lock screen and presents contextual information, such as Google Maps directions, music controls, sports, and more. Because it sits at the bottom of the display, it's very easy to reach to control your music or expand the bar to get a better look at live scores.</p><p>At the moment, it feels a bit limited, which may be due to a seeming lack of third-party support.

<p>Now Brief gives you a snapshot of your day by presenting you with upcoming events, weather forecasts, news alerts, and more. If you use Samsung Health, you may find your Energy Score or activity ring here, although this has been pretty hit or miss for me. Now Brief updates at different times of the day to keep you updated in the morning, midday, afternoon, evening, and so on. You may also find photos you've taken earlier that day when you're about to wind down.</p><p>This is another feature that doesn't feel as useful as it should be, but I do like where Samsung is going with it. My briefings are often devoid of anything aside from weather and calendar events, and my health data doesn't appear nearly as often as I would like. The experience just doesn't feel very consistent, which is something I hope will change over time with more use.</p>

<p>The camera hardware on the Galaxy S25 Plus is largely unchanged from its predecessor. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but it's not really a great thing, either. The 50MP primary camera produces very respectable images that feel crisp and vibrant, even in the dull grey of Seattle. The images don't exactly blow me away, but they're still good enough that I doubt many people would complain.</p><p>That goes for the ultrawide and telephoto cameras, too. Both are quite good and able to keep up with the main sensor without deviating too far in terms of color reproduction and contrast. That said, I do find that images from the Galaxy S25 Plus tend to feature more contrast than I would like, and low-light images can often appear surprisingly dark, even with Night Mode turned on.</p>

<p>I also find that the bokeh just doesn't feel as natural as it does with the OnePlus 12, which is able to nicely keep the lantern and the branch it's hanging on in focus while everything else is sufficiently blurred. The Galaxy S25 Plus does a decent job, but the effect just isn't as dramatic, even though it manages to at least pull in more color.</p>
<iframe allow="" height="470" width="100%" data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=fc71c6d8-e421-11ef-9397-d93975fe8866"></iframe>
<p>The vibrant images taken with the Galaxy S25 Plus tend to feel much livelier than those from my Pixel 9, although the latter does a better job with low-light and nighttime images, pulling in more light while retaining plenty of detail. Samsung tends to stick to applying as much contrast as possible, so the colors on the Fuego sign are quite punchy, while the Pixel feels a bit washed out.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, you won't find the same fun camera features on the Galaxy S25 Plus as you would on the Pixel. Something akin to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-add-me-google-pixel-9">Add Me</a> would be a fun addition to the phone, and there's also no Macro mode, which feels like a missed opportunity.</p><p>There is, however, 8K video recording at 30fps. Do we need it? No, but it's another one of those nice-to-have features. The new Galaxy Log is another one, which lets the phone shoot Log video with a flatter color profile and more dynamic range, giving users more flexibility when editing afterward. Unfortunately, editing on the device itself is pretty limited to just applying Samsung's color correction, but you can always bring the footage over to programs like Premiere Pro and edit there to add your own color corrections and color grading.</p><p>Again, it's not for everyone, but it's nice to have for the people who want it.</p>

<p>Despite having a more powerful chip and the same battery capacity as last year's model, the Galaxy S25 Plus is pretty solid when it comes to battery life. The phone gets me through the day without issue, even between playing games like Pokémon Go and scrolling through Instagram Reels. I manage to average roughly seven or eight hours of screen-on time in my use, which is pretty nice.</p><p>Charging hasn't been as generous. The phone supports 45W charging speeds, which is a pretty decent figure when compared to 25W on the base Galaxy S25, but I the phone still slows to a crawl when I'm actually charging it. Granted, I don't have a Samsung charger, but it takes well over an hour for my 100W Anker charger to charge the Galaxy S25 Plus form 1% to full, despite the phone telling me it would only take roughly an hour to fill up.</p>

<p>As for wireless charging, the Galaxy S25 Plus supports 15W speeds and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-support-qi2-wireless-charging">officially supports Qi2</a> despite not having built-in magnets. This is important because it means you can use those Qi2/MagSafe chargers your iPhone friends have to top up the phone at full speed, granted you have a magnetic case for the phone.</p><p>In my experience, this has worked just fine, and it really makes me appreciate the convenience of MagSafe charging, even if speeds aren't terribly fast. The only downside for some is that a case is necessary to make this work, but we'll always recommend having a case than not.</p>

<p>The Galaxy S25 is one of the first phones to launch in 2025, but it already has quite a number of phones to contend with if you're looking for a new device to upgrade to.</p><p>The most obvious is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>, which features a slightly larger 6.8-inch QHD+ display. Like the Galaxy S25 Plus, the Pixel sports a 50MP triple camera setup, great battery life, and 45W charging. There's also plenty of AI on the Pixel, and Google will often release new features there before they reach other phones. The Pixel has more RAM to help with AI processing, although the Snapdragon 8 Elite on the Galaxy S25 Plus will beat out the Pixel's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> in terms of raw power and performance. Both phones cost $999.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> is also a worthy contender, sporting a larger curved display and a very unique design. The software may not be as robust with AI, and you get fewer software updates, but the camera is one of the best you'll find on an Android phone, charging speeds are much faster, and the OnePlus 13 costs $100 less than the Galaxy S25 Plus.</p><p>Still, Samsung has a closer relationship with Google, so many new features will reach the Galaxy before they come to OnePlus, and hardware support for Samsung is a bit more robust, especially in the States, where Samsung dominates. And despite being cheaper, the OnePlus is only available unlocked, whereas the Galaxy S25 Plus can be purchased through carriers if you don't want to pay outright.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want a powerful smartphone with extensive software support.</li><li>You want the latest AI features but don't want a Pixel smartphone.</li><li>You're a fan of One UI and/or the Galaxy ecosystem.</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You own a Galaxy S24 Plus or maybe even a Galaxy S23 Plus.</li><li>You want the best Android camera experience.</li><li>You want super-fast charging speeds.</li></ul>
<p>The Galaxy S25 Plus feels like a Pixel phone in all the best ways. Not only is it chock-full of AI, but the software finally feels fluid and cohesive. The AI doesn't overwhelm the experience nor try to get in the way, mostly sitting there waiting for you to interact with it. In a time when AI is everywhere, this is something people may appreciate about Samsung's latest flagships.</p><p>There's a lot to like about the Galaxy S25 Plus, from the large, sharp display to the incredible performance and the efficient use of power. As the middle child of the Galaxy S25 series, the Plus no longer feels like the "awkward" one.</p><p>That said, there's something to be said about the lack of hardware upgrades. Aside from the new Snapdragon chipset, the phone features the same amount of RAM, the same cameras, the same battery capacity and charging specs speeds, and a lot more of the same. Sure, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ask-jerry-qi2-and-the-galaxy-s25">Qi2 is here</a>, but even that is somewhat half-assed.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 Plus just isn't that exciting of a phone, which is exemplified by its rather dull design. It's nice that Samsung kept the price the same, but it would also be nice if AI and a new chip were the only upgrades.</p><p>It sort of echoes much of what I've been hearing about the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/gpu/nvidia-releases-stats-that-prove-dlss-and-frame-generation-are-here-to-stay-sorry-angry-gamers">NVIDIA RTX 50-series GPUs</a>, which also feature seemingly significant performance upgrades while focusing heavily on AI enhancements to improve gameplay. If you have the previous model, and perhaps even the model before that, no matter how good it is, the newest thing just doesn't feel that exciting.</p>

<p>Samsung surprised many when it revealed that it would not be increasing the price of its flagship smartphone. It's available with three different storage configurations, with the 256GB model starting at $1,299. Plus, you won't have to fork up more dough for more RAM, as we have 12GB of memory across the board.</p>
<p>If you opt for picking one of these up from your local carrier or big box store, you'll have four colors to choose from: Titanium Black, Gray, Silverblue, or Whitesilver. However, there are three more colors that are only available through Samsung's online storefront: Titanium Jadegreen, Jetblack, and Pinkgold.</p>

<p>Now that I've had a few weeks with the Galaxy S25 Ultra under my belt, my initial impressions still stand. I appreciate Samsung changing the design to bring it in line with the other phones in its flagship lineup. Now when you look across all of Samsung's latest phones, its flat edges as far as the eye can see, and that level of uniformity is welcome.</p><p>There is one kink in the armor, so to speak, that I've come to realize, however. And it's the same problem that Apple faces, as there's just nothing really special about Samsung phones anymore. I'm sure at some point I wrote that the curved edges need to be banished to the shadow realm, but I don't think that was the right take.</p><p>Don't get me wrong, the Galaxy S25 Ultra feels great to hold and use, but it's just too darn slippery. I actually think I would've preferred for Samsung to take the Apple approach from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/iphone-14-pro-max-review">iPhone 14 Pro Max</a> with the polished frame. At least this would give me some type of grip without feeling the need to bury the phone in a case for the rest of its life.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="TT6LzFAab259voGJGuTJTK" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review-18" alt="Angled view of Galaxy S25 Ultra, Z Fold 5, S24 Ultra, and S24 FE" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TT6LzFAab259voGJGuTJTK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's the same problem that I've had with both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15 Pro Max</a> and now 16 Pro Max. The matte finish on the frame just doesn't lend itself well to being used case-less. Even if you opt for Samsung Care+, which claims "unlimited repairs," that's just another potential headache waiting to happen.</p><p>Unfortunately, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-and-the-wpc-have-officially-made-qi2-on-android-confusing">magnetic alignment protocol of Qi2 charging</a> isn't built into the phone itself. This means that I can't just say "I'm good," and use a MagSafe PopSocket to keep my phone in my hand. So instead, you're left relying on either Samsung's own magnetic case, or one of the third-party case options out there.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yWWfZpcMJ4FtKCt4VctQ87" name="magsafe-ring-adapter-silicone-case-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra" alt="Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra Silicone Case with MagSafe ring and PopSocket" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yWWfZpcMJ4FtKCt4VctQ87.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A recurring theme that I've felt throughout my time with the Galaxy S25 Ultra is that I want a phone that's worthy of the "Ultra" title. There are just a few too many papercuts that keep that from becoming a reality, and it's already started to wear down my excitement.</p><p>The redesigned chassis, allowed Samsung to make the display 0.1-inches larger than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>. So we have a 6.9-inch slab of AMOLED glass staring us in the face all day and night.</p><p>It's a chance for Samsung to flex its muscles and show that it makes the best displays in the world, and for someone like me, I'd have to agree. The screen looks absolutely stunning, and surprisingly, I didn't immediately switch the color profile to the "natural" tone, as I've rather enjoyed the pop and punch offered by the S25 Ultra's display.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="WoDUXsxHeSJBnKw7QB3JdK" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review-13" alt="PWM settings on Miyoo Mini Plus and display settings on Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WoDUXsxHeSJBnKw7QB3JdK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>However, there's an asterisk attached to this and virtually any device that uses a Samsung OLED panel; if you suffer from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)</a>, stay away. While the likes of Honor and OnePlus are implementing features to help combat PWM, Samsung has done nothing of the sort.</p><p>I don't currently have the specific display measurements, but I do know that it won't take long to affect those who suffer from PWM. During our almost two-hour-long hands-on session, my colleague Nick Sutrich remarked that he wouldn't have been able to look at the screens for much longer, as that relatively short amount of time managed to take a toll.</p><p>Perhaps I wouldn't feel as strongly as I do if I didn't happen to work with someone who has to worry about PWM on phones. But I'm actually thankful for Nick, because, without him, I wouldn't have any idea that PWM is a "thing," let alone being taught about how it affects people.</p><p>It would be one thing if Samsung would peel back the veil a bit, providing an actual reason as to why it's not working to remedy these issues. That's not the case, and instead, the most popular Android phone maker in the world continues to cut out a portion of its potential client base for reasons we can't explain.</p>

<p>When life gives you lemons, you let Samsung partner up and slap a "for Galaxy" on the brand sticker. Well, that's what the situation used to be like, as there have been versions of Qualcomm's latest chips specifically made available for Samsung flagships over the past few years.</p><p>However, that's not exactly the case with the Galaxy S25 Ultra, as Samsung explained that it worked with Qualcomm to develop a custom version of the Snapdragon 8 Elite. As you probably could have guessed, much of the reasoning can be attributed to improving the on-device AI capabilities. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-soc-for-galaxy-s25-series">Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a> aims to remove the reliance on the cloud for AI processing while offering some sort of peace of mind that your AI creations aren't directly being used to train Bixby or Gemini.</p><p>So what does the "most powerful" Android phone to date feel like in day-to-day usage? Just like every other flagship Galaxy phone. That's not a tongue-in-cheek comment, nor is it meant to be taken as a negative.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="g8dEbJo2kZAwm667Xb7hUK" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review-10" alt="Folder of emulation apps on Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/g8dEbJo2kZAwm667Xb7hUK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For 99% of people who decide to upgrade to the Galaxy S25 Ultra, it will feel exactly the same as the Galaxy S24 Ultra. And if you're upgrading from an older Galaxy Ultra, or a flagship from another brand, the S25 Ultra will feel like you just finished doing a clean install of Windows on a brand-new SSD.</p><p>Outside of emulation, I have yet to experience any hiccups, slowdowns, or anything of the sort with the Galaxy S25 Ultra. However, when I performed our gauntlet of benchmarks, I did notice a few oddities.</p>

<p>Of the five phones that are included in the chart above, all of which are powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite, the Galaxy S25 Ultra only came in first in <em>one</em> test. Just one. In every other benchmarking test, Samsung's latest and greatest is easily outperformed by one, or most, of the competition.</p><p>It's unlikely that you would notice much of a difference between the S25 Ultra and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-redmagic-10-pro-is-basically-a-power-bank-attached-to-a-gaming-phone">RedMagic 10 Pro</a>, but I can't help but wonder why the results played out this way. Perhaps there's some type of artificial bottleneck that Samsung and/or Qualcomm have implemented. Unfortunately, I don't have an answer, but I will be interested to see whether these numbers begin to shift once software updates are rolling out on a regular basis.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Yhwiku2niAUgLF9MfP7xRX" name="pluvia-on-galaxy-s25-ultra" alt="Pluvia on Galaxy S25 Ultra with Lenovo Legion Go S, ROG Ally X, and AYN Odin 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Yhwiku2niAUgLF9MfP7xRX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Whenever I get my hands on a new device, one of the first things I do is load it up with all of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-emulators-android">best emulators</a>. Doing so gives me a pretty good idea of what performance could be like, especially since I love trying to see what devices are capable of running my favorite Switch games.</p><p>With all of the performance gains that have been described to us about the Snapdragon 8 Elite, and the 8 Elite for Galaxy, I couldn't wait to see what the S25 Ultra could do. However, this is where I hit a brick wall, one that I can't work my way around.</p><p>Between the Snapdragon 8 Elite being such a new chip, and Nintendo's never-ending warpath against Switch emulators, development has pretty much slowed to a crawl. Following the demise of both <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/nintendo-stikes-major-blow-android-emulators">Yuzu and Ryujinx</a> in 2024, there have been a few forks that are still kicking around, but none of them have been optimized for Qualcomm's latest chip.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="wtcutpPMHGgHEnQY6LibWK" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review-14" alt="AdrenoTools Drivers GitHub page on Galaxy S25 Ultra between AYANEO Pocket Micro and Pocket DMG" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wtcutpPMHGgHEnQY6LibWK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Adding another layer of frustration is the lack of driver support, as some emulators allow you to install and use custom GPU drivers. The reason that this is important, from what I've been told, is that Qualcomm's native Adreno drivers just aren't very good. And with the 8 Elite being so new, driver development simply hasn't picked up much steam for the latest devices.</p><p>So while upgrading from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-2-vs-8-plus-gen-1-vs-8-gen-1">Snapdragon 8 Gen 2</a> and its Adreno 740 GPU to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-3-vs-8-gen-2-vs-a17-pro-benchmarks">8 Gen 3</a> with the Adreno 750 wasn't a massive leap, that's not the case with the Snapdragon 8 Elite. Qualcomm's 2025 flagship chip introduces the Adreno 830 GPU, which makes use of a "newly sliced architecture."</p><p>This is how Qualcomm claims the 8 Elite is able to provide a 40% boost in performance and efficiency. Unfortunately, a new architecture means that third-party driver development has to basically start from scratch.</p><p>That was a long-winded way of saying: good luck trying to get anywhere with higher-end emulation for the foreseeable future.

<p>One rather surprising area of improvement has come in the form of battery life. No, Samsung isn't using a bigger battery, and we're still <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-note-10-review-4-months-later">stuck in 2019</a> with 45W wired charging speeds. But over the past few weeks, I've come to realize that I don't have any anxiety about the Galaxy S25 Ultra running out of juice before I'm ready to go to bed.</p><p>Mind you, I don't keep the most regular hours, waking up between 7 AM and 9 AM, and not going to bed until after 2 AM. Not once did I find myself needing to pop the phone on the charger just to give me a few extra minutes of doom-scrolling social media.</p><p>This is what I would expect from a flagship phone, especially one that's touted as being 40% more power efficient than its predecessor. However, that's the same song and dance that we've been sold by many Android phone makers in recent years, so it's kind of turned into an "OEM who cried wolf" situation.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>I don't have any battery anxiety with the Galaxy S25 Ultra, but charging speeds turn this 2025 flagship into one from 2019. </p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The "best" battery day I've had resulted in the S25 Ultra lasting from around 6 AM until it gave up the ghost around 8 AM the next morning. According to the <em>Battery activity</em> page, I had about six hours of screen on time, which was comprised of some YouTube, Pokemon TCGP, Discord, social media scrolling, and a few other random apps.</p><p>Even on the day that I finish off this review, the S25 Ultra manages to hold up like a champ. My day started around 9:30 AM when my wife kicked me out of bed. After getting ready for the day and checking in with my compadres, I needed to go take some more camera samples.</p><p>While making stops at a few different places, the entire time I was taking pictures, the S25 Ultra was unlocked with the Camera app open. Not once did I even feel the phone get warm, but that's probably thanks to the 30-degree weather and not so much the phone needing to work overtime to keep things cool.</p><p>Here I sit, at a little past 11:30 PM, and the S25 Ultra is at 26%. I also know that even if I don't go to bed until 2 or 3 AM, I won't need to plug it in until then. Which is just a peace of mind that I quite enjoy.</p>

<p>All of that being said, I think it's an absolute disappointment that no improvements were made to the charging speeds on the Galaxy S25 Ultra. Sure, if you use Samsung's special case, you "unlock" the ability to use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-support-qi2-wireless-charging">Qi2.1 protocol</a>, but there's no actual benefit to that besides adding a magnet.</p><p>Which, by the way, I can already do with plenty of third-party cases. And, I'm not limited to just a clear case design either. Worst case scenario, I snag a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/the-galaxy-s25-is-boring-but-a-dbrand-skin-fixes-that">dbrand skin</a> and a MagSafe ring adapter, and call it a day.</p><p>If it weren't for phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-fast-is-the-oneplus-13-charging-speed">OnePlus 13</a> with its 100W wired charging and 50W wireless charging, then we probably wouldn't be so annoyed. On top of that, Samsung making the S25 Ultra Q2.1 compliant, while limiting charging speeds, and requiring the use of a first-party case, just feels like a slap in the face.</p>

<p>Is it just me, or is it kind of ironic that when Apple makes certain changes, Samsung tends to follow suit? For instance, the iPhone 16 Pro Max is now 6.9 inches, up from the 6.7-inch 15 Pro Max. No? What about the move from a 12MP ultrawide to a 48MP ultrawide? Sound familiar?</p><p>Anyways, the only camera upgrade that Samsung introduced with the Galaxy S25 Ultra over its predecessor is a new 50MP ultrawide lens. Last year's model offered a 12MP sensor, which performed well enough but definitely fell flat in certain situations.</p>

<p>As is the case with the 200MP main lens and the 50MP telephoto sensor, you're not actually taking a 50MP ultrawide photograph. Instead, we end up right back at the 12MP "sweet spot" thanks to pixel binning. This allows for more light and detail to be captured, which can come in quite handy considering that the ultrawide camera doubles as your macro lens.</p><p>That being said, I've never really had a problem with the pictures that I've taken from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">best Samsung phones</a> over the years. My problems have stemmed from the slight delay between tapping the "Capture" button and the picture actually being taken.</p><p>However, I <em>think</em> Samsung might have solved the problem once and for all. Maybe. There are two pictures that I've included that make me feel like this $1,300 phone is actually a potato. No, like really. I don't know what happened, but neither picture should've turned out this way.</p>

<p>Other than those two anomalies, I'm almost tempted to leave my trusty Canon 70D behind and just start using the S25 Ultra for all of my photography needs moving forward. There's plenty of versatility just in the sheer number of cameras, plus, things like Expert RAW and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-customize-samsung-galaxy-camera-settings-good-lock">Camera Assistant</a> give me even more flexibility when snapping shots.</p><p>This isn't the end of the line for our Galaxy S25 Ultra camera coverage, as I'm also working on a rather in-depth camera comparison. You definitely won't want to miss it.</p>

<p>If you've used a Samsung phone in the past couple of years, you'll feel right at home with the Galaxy S25 Ultra. Yes, there are a few dramatic changes, such as the addition of Now Brief, the more "bubbly" UI, and the redesigned Notification Shade/Quick Toggles drawer. But for the most part, One UI still feels the same as before.</p><p>I can't help but feel as though the reason why Samsung waited so long to release <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a> for the Galaxy S24 series was more to do with the AI integration than the actual UI changes. Then again, there's a reason why I'm writing about it, and not working on software for Samsung or another phone maker.</p><p>UI changes aside, mostly everything about Samsung's software on the Galaxy S25 Ultra works the same. There is one curious exception, as Samsung made the odd decision to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/this-one-change-almost-ruined-the-galaxy-s25-ultra-for-me">basically hide lock screen notifications</a>. If it weren't for some others in the industry, I don't know how long it would've taken me to find the fix, but I really wish Samsung would stop making changes to basic features for seemingly no reason.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="keXMiPsvpagDqxFzRHAPK7" name="lock-screen-notification-settings-galaxy-s25-ultra" alt="Lock screen notification settings on the Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/keXMiPsvpagDqxFzRHAPK7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At the very least, it could've let everyone in on the secret ahead of time. Or maybe, add a screen that shows up during the initial setup process that lets <em>you</em> decide how you want notifications to appear.</p><p>Now that I know what the problem was and have fixed it, my phone works just as I'd have expected it to out of the box. But here we are again, at another one of those "paper-cuts" that continue to add up and cause frustrations and irritations.</p><p>That being said, for as much as I prefer Google's aesthetics, One UI is just too good to pass up. There really aren't many compromises when it comes to what you can make the Galaxy S25 Ultra do. Sure, you can't have the phone do <em>all</em> of the AI tasks locally on-device, but that's only a handful.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="ymJGfhDJUFbqMEyqRGWMUK" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review-11" alt="One UI 7 Quick Settings panel on Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ymJGfhDJUFbqMEyqRGWMUK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At least with One UI, the aforementioned problem with lock screen notifications can be remedied. It was just a matter of finding the settings panel to make the needed changes. This isn't the case with every OEM out there, as some features will simply be removed or changed without any way of "going back."</p><p>Not to mention that Samsung continues to lead the charge when it comes to software updates. Since it's being released with One UI 7 based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a>, the S25 Ultra will be officially supported for seven years, until 2032.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="y9SzGeErJAPgA6XF5Ren63" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-now-brief-news" alt="Now Brief News on Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y9SzGeErJAPgA6XF5Ren63.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you managed to sit through and read my long-winded hands-on impressions, I first want to thank you. Now, I want to apologize. I genuinely came away thinking that all of the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> and Gemini-infused features would change my life overnight. In practice, it's had very little actual impact.</p><p>While it's true that the Now Brief widget lives on my home screen, I have made checking it part of my daily routine. However, the "shimmer" is starting to wear off, as are the other features that Samsung announced.</p><p>The problem is that I just don't think this was designed for people like <em>me</em> in mind, at least not yet. Yes, my life is busy enough that it makes my head spin, but none of those problems can be solved by AI. Why? Because I work from home, and neither my one-year-old nor I ever actually leave the house.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="7LqxohqmsJjLRxM4pqNaUX" name="ask-gemini-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-3" alt="Ask Gemini prompt on Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7LqxohqmsJjLRxM4pqNaUX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Shortly after the S25 Ultra arrived, I've slowly been coming to this realization, and as a result, have been trying to manufacture ways that Galaxy AI and Gemini can "help." Maybe I'm just not thinking far enough outside of the box, but I can only go so far with trying to make things up.</p><p>Don't get me wrong. I'm not saying that it's completely useless. I'm just saying that for someone like me, and where I'm at currently in life, there's just not much that AI can do to help.</p><p>What really drove this point home was Now Brief, with it showing the same few things every day: the weather, my sleep score, upcoming calendar events, and news from topics that I don't care about and can't change. Rinse and repeat for days and weeks, and I've learned that I'm either a background character in The Truman Show or Groundhog Day.</p>
<h2 id="the-biggest-caveat-for-me-2">The biggest caveat (for me)</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="ethcrET7krxVG5L9LEfpaK" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review-1" alt="Split-screen comparison between Galaxy S25 Ultra and Z Fold 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ethcrET7krxVG5L9LEfpaK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For as great as One UI 7 seems to be so far, there's one thing that stopped me from moving my main SIM card to the Galaxy S25 Ultra. It's definitely not the lack of features, because Samsung does an excellent job at packing its flagship phones to the brim. Instead, the experience fell flat for me whenever it came to trying to use more than one app at a time.</p><p>This is completely subjective, but for me, every time I found myself wanting or needing to multitask, I was immediately reminded of my endearment for foldable phones. Of course, as an iPhone owner, I'm aware of the limitations of iOS and that you can't even use split-screen apps if you want to.</p><p>But the idea of shrinking the Galaxy S25 Ultra's display into two almost 3.5-inch screens just feels archaic. Oh and if you need to actually type in either of those app windows, you're better off just grabbing your tablet or laptop. It's definitely possible to do everything I've described, but it will definitely test your patience.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AtbWfiVBuKND7Epa9qbh53" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-iphone-16-pro-max-galaxy-z-fold-6-side-profile-1" alt="Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra with Z Fold 6, and iPhone 16 Pro Max" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AtbWfiVBuKND7Epa9qbh53.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Here's a shocking revelation that you weren't expecting — the iPhone 16 Pro Max is <em>not</em> the biggest competition to the Galaxy S25 Ultra. It's a competitor, for sure, but I'd argue that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> actually takes home that crown. Why? Well, to borrow from our review, "<em>The OnePlus 13 is the best Android phone ever made. It's the only phone  I've ever given a perfect review score because there's no area where the  phone falters or needs real improvement.</em>"</p><p>Another massive reason why the OnePlus 13 is worth consideration over the Galaxy S25 Ultra is the price. Even while "lacking" a fourth telephoto lens, the OnePlus 13 is just $899 in its base configuration with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. And if you want to get 512GB of storage, you also get 16GB of RAM, all for just another $100. I could really keep going, but just go <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">check out Nick's review</a> to see why.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a> is probably the phone that you'll see most compared to the Galaxy S25 Ultra, and for good reason. Both phones sport 6.9-inch displays, powerful camera systems, and steep price tags. However, I'd go so far as to say that the S25 Ultra is the better choice if you want the best AI experience, as Apple has a lot of work to do.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Py2DiNxKJ8Vt8kxJ4inRG3" name="asus-rog-phone-9-pro-39.jpg" alt="ASUS ROG Phone 9 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Py2DiNxKJ8Vt8kxJ4inRG3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What if you're looking for the ultimate mobile gaming experience? Then I'd point you in the direction of either the RedMagic 10 Pro or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-9-pro-review">ASUS ROG Phone 9 Pro</a>. Both phones have built-in active cooling systems, along with a few unique features that help separate them from every other slab of glass out there. Plus, they're both less expensive than the S25 Ultra when matching up storage configurations.</p><p>And if the OnePlus 13 or iPhone 16 Pro Max doesn't scratch the photography itch, there's always the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a>. In his review, Harish Jonnalagadda, Senior Editor of Asia, says "... the X200 Pro has what is arguably one of the strongest camera packages,  and the combination of the 50MP main lens and versatile zoom lens gives  it a distinct advantage."</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want one of the best Android phones of 2025.</li><li>You're already entrenched in Samsung's ecosystem.</li><li>You want to see what Galaxy AI and Gemini can do for you.</li><li>You want an extremely versatile camera system.</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You're on a budget.</li><li>You suffer from PWM.</li></ul>
<p>After realizing my excitement about the Galaxy S25 Ultra, I fully expected to finally move my personal SIM card over. Yet here I stand, some three weeks or so later, and that hasn't happened.</p><p>On paper, the S25 Ultra is everything one could want. It has the latest Galaxy AI features that are supercharged by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google Gemini</a>. Now Brief is the perfect idea if you don't have much time but want to quickly catch up on what's happening throughout the day. And I think my prayers about the camera's shutter lag have finally been answered.</p><p>If I lived in a vacuum or didn't care about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a>, there's a very good chance that the S25 Ultra would be my daily driver. In a sense, it will continue to be, but it just won't be where my main SIM card resides. Instead, it will be my main <em>Android</em> phone for the time being, at least until the next foldable phone gets announced, at which point I'll have another decision on my hands.</p><p>To answer the question posed, I probably wouldn't upgrade if I already had the Galaxy S24 Ultra. Sure, the improved ultrawide sensor is a nice touch, and the AI features could pay off, but there's just not enough yet that would sway me to do so. That being said, if you have the budget (or are due for an upgrade), and are using a phone from before 2024, then the S25 Ultra is absolutely worth it. Just make sure you do your due diligence and look around at the competition before making the final decision.</p>

Aside from minuscule design and finish updates, the base-model Galaxy S25 looks quite similar to the Galaxy S24 — and previous generations before that one.</p><p>In fact, some of the only impactful hardware upgrades to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a> — like the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset and improved connectivity protocols — might be more a testament to the breakthroughs Qualcomm has achieved rather than Samsung. And yet, despite my disdain for Samsung's complacency at times, I've thoroughly enjoyed my time with this phone.</p><p>Samsung's renewed approach to software and its close relationship with Google are big reasons why. One UI used to be a disjointed Android experience, and it felt like Google and Samsung services were sparring underneath the software skin. Now, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a> is a standout operating system that feels fast and refreshing. Galaxy AI, Google AI, and the flurry of Samsung and Google software features on the Galaxy S25 feel like they're finally working together, not competing for your attention.</p><p>That, plus the tiny form factor, makes me want to overlook the Galaxy S25's shortcomings in other areas. There are some egregious omissions here, like the camera system that hasn't been upgraded since the Galaxy S22. Slow charging speeds, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-samsung-galaxy-s25-and-s25-plus-arent-the-same">the lack of UWB support</a>, and 128GB base storage are other notable oversights.</p><p>All this adds up to make the Samsung Galaxy S25 my most frustrating recommendation yet. Yes, it's very good, and you should buy it if you want a small, light, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-small-android-phone">compact Android flagship</a>. But I'd be lying if I wasn't worried about Samsung being rewarded for bad behavior if the Galaxy S25 flies off the shelves because it certainly could've done more here.</p>

<p>Samsung announced the Galaxy S25 series <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/news/live/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2025-galaxy-s25-live-blog">at an Unpacked event in California on Jan. 22, 2025</a>. The phones became available for preorder on that date and officially released February 7. However, preorders from Samsung were delivered early this year — as early as late January.</p><p>There are three storage configurations of the Galaxy S25 available: 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB. With that being said, the 128GB variant isn't available in Australia, and the 512GB variant isn't available in North America. Despite rumors of a price hike, the Galaxy S25 matches the pricing tiers of the Galaxy S24.</p>

<p>It's clear from a look down the spec sheet that the Galaxy S25 has to offer something unique to make buyers look past its shortcomings. For example, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a> is a more complete package while costing only $100 more, which doesn't bode well for Samsung's base model. The good news is that Samsung did create something unique with the Galaxy S25. It's perhaps the last small Android flagship left.</p><p>I know, I know — it's crazy to say that a 6.2-inch smartphone is <em>small</em>. As a fond former iPhone 12 mini user, I feel you. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-small-android-phone">Small phone</a> lovers like myself simply have to acknowledge that with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-12-ultra-review">the departure of the Asus Zenfone (as we knew it)</a>, the category is on life support. Unless you count clamshell foldables like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>, the Galaxy S25 is indeed the smallest 2025 flagship you can buy today.</p><p>While the iPhone and Pixel keep growing larger, the Galaxy S25 is getting smaller. The display on the Galaxy S25 is still 6.2 inches, but Samsung shrunk the chassis in every way. It's smaller, thinner, and lighter than the Galaxy S24. If that wasn't enough, the Galaxy S25 is also more compact than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Google Pixel 9</a> and iPhone 16 in every dimension.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JnkogAMm5hhnMqbLLYeFu7" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-iPhone-16-Pixel-9" alt="A size comparison between the Samsung Galaxy S25 (left), iPhone 16 (middle), and Google Pixel 9 (right) on a record table." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JnkogAMm5hhnMqbLLYeFu7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A size comparison between the Samsung Galaxy S25 (left), iPhone 16 (middle), and Google Pixel 9 (right) on a record table. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To get specific, the Galaxy S25 measures 146.9 x 70.5 x 7.2 mm and weighs just 162 grams. Those numbers don't quite convey how much thinner and lighter this phone feels compared to the competition. The base Pixel 9, for instance, weighs a whopping 198 grams. I already enjoyed the form factor of the Galaxy S24, and the Galaxy S25 feels better in every way. Although the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25#section-samsung-galaxy-s25-edge">Galaxy S25 Edge</a> may be thinner when it releases, its rumored 6.8-inch screen will help the Galaxy S25 keep the title of best small phone through the year.</p><p>Overall, the design of the Galaxy S25 feels like a mix of the design trends we saw on Galaxy foldables and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a>. There are still the same flat aluminum side rails with rounded corners and chamfered edges, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/corning-gorilla-glass-victus-2">Gorilla Glass Victus 2</a> on the front and back. Meanwhile, the rear camera lenses now have DSLR-style covers, matching the Galaxy foldables. While familiar, I have no complaints about the Galaxy S25's build — although <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-gorilla-armor-2">Gorilla Armor and its anti-reflective properties</a> would've been a big addition.</p><p>Though some are quick to point out that the sharper edges of the Galaxy S25's design can be uncomfortable to hold, I don't think this is much of an issue on the base model. It's small enough that you should be able to hold it with one hand without needing to shove the corner into your palm. For the Plus or Ultra models, it may be something to consider.</p>

<p>When I reviewed the Galaxy S24 last year, I said that the display's bezels appeared smaller than any other phone I've tested. That's still visually apparent with the Galaxy S25, regardless of whether it's actually true. Especially with a light-colored phone, the contrast of the matte aluminum rails and the black display edges make bezels look half the size — and more than other flagships.</p><p>Compared to the Galaxy S24, the screen-to-body ratio has only increased by 0.2% on the Galaxy S25, so both devices will feel similar. The similarities probably have something to do with the fact that both phones appear to have the exact same display panel. It's an AMOLED 2X display that goes up to 120Hz with a variable refresh rate, HDR10+, and 2,600 nits of maximum brightness. The resolution is 1080 x 2340 pixels, meaning it's only FHD+. As a result, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-samsung-galaxy-s25-and-s25-plus-arent-the-same">Galaxy S25 doesn't have the ProScaler for QHD+</a> that's now available on the Plus and Ultra models.</p><p>The lack of upgrades doesn't change the fact that the Galaxy S25 looks stunning in most conditions. If I had to nitpick, the brightness could be improved. Other handsets can do much better, and out-of-the-box brightness outdoors should be higher. Samsung's adaptive brightness tends to be too conservative, so I'd recommend disabling this and flipping on the "extra brightness" option if you're like me and love a bright screen. Of course, this comes at the expense of battery life.</p><p>Around the edges, you'll find a volume rocker and a side button used for power and voice assistant control. The side button can be mapped to Gemini for quick access to agentic assistance. On the bottom, there's a speaker grill, a USB 3.2 Type-C port that supports DisplayPort Alt Mode, and a physical SIM card tray. The right side merely offers a mmWave cutout for enhanced 5G connectivity.</p><p>To sum up, don't overlook the Galaxy S25's form factor. Its thinness and lightness, paired with the power we'll get to next, makes it a compelling option in a sea of large flagships.</p>

<p>The hardware on the inside of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus is both the best and worst thing about this device. Let's start with the good. It's powered by the  <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> for Galaxy chipset, which was co-designed by Samsung and Qualcomm. This mobile platform is based on the Snapdragon X lineup, the laptop and desktop-class processors made using Qualcomm's custom Oryon cores. In essence, it means that the Galaxy S25 is the most powerful Android phone on the market.</p><p>This is reflected in benchmark tests, where the Galaxy S25 came out on top in Geekbench 6 runs. It decisively beat the Google Pixel 9, a phone that uses the underpowered <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> processor. Previously, Google had the edge in AI, with 45 tokens per second supported for AI operations on the Pixel 9.</p><p>Samsung and Qualcomm completely flipped the script with the Galaxy S25. It can process up to 70 tokens per second for AI tasks, dethroning the Pixel 9. With performance, AI processing, and Galaxy optimization, it looks like the Galaxy S25 is the top-performing base model of any flagship offering in 2025.</p>

<p>What does that mean for daily use? It's twofold. First, it is unlikely that you'll notice the speed difference between the Galaxy S25 and another capable flagship while holding them side-by-side. Smartphones have been really fast for a while now, and we don't need Geekbench 6 scores to know it.</p><p>Second, it <em>is</em> likely that the massive performance increase of the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset will aid the Galaxy S25's longevity. Samsung is promising seven years of software support, and I suspect the Galaxy S25 will have an easier time achieving that than the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3-powered Galaxy S24.</p><p>This is not the kind of year-over-year performance improvement we usually see in smartphone SoCs. It's a once-in-a-decade type of upgrade, and that's why I can see the argument for upgrading now to the Galaxy S25 if you've been waiting a while.</p><p>To test how the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy pushes the battery and cooling system in the Galaxy S25 to its limits, I ran the 3DMark Wild Life Extreme stress test, which is a graphics-heavy test lasting 20 minutes in a continuous loop. I surprisingly found that the Galaxy S25 didn't get scolding hot to the touch. It got warm but didn't overheat like other flagships have in recent years.</p><p>However, the loop score during the stress test continually decreased over the course of the 20-minute stress test. The Galaxy S25 hit a peak of 15,336 in the second loop and dipped under 11,000 by the 13th loop. It finished with a final loop of 10,991. What does this all mean? Essentially, the Galaxy S25 will slow down the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy processor to keep the phone cool. As a result, its internal temperature only increased by 5 degrees Celsius during the test and used just 11% battery.</p><p>To be clear, this is a good result. You want a phone to know its limits and slow down before burning itself up and losing a ton of battery for the sake of a few extra frames while gaming.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oQXsfWgx7ttJjGj6zGVDaL" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-16" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy S25 outdoors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oQXsfWgx7ttJjGj6zGVDaL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I said that the hardware was also the worst thing about the Samsung Galaxy S25, and here's why. There are some omissions that are extremely hard to justify. For starters, you don't get an ultra-wideband (UWB) chip on the base model Galaxy S25 — you have to upgrade to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-review">Galaxy S25 Plus</a> or Ultra for that. It creates a situation where if you plan to use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-2-announcement">Samsung's own SmartTag trackers</a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/find-my-device">Google Find My Device network</a> over the life of your smartphone, you shouldn't buy the Galaxy S25.</p><p>Additionally, the Galaxy S25 still charges painfully slow. It only charges at 25W over a cable, which is unacceptable for a flagship in 2025. Wireless charging isn't that much better. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-support-qi2-wireless-charging">It supports the Qi2.1 standard</a>, offering 15W wireless charging and 4.5W reverse wireless charging. It doesn't have internal magnets, so you can't use MagSafe accessories without a case. I may be in the minority here, but I think slapping a thick MagSafe case on the Galaxy S25 defeats the purpose of it being a compact phone.</p><p>Those are just a few small missed opportunities that might not matter much today but could limit you down the road if you plan to keep this phone for five or more years. There's still plenty of good, like the processor, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/wi-fi-7-explained">Wi-Fi 7 support</a>, and Bluetooth 5.4 support.</p>

<p>The phone's battery capacity is 4,000mAh, just like last year. A bigger battery would be nice, but I can live with this capacity in this form factor. For most people, the Galaxy S25 should offer all-day battery life. I consistently got 6+ hours of screen-on time with a mix of phone calls, video streaming, camera usage, and social media doom-scrolling. That was paired with about 10+ hours of screen-off time between charges.</p><p>Most of the time, the Galaxy S25 lasts all day. If you're able to briefly top off the battery at various times throughout the day, you'll be golden. I find this easy to do, simply keeping a cable or wireless charging pad at my desk and in the car.</p>

<p>Samsung reused the rear camera system in the Galaxy 25 for the fourth straight smartphone generation. That's right — the Galaxy S25 and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s22-review">Galaxy S22</a> share camera sensors. You get a 50MP, f/1.8 main sensor, a 12MP, f/2.2 ultrawide with a 120-degree field of view, and a 12MP, f/2.2 telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom. The hardware is decent enough, but it's old and performs like you'd expect of four-year-old lenses.</p><p>The one entirely positive thing I can say about the Galaxy S25's cameras is that they include a telephoto sensor, which is crucial and isn't a given on flagships of this size. Some phones, like the iPhone 16 and Pixel 9, try to fake optical zoom using a technique called sensor crop. Nothing beats the real thing, and I love that the Galaxy S25 gives you 3x optical zoom in a 6.2-inch device.</p><p>Paired with the ultrawide lens, the camera system makes for varying zoom levels, as shown in the gallery below.</p>

<p>Samsung tries to make the most of the same camera hardware with computational photography improvements, like usual. There's some evidence to suggest that the Galaxy S25 is improved in a few areas, such as shutter lag and motion blur. However, keep expectations tame. The Samsung Galaxy S25's camera is still no match for a moving car on a nighttime street.</p><p>I've also found the Galaxy S25 camera to produce colors that look slightly dull compared to cameras in other flagships. I'm glad that Samsung doesn't take the Pixel approach, which includes over-saturating colors and adding faux vibrancy. I do think iPhone shots have a better natural pop of color, though.</p>

<p>The front-facing camera is only 12MP, but it gets the job done. Put simply, you're not buying the Galaxy S25 for its camera system. If that's something you really care about, you have no choice but to look to the OnePlus 13 or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-week-later">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> for that.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kdfDyBSxTimtUY3xTAF4TF" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-15" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy S25 outdoors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kdfDyBSxTimtUY3xTAF4TF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I've been a consistent critic of Samsung's software approach, specifically One UI, in recent years. It got to the point that I refused to consider Samsung phones as my daily driver. That's why it should say a lot that I <em>love</em> One UI 7. I'm not sure if it's leaped the Pixel Launcher yet, but it's ahead of OxygenOS, Hello UI, and iOS in my book. That's something I couldn't even fathom saying before trying One UI 7 on the Galaxy S25.</p><p>What makes One UI 7 so great? It's hard to pinpoint one feature or two — it's more about how fresh and new the operating system feels. I prefer the split control panel/notification shade from iOS, and I genuinely like the bubbly and rounded look of One UI now. The app drawer is better, too. You can finally switch between One UI and other Android skins without the learning curve. Everything just makes sense.</p><p>Another big reason for my newfound One UI 7 love affair is the integration between Google and Samsung apps and services. The two companies are finally figuring out how to work together and deliver a cohesive software experience. It comes down to the little things, like how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-wants-you-to-move-to-google-messages-and-its-for-the-best">Google Messages is the default and only messaging app</a> installed on the Galaxy S25. Or how the supercharged Gemini assistant is accessible with the press of a side button and can take multi-app actions on your behalf.</p><p>Of course, there's more to improve. Samsung should work on cutting down on the bloat further and eliminating unnecessary third-party apps from stock One UI. I don't know why my Galaxy S25 ships with LinkedIn and other Microsoft apps, but I hate it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2RRfCrPeXza8RW2cdMpQaF" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-3" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy S25 outdoors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2RRfCrPeXza8RW2cdMpQaF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It wasn't too long ago when I recommended that Android buyers pick a Pixel due to Google's exclusive perks. Now, the situation feels reversed. The Galaxy S25 gets many of Google's best AI features, from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>, and it gets Samsung's full Galaxy AI suite. It's like the best of both worlds.</p><p>Not every AI feature will be worth using. The Now Bar, a pill-shaped center for information, is overhyped by Samsung. If you're deep in the Samsung ecosystem or use select supported services like Spotify, it'll be neat. But I usually don't wear a Galaxy wearable and use Apple Music, so my Now Bar just told me the weather and inspirational quotes all day. Which, hey, is nice. Just not all that useful.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NbsRmMjmFw7kLPqE4k7V2n" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Object-Editing" alt="Removing a drink from my hand with Samsung object editing." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NbsRmMjmFw7kLPqE4k7V2n.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One thing worth calling out is how good Samsung's image editing features have gotten over the years. Object removal and generative editing with Galaxy AI is hands-down better than anything Apple or Google offer, as you can see above.</p><p>To sum up, if you haven't used One UI in a while or have been disappointed by it in the past, it's time to give it a second chance.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-s25-competition"><span>Samsung Galaxy S25: Competition</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XfmkyCPpB6UtqsQefd4haL" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-iPhone-16-Pixel-9-2" alt="The Galaxy S25, Pixel 9, and iPhone 16 lying on a table." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XfmkyCPpB6UtqsQefd4haL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At the moment, the $799 Samsung Galaxy S25's biggest competitors are the Google Pixel 9 and the iPhone 16. You could argue that prospective Galaxy S25 buyers probably aren't considering an iPhone 16 and vice versa, so that leaves the Pixel 9 — also priced at $799.</p><p>There are some who will prefer Google's software or camera profile to that of the Galaxy S25, but I have a hard time swallowing how much bigger and heavier the Pixel is without providing enough benefits. The Samsung phone is thinner, lighter, and more compact but also faster and more capable.</p><p>With the Pixel 9 and iPhone 16 out of the way, there isn't a phone that directly competes with the Galaxy S25 in terms of size. However, if you're looking for an Android flagship for around $800 and can live with a bigger screen, consider the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> for $100 more. It's only a smidge slower than the Galaxy S25 while offering a better display, better camera, faster charging, and more base storage. This is the phone I'd buy if I were looking for a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra-esque phone at near-base Galaxy S25 prices.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want a small phone with the latest Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy processor</li><li>You have an older Galaxy phone, or aren't worried about camera quality</li><li>You want the best of both worlds with Google AI and Galaxy AI, and like One UI 7</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if...</strong></p>

<p>After spending time with the Samsung Galaxy S25, two things are simultaneously true. This is a standout compact flagship, and Samsung also could've given it more upgrades. It feels like it's the same story every time a Galaxy device is released. There's just enough to make the Galaxy S25 a really compelling device and just as many recycled ideas and components to make buyers hesitate.</p><p>As I mentioned before, I'm concerned that buying the Galaxy S25 signals to Samsung that releasing four generations of phones with the same camera system is acceptable. It's simply not, and it feels like a sales hit <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-samsung-sorry-for-failing-to-innovate-or-just-sorry-sales-are-down">may be the only thing that pushes Samsung to innovate more</a>. The phone's cameras, charging speeds, durability ratings, and connectivity capabilities are just the quick hits of things Samsung could've easily improved with the Galaxy S25 — but chose not to.</p><p>I'm also aware that most smartphone buyers aren't trying to make a statement with their phone purchases. Most people just want a good, powerful, and reliable device, and the Samsung Galaxy S25 checks all those boxes. It's also perhaps the only compact Android flagship left on the market today. That's how I'm able to recommend it despite my frustration with how much Samsung reused from prior Galaxy generations.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>There is a report that Samsung is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-uwb-earphones-patent/">preparing to launch</a> a set of earbuds that use UWB (Ultra-Wide Band radios) to allow for mountains more music data to make its way to your ears. I have no idea if this is true and, if it is, when Samsung might launch a product like this, but I do know the company has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://image-ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/20250039604" target="_blank">filed a patent</a> to do just that. I also know it is a fabulous idea that needs to happen.</p><p>This would fix the one flaw with Bluetooth headphones — poor bandwidth. That's a pretty big deal.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-uwb-2">What is UWB?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="FJfzsJGzpmwkM8bxgNoYzJ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-UWB-01" alt="Ultra Wide-Band (UWB) support on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FJfzsJGzpmwkM8bxgNoYzJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-embraces-future-ultra-wideband-apis-android">UWB</a> is a radio tech that uses high-bandwidth and short-range radios to send a lot of data from one device to another. If you're the engineering or ham radio type of person, it's simply a new name for pulse radio >500 MHz with a complete set of standards.</p><p>You probably know that phone carriers use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/explaining-5g-millimeter-wave-sub-6-low-band-and-other-terms-you-need-know">UWB to send 5G signals</a> and are probably disappointed by the results. UWB for 5G can be great (and probably is in a few places), but what it has in bandwidth is that it lacks in range.</p><p>The theoretical range of a UWB signal is 200 meters or about 650 feet. The realistic range is 50 meters with an uninterrupted line of sight. UWB for 5G does work, but it works best with cell sites every 30-40 meters placed above vehicle and foot traffic. Since that's hard to do, UWB 5G can be spotty and finicky unless you're in the sweet spot.</p><p>UWB is not just for cellular radios, though. It transfers data across a very wide slice of bandwidth, meaning it can send lots of it very fast. It doesn't care what the data is — it might be phone data from your carrier, it could be a signal to unlock a door, or it could be talking to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/testing-new-google-find-my-device-trackers">a device tracker</a>. It's just really good at sending big bursts of data over short distances and doing it without using a lot of power.</p>
<h2 id="why-use-it-for-headphones-2">Why use it for headphones?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2047px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="33NhG82db6SKwc694LKQmM" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Buds-2-Pro-all-colors-01.jpg" alt="All three Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/33NhG82db6SKwc694LKQmM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2047" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p>Using UWB for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-true-wireless-headphones">wireless headphones</a> is both a great idea and a potentially costly one. Let's get the bad news out of the way first.</p><p>Right now, not every phone supports UWB. Most new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S models</a> offer it, as does the iPhone, then the list gets a lot slimmer. Google Pixels have it, as do some phones from Xiaomi. I'm sure some phone I can't think of supports it, too, but the idea is that the list is short, and there aren't any real budget models with it. You and I might like our "flagship" phones, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones" target="_blank">those budget models</a> make up the bulk of the 4 billion phones that are in use today.</p><p>So, most phones won't be able to take advantage of anything these rumored headphones have to offer. And they are going to be expensive, at least until the cost to develop them has been offset by a little profit. Apple can get away with telling its customers they <em><strong>have</strong></em> to buy this shiny new thing, but Samsung can't. The product could bomb as soon as it's released, even if it works perfectly. That's a costly mistake that will make some heads roll in Korea.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1919px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.18%;"><img id="RJZWCjm3rGhHww5MvptQAK" name="Samsung-unpacked-Feb-2023-s23-family-02.jpg" alt="Galaxy S23 at Unpacked Feb 2023" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RJZWCjm3rGhHww5MvptQAK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1919" height="1078" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I'm going to ignore the "bad idea" part of this rumor because I like the "good idea" part so much. You probably shouldn't do that and do the whole grain of salt thing.</p><p>The problem with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">Bluetooth headphones</a> of any shape or size is that they sound terrible. You might think they sound OK, but they still sound terrible, especially when trying to reproduce very high-frequency or very low-frequency sounds or sounds of multiple frequencies at the same time.</p><p>This isn't a "feelings" thing, either. They sound worse than wired headphones because of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/bluetooth-5-it-actually-better-and-do-you-need-it">Bluetooth's terrible bandwidth</a>. Companies have tried new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bluetooth-audio-terms-codecs-explained">codecs</a> (encoder/decoder, a way to compress music at its source and decompress it at the destination) to fight this, and they do help. Bluetooth sounds a lot better than it used to sound.</p><p>If the connection between the source (your phone) and the receiver (the headphones) had a higher bandwidth connection, it would be a lot easier to fix that terrible-sounding music. A stream of digital music is just data. It's the same as uploading a picture to Instagram or filing your homework in an online portal — ones and zeros fly across space and time. When more ones and more zeros can fly, we see faster data rates. Music would be the same — it could sound better because more of it can be sent.</p><p>Headphones are an excellent platform for UWB because of the tech's limitations: short range, optimal with a line of sight. You're going to be within 50 meters of your phone while listening to music wirelessly, and your phone in your back pocket is still mostly in the line of sight of the headphones. UWB is really good at passing through the human body, which is why <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://raybaby.us/">a RayBaby</a> infant health monitor works so well.</p>
<hr>
<p>I really hope Samsung ends up making the things and the product survives long enough to become mainstream. I doubt you would be able to send uncompressed audio data over UWB, and more bandwidth means ample room for better codecs that allow more sound to be transferred on the go.</p><p>I'd buy a pair, and I might be able to cut yet another cord — the one to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.campfireaudio.com/products/solaris-stellar-horizon" target="_blank">my headphones</a>.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>ASUS was onto a good thing with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-9-review">Zenfone 9</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-10-review">Zenfone 10</a>. The Taiwanese manufacturer stood out by delivering small phones with the best possible hardware, and they were genuinely enjoyable to use. While I usually prefer larger phones, I'll agree that both the Zenfone 9 and Zenfone 10 offered something that was sorely lacking. <br><br>That's why it was puzzling to see ASUS switch tack with last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-11-ultra-review">Zenfone 11 Ultra</a>, reverting to a slab of a phone that was basically a rebadged version of its gaming device. The strategy didn't make much sense to me; in choosing to go back to a bigger phone, the brand lost the distinctiveness that made earlier models notable, and the device as a whole wasn't anywhere as good as the Zenfone 10. <br><br>Annoyingly, the Zenfone 12 Ultra doesn't do anything to rectify the situation this year — you get roughly the same design as the Zenfone 11 Ultra, and barring iterative updates, there isn't anything new. I was holding out on ASUS going back to a smaller design this time around, but that isn't the case. <br><br>While I still like the combination of hardware and software, the Zenfone 12 Ultra just doesn't do enough to distinguish itself against Chinese rivals that have much better camera systems, and ASUS's lackluster software update policy ultimately makes the device a non-starter.</p>

<p>ASUS unveiled the Zenfone 12 Ultra on February 6, and the device is launching in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Europe initially. The phone will be sold in a single 16GB/512GB variant outside Taiwan, and it will cost €1,099 ($1,141). To incentivize the launch, ASUS is discounting the device by €100 until February 28, so buyers will be able to pick it up at €999 ($1,037). <br><br>ASUS doesn't have definite plans to launch the Zenfone 12 Ultra in the U.S. or U.K. at the moment, and I'll add an update if that situation changes. It is possible we might see the device debut in North America at a later point — that has been the case in previous years — but it isn't a given at this point.</p>

<p>I managed to break the Zenfone 12 Ultra after just three days of use, so that's as good a place to start as any. The device slid out of my pocket and hit the floor, and even though the distance was just over two feet, the angle of impact — along an edge — meant that it picked up a spiderweb of cracks originating at the back. <br><br>Let's talk about the protection — or lack thereof. The Zenfone 12 Ultra has a glass back with Gorilla Glass 3, and while the protective layer does a great job against scratches, it doesn't do much against tumbles (as evidenced with my unit). Most phones I use these days come with Gorilla Glass Victus or Victus 2, and they have much better resilience against tumbles.</p>

<p>Brands like Vivo and Honor are using their own glass protective layers on their latest phones, and after extended use involving a half-dozen drops, I didn't notice any damage on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">X200 Pro</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Magic 7 Pro</a>.

<p>I guess the acute angle of impact probably contributed to the glass breaking, and it made using the phone all the more annoying as I had to put it in a case. Another point of contention is that because ASUS doesn't sell the Zenfone 12 Ultra in as many regions as it used to, there's no way to reliably get the rear glass changed — ASUS has no plans to launch the phone in India.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="oGozhiwyxcHdxSM2rbo9PR" name="ASUS Zenfone 12 Ultra" alt="ASUS Zenfone 12 Ultra back view in case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oGozhiwyxcHdxSM2rbo9PR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Annoyingly, there aren't many accessories either. I tend to prefer ultra-thin cases as they don't add too much heft to the phone, but most case brands aren't releasing accessories for the device, so your choices are very limited in this regard. ASUS bundled a bulky Rhinoshield case with the phone, and that's the one I had to go with.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="z3kVUTSrGBayU96ugGJ9SR" name="ASUS Zenfone 12 Ultra" alt="ASUS Zenfone 12 Ultra showing broken glass back" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/z3kVUTSrGBayU96ugGJ9SR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The design of the phone itself isn't particularly noteworthy. You basically get a plain glass back with a rectangular camera island, and the design is largely forgettable. There isn't any defining feature to the phone, and it just doesn't look like a flagship that costs over $1,000.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="48iY9R2P2ZJY7VU94Zu9PR" name="ASUS Zenfone 12 Ultra" alt="ASUS Zenfone 12 Ultra bottom view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/48iY9R2P2ZJY7VU94Zu9PR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's an aluminum mid-frame, and ASUS says it's using 100% recycled aluminum this time, which is good to see. The Ebony Black variant doesn't stand out, but you can get the phone in Sakura White and Sage Green, with the green model the best of the lot. <br><br>Because the phone uses the same foundation as ASUS's gaming-oriented devices, the USB-C port is located to the side. This is inconvenient if you're trying to slot the phone into a mobile controller like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/gamesir-g8-galileo-review">GameSir G8 Galileo</a>, or charge the device when it's on a phone stand.</p>

<p>While the Zenfone 12 Ultra is lighter than last year at 220g, it is bulkier and taller than most other phones I used recently. Honestly, ASUS should have stuck with the flamboyant styling and bright hues that made the Zenfone 9 and 10 so distinctive — I used budget phones that have better character.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="XtUPZRuCtmpCY44uZcKGXR" name="ASUS Zenfone 12 Ultra" alt="ASUS Zenfone 12 Ultra home page" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XtUPZRuCtmpCY44uZcKGXR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>ASUS isn't making any changes to the panel this year, so the Zenfone 12 Ultra comes with the same 6.78-inch Samsung AMOLED panel as its predecessor. It uses LTPO tech to dynamically adjust refresh between 1Hz to 120Hz, and it goes up to 144Hz in select games. <br><br>The 2400 x 1080 resolution is unchanged as well, as is the max brightness of 2500 nits when viewing HDR content. While the Vivo X200 Pro, Pixel 9 Pro XL, and Magic 7 Pro get brighter in regular use, there are no inherent issues with the Zenfone 12 Ultra in this regard — the panel is readable under harsh sunlight.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="gpjNsvMzSQCCt9GZSrXYWR" name="ASUS Zenfone 12 Ultra" alt="ASUS Zenfone 12 Ultra home page with device in a case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gpjNsvMzSQCCt9GZSrXYWR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>ASUS knows how to calibrate the panels on its phones, and the Zenfone 12 Ultra has great colors out of the box, and you get a good amount of customizability when it comes to adjusting the color balance. The bezels are just as thin as last year, and it makes using the device just that little bit more exciting. Also, the optical fingerprint sensor is located in the ideal position, and I had no problems accessing it. <br><br>You even get a 3.5mm jack, with ASUS being the only brand to still offer the feature on a high-end phone. It's not just the inclusion of the analog jack either; ASUS put in a lot of work to deliver great audio, and the collaboration with Dirac genuinely makes a difference.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the screen is protected by Gorilla Glass Victus 2, and the only thing I'll say about it is that ASUS should have used the same coating at the back too. Gaming or consuming content on the device is highly enjoyable, and other than the limited selection of always-on styles, I don't have any problems with the panel on the phone.</p>

<p>ASUS clearly knows how to make phones with top-notch hardware, and the Zenfone 12 Ultra is a true powerhouse. Similar to its predecessors, the device comes with the latest Qualcomm silicon, and it is about the fastest mobile chipset available today — it even outshines the A18 in single-core workloads. <br><br>I got the 16GB/512GB variant of the device, and this is the variant that ASUS is rolling out globally. ASUS did a fantastic job setting up the phone, and it absolutely flies — this is the fastest phone I used in 2025. There are no slowdowns, no glitches or stutters, and the phone does a terrific job in demanding games. It has stricter thermal limitations than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-9-pro-review">ROG Phone 9 Pro</a>, and honestly, that's a good thing; the phone doesn't get absurdly hot, but it still manages to deliver stable framerates.</p>

<p>It shouldn't be astonishing that the Zenfone 12 Ultra posted the highest scores in the likes of Geekbench 6. A higher thermal limit than most other devices in this category — it went up to 46 degrees in 3DMark's Steel Nomad stress test — combined with great optimization gives the phone a distinct advantage, and even though it isn't branded as such, this is basically one of the best Android gaming phones you can get today.</p>
<p>There are plenty of cool additions as well; ASUS has a back tap gesture that's inherently customizable, and interestingly, the gesture works even with a bulky case. ASUS also leverages the entire Qualcomm suite of options, so you get the AptX HD and AptX Lossless codecs as standard. <br><br>I didn't run into any issues with connectivity — either in the house or outside — and other than the vibration motor lacking granularity, there are no problems whatsoever with the hardware. ASUS continues to excel in this area, and if you want a powerful phone designed for gaming, you'll love what the Zenfone 12 Ultra has to offer.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CbitaGw8Se49Gq3ZPFhARR" name="ASUS Zenfone 12 Ultra" alt="ASUS Zenfone 12 Ultra battery stats" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CbitaGw8Se49Gq3ZPFhARR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming to the battery side of things, the phone gets the same 5500mAh battery as last year. It's split into dual 2750mAh units, and uses the standard USB PD 65W protocol to charge, so you can use any PD charger with ease. This is relevant, because ASUS no longer bundles a charger in the box. I'm annoyed that other Android brands are starting to follow Samsung and Google, and I don't see why ASUS couldn't just bundle the charger with the package. <br><br>Anyway, the phone lasts a day without any problems, and there's no anxiety whatsoever with regards to the battery running out before the end of the day — even with heavy use. It takes 44 minutes to charge the battery using a 65W PD charger, and while it isn't the longest-lasting device I tested in 2025 — that's the Vivo X200 Pro — it easily lasts a day, and that's good enough.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-asus-zenfone-12-ultra-cameras"><span>ASUS Zenfone 12 Ultra: Cameras</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wbqwMmevvdhvbetyNNxLVR" name="ASUS Zenfone 12 Ultra" alt="ASUS Zenfone 12 Ultra back view in case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wbqwMmevvdhvbetyNNxLVR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>ASUS went with a 50MP main camera that features Sony's Lytia-700 imaging module, and you get a 32MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom, and a 13MP wide-angle lens. Alongside the new main camera, ASUS tweaked the gimbal stabilization system to allow the device to take even better videos. Outside of that, there are no differences to the Zenfone 11 Ultra — ASUS is using the same lenses on the auxiliary cameras as last year. <br><br>The camera interface hasn't changed from last year, but there's a document scanning option now, and an easier way to trigger a timer. You get the usual AI-assisted shooting modes, and they do a decent enough job ensuring the subject is always in focus. The new gimbal stabilization tech is better than last year, and you see a noticeable difference when you move around whilst taking videos. <br><br>However, video quality itself isn't the best, and the Zenfone 12 Ultra doesn't come anywhere close to its rivals in this area. Annoyingly, 4K60 video is limited to the main camera, so you can't use the mode with the auxiliary sensors. This severely inhibits the versatility of the cameras, and honestly, if you plan on taking a lot of videos, I'd suggest getting the Vivo X200 Pro instead.</p>

<p>Coming to photos, the Zenfone 12 Ultra has good dynamic range and color accuracy in daylight shots, and foliage is rendered accurately without any aggressive artifacting. It has issues focusing at times, and it doesn't do anywhere as well as the Pixel 9 Pro XL or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Honor Magic 7 Pro</a> at taking photos of fast-moving subjects. <br><br>The auxiliary lenses are decent enough, but yet again, they don't have the same level of detail or color fidelity as other high-end phones, and this is noticeable in low-light imagery. The main camera, however, does a much better job in challenging situations than previous years, and I have no qualms about that sensor. <br><br>I seem to say this every year, but the Zenfone 12 Ultra has the best camera package ASUS delivered to date. However, it isn't anywhere as good as what other Chinese brands are offering at the moment. If you don't intend to use the cameras too much and instead want a powerful phone that also takes passable photos, the Zenfone 12 Ultra is still a good choice. But if you want best-in-class imaging modules and camera tuning, you'll need to get the X200 Pro or the Find X8 Pro.</p>

<p>ASUS has one of the best software interfaces of any Android phone today. There isn't a vanilla UI as such with Android these days, but the Taiwanese brand did a great job balancing minimal styling with extensive customizability, and using the interface evokes fond memories of OxygenOS 9.5. <br><br>The interface is optimized incredibly well, and it has better fluidity than just about any other phone today — including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a>, Vivo X200 Pro, Honor Magic 7 Pro, and the Pixel 9 Pro XL. It's just a delight to use the UI, and I'm a fan of the customizability on offer; you can endlessly tweak gestures, styling of the volume slider and notification pane, power menu, call screen, and so much more.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="p6eCwDjRia5UFYuN4jnyTR" name="ASUS Zenfone 12 Ultra" alt="ASUS Zenfone 12 Ultra AI utilities page" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p6eCwDjRia5UFYuN4jnyTR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Basically, ASUS put in the work in rolling out utilities you'll actually end up using, and that alone makes ZenUI stand out. The phone runs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> out of the box, and like every other manufacturer, ASUS is doubling down on AI. Thankfully, ASUS clearly delineates between cloud and on-device AI, so if you don't want your data going to a server, you can just choose to use the built-in language models. <br><br>There's good news on that front, with ASUS noting that the Zenfone 12 Ultra uses Meta's Llama 3 8B language model to power on-device AI summarization. You also get real-time translation and semantic search — where it searches metadata to pull up useful info — and both of these are run entirely on-device. AI-assisted transcribing, document summaries, and article summaries use a combination of cloud and on-device AI, and all of these features do a good enough job in regular use. <br><br>Look, I'm not the biggest fan of AI features, and my usage of most of these utilities extends to testing them out for the review. But I do so with all phones that cross my desk, and I'll admit that ASUS does a better job in this regard than most manufacturers. I still think Google has the definite edge when it comes to phone-based AI utilities, but ASUS is doing all the right things.</p>
<p>Talking about doing the right thing, the one area where ASUS needs to be better is software updates. The Zenfone 12 Ultra will get just two Android platform updates and five years of security updates, and that just isn't enough. Even budget phones now routinely offer three updates — like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Nothing's Phone 2a</a> — so there's no excuse for a device that costs over $1,000 to get two platform updates in 2025. <br><br>This has always been a sore point with ASUS's devices in the past, and I assumed the brand would change its stance in 2025 — that just isn't the case.</p>

<p>If you need a high-end phone in 2025, you should consider getting the OnePlus 13. OnePlus nailed the basics this time, with the device featuring a design that's better to hold and use. The blue leather model in particular looks striking, and after nearly a month of use, I didn't see any issues with durability or build quality. <br><br>The cameras are outstanding, and the hardware is among the best you can get today. While it doesn't match the Zenfone 12 Ultra at gaming, that's about the only negative I can think of. The battery lasts a day and a half, it doesn't take as long to charge, and the software is optimized incredibly well. In short, the OnePlus 13 is the new yardstick, and coming in at $899, it doesn't cost as much as ASUS's offering. <br><br>If you don't need the best cameras, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nubia-z70-ultra-review">Nubia's Z70 Ultra</a> is a decent alternative. It also has terrific hardware, and while the software isn't anywhere as good as the Zenfone 12 Ultra, it has a relatively clean UI and is optimized very well. And at $729, it is a much better value.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-asus-zenfone-12-ultra-should-you-buy-it"><span>ASUS Zenfone 12 Ultra: Should you buy it?</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GNo2WuCRAsUTjM8PgHTmWR" name="ASUS Zenfone 12 Ultra" alt="ASUS Zenfone 12 Ultra home page" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GNo2WuCRAsUTjM8PgHTmWR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You should buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You want the best hardware package</li><li>You need clean software without any bloat</li><li>You want terrific battery life</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You need long-term Android updates</li><li>You want the best cameras</li><li>You need a phone with a stylish design</li></ul>
<p>I tend to like ASUS's phones for one simple reason: the software is tuned to my tastes. The clean interface along with extensive customizability and great optimization leads to an experience that's enjoyable, and it is a genuine differentiator. Of course, the hardware plays a big part in this as well, and ASUS has once again delivered one of the strongest hardware packages around. <br><br>But that's the thing — while I like using the phone quite a bit, I wouldn't recommend it. Given that the Zenfone 12 Ultra is a high-end device, I'll have to judge it against other flagships, and it just doesn't measure up in a lot of areas; the cameras don't come close to the X200 Pro, Honor Magic 7 Pro, or the Pixel 9 Pro XL, the design isn't distinctive enough, and ASUS's middling software update policy is infuriating. <br><br>It's not that the Zenfone 12 Ultra is a bad phone — far from it — but it is going up against strong rivals, and I can't help but feel that it just isn't good enough for what it costs. These shortcomings would have been excusable on a $500 phone, but the Zenfone 12 Ultra costs more than double that, and in this category, even minor flaws become deal-breakers — which is exactly the case here.</p>

<hr>
<p>Following the launch of the ASUS ROG Phone 9 FE, the company is dropping its newest Zenfone.</p><p>ASUS has announced the launch of the Zenfone 12 Ultra. At first glance, the latest device looks similar to the company's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-11-ultra-review">11 Ultra</a> from last March. This year, ASUS states that it has "prioritized simplicity, elegance, and beauty." The 12 Ultra has adopted a Zen-aesthetic with softer colors with its available designs. ASUS has also utilized recycled products to craft the phone, like its 22% recycled glass screen and 100% recycled aluminum frame.</p><p>Flipping over to the screen, users get a 6.78-inch FHD Plus screen with a 120Hz refresh rate for standard scrolling/browsing. Consumers can bump this up to 144Hz during gaming to ensure those frames in Honkai: Star Rail or Zenless Zone Zero stay fresh.</p><p>The back of the device features a rectangular camera array, consisting of a 50MP Sony Lytia 500 2x lossless primary lens, a 13MP ultrawide lens, and a 32MP telephoto sensor with "built-in" OIS (optical image stabilization). The punch-hole selfie camera arrives at 32MP with a 90-degree FOV (field of view).</p><p>The Zenfone 12 Ultra utilizes a 6-axis Hybrid Gimbal Stabilizer 4.0, which should aid users with anti-shake and "real-time FOV adjustments."</p>

<p>Performance-wise, the Zenfone 12 Ultra leverages Qualcomm's supercharged <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>. ASUS states this SoC is joined by the Adreno 830 GPU.</p><p>The latest device launch features a healthy array of on-device AI features for potential Zenfone 12 Ultra consumers. The press release states users will find tools like AI Tracking for subject detection in videos, AI Portrait Video 2.0 during 4K recordings for "precision tracking," and AI Voice Clarity.</p><p>Similar to what you'd find on a Google Pixel 9, ASUS has brought in AI Magic Fill, a tool that lets users remove objects from photos. There's also a way to use its generative AI to "perfectly fill the photo." Additionally, AI Unblur comes in to help spruce up those shots that you need to rush to take.</p><p>The phone's 5,500mAh battery with 65W HyperCharge and 15W wireless charging capabilities will help keep users scrolling. Internally, users can purchase the Zenfone 12 Ultra with up to 16GB RAM and up to 512GB of storage.</p><p>ASUS states the Zenfone 12 Ultra is available in three colors: Sage Green, Ebony Black, and Sakura White. Unfortunately, the company has not said when or if this device will arrive in the U.S. For now, folks in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Europe will see this for €1,099 (~$1,143).</p><p>As previously stated, ASUS also just wrapped up the launch of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-9-fe-overseas-launch-details">the ROG Phone 9 FE</a>. Like the flagship <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-9-series-launch">Phone 9 series</a>, the recent FE and the newest Zenfone 12 Ultra all feature similar hardware specs that consumers may enjoy.</p>

Case in point is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a>; it has AptX and AptX HD alongside LDAC and LHDC, but you miss out on AptX Adaptive and AptX Lossless. This isn't an issue most of the time, as an overwhelming majority of earbuds connect via standard AptX or LDAC anyway. <br><br>But if you bought earbuds or a headset that has AptX Lossless and want to get the best possible sound, you'll ideally want to buy a phone that integrates the codec. There's just one issue with that — not many phones have AptX Lossless, and outside of ASUS and select Xiaomi high-end devices, there aren't many choices.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Y2edSGyPV5cq5tHA2UKURj" name="Fiio BT11" alt="Fiio BT11 Bluetooth 5.4 transmitter" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Y2edSGyPV5cq5tHA2UKURj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Thankfully, there's an easier alternative — Fiio's BT11. It is a Bluetooth 5.4 transmitter that you can use with your phone, tablet, PS5, Switch, and any other gaming handheld, and its key differentiator is that it includes all of Qualcomm's high-res codes: AptX, AptX HD, AptX Lossless, AptX Adaptive, and AptX Low Latency.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="4q6Y3ew8WiV6v8uDK6zpKj" name="Fiio BT11" alt="Fiio BT11 Bluetooth 5.4 transmitter" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4q6Y3ew8WiV6v8uDK6zpKj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The BT11 comes with LDAC as well, making it one of the most versatile transmitters you can get today. I've been using it for the better part of two months, and while Fiio had issues with the product at launch — it wouldn't connect easily — those have been ironed out. The transmitter <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005008328307921.html?gatewayAdapt=4itemAdapt">costs $44</a>, and as of writing, it wasn't listed on Amazon.</p>

<p>The BT11 is tiny, and it doesn't take up much room at all. It connects via USB-C, and you can use it with just about any device that uses the standard. You get a USB-C to USB-A dongle in the box if you need to connect it to a Windows machine or older MacBook. <br><br>Before you pair buds to the BT11, you'll need to ensure it is connectable; just plug in the dongle to your phone and launch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fiio.control">Fiio Control</a>. It should detect the BT11 once it's plugged into your phone, and you'll be able to see that it is in pairing mode.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ftrqc9A2QTF6rQwT7mN9Uj" name="Fiio BT11" alt="Fiio BT11 Bluetooth 5.4 transmitter" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ftrqc9A2QTF6rQwT7mN9Uj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Connecting earbuds to the BT11 will sound counter-intuitive, particularly if you're using the transmitter with a phone. Basically, you don't use your phone's Bluetooth to connect to the buds, instead relying on the BT11. But as the transmitter doesn't have an interface to connect, you'll need to follow the flashing LED; it's ready to pair to earbuds when it's alternating between blue and red LEDs, and you then put the buds or headset you want to connect into pairing mode and bring it close to the BT11.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="YEn4izuXUfRMQZkwHgv8Vj" name="Fiio BT11" alt="Fiio BT11 Bluetooth 5.4 transmitter" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YEn4izuXUfRMQZkwHgv8Vj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The buds should connect to the BT11 without any issues, and the transmitter changes color as soon as it pairs. It becomes a solid blue LED when using the standard SBC codec, purple with AptX and AptX Low Latency, yellow with AptX HD, and white if it's using LDAC. I'm testing AptX Adaptive and AptX Lossless, and in this mode, the BT11 switches colors to green.</p>

<p>I didn't see any issues connecting the BT11 with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Honor Magic 7 Pro</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a>, nor did I run into problems pairing a multitude of buds to the device. It is confusing at the start to connect earbuds to the transmitter, but the LEDs on the BT11 act as a visual indicator, and connectivity itself wasn't a hassle — it has Qualcomm's QCC5181 module.</p>

<p>Sound quality is pretty decent, but your mileage will vary based on the music streaming service of choice. I tested it with Apple Music, and it just had too much interference to be usable. Switching to Spotify and YouTube Music sorted out the problems, so if you're using Apple Music on your Android phone, I wouldn't suggest using these until the bugs are ironed out. <br><br>Other than that, there aren't any problems with the BT11. If you have earbuds or a headset that would benefit from AptX Lossless but don't have a source device, the BT11 is a great way to rectify that problem.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>OPPO is slated to launch the Find N5 later this month, and a new leak gives us an indication as to just how thin the device will be. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/yabhishekhd/status/1887011931505955095">Abhishek Yadav on X</a>, the upcoming phone will be just 4.2mm while unfolded, and that's a considerable achievement. <br><br>Honor's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review">Magic V3</a> is my favorite foldable, and the reason I prefer it to its rivals has to do with the weight; it is thinner and lighter than just about anything else in this category. That may change with the introduction of the Find N5, with OPPO clearly intent on outdoing Honor.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Oppo Find N3 versus N5 thickness.Find N3: 5.8mm unfoldFind N5: 4.2mm unfold#oppofindn5 pic.twitter.com/3IxBWX9QlH<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1887011931505955095">February 5, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>While thickness and weight doesn't really matter when using a traditional phone, it absolutely makes a difference with foldables. The defining feature of the Magic V3 is that it feels just like a regular phone when folded, and it removes a lot of the friction that's associated with foldables.</p><p>The Magic V3's 4.4mm thickness when unfolded is only marginally larger than the USB-C port, so for OPPO to go even thinner is a considerable achievement. In fact, teasers shared by the manufacturer back in January show that the device is only a smidgen thicker than the width of the USB-C port.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1029px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.96%;"><img id="CRdG7U4xFCz8o6FfrpKW6m" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5 shown next to iPhone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CRdG7U4xFCz8o6FfrpKW6m.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1029" height="689" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OPPO)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I've generally been a fan of OPPO's foldables, and while I didn't use the Find N3, I tested its global alternative, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-apex-edition-review">OnePlus Open</a>. It's almost a given at this point that the Find N5 will be rebadged in global regions as the Open 2, and U.S. customers should be able to get their hands on the device. Of course, all of this is conjecture on my part — OnePlus hasn't said anything about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-2">Open 2</a> at this moment in time. <br><br>That said, the OnePlus Open 2 should pose a considerable challenge to Samsung in North America should it make its debut in that part of the world. While Honor sells its phones in the U.K. and other western markets, it hasn't reestablished its presence in North America, so there's no reliable way to get the Magic V3 in the region. Having a contender to the Galaxy Z Fold 6 with a significantly thinner design and better cameras has the potential to shake up the status quo, and I can't wait.</p>

<p>Qualcomm opened the 2025 fiscal year with its strongest revenue quarter in the company's history, hitting $11.67 billion primarily on the strength of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> and its "long-standing strategic partnerships with Samsung and Google."</p><p>But the company also warned that the next quarter might be "flat" at best, in part thanks to strong Apple iPhone sales.</p><p>CEO Cristiano Amon headlined Qualcomm's Q1FY25 earnings call, saying that the company's "quarterly revenue records" reflect "the strength of our technology, product roadmap, and end-customer demand."</p><p>A 13% growth in handset revenue came from "stronger consumer demand for recently launched flagship smartphones and global share in Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a> devices," said Qualcomm COO Akash Palkhiwala.</p><p>After touting the success of the Snapdragon 8 Elite, Amon focused on the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/computers-desktops/snapdragon-x-is-finally-coming-to-mini-pcs-lenovo-unveils-new-ideacentre-and-thinkcentre-pcs-to-compete-with-mac-mini">Snapdragon X for mini-desktop PCs</a>, as well as Qualcomm's dominance in the XR space as the primary partner for Meta Quest headsets, Ray-Ban smart glasses, and upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a> headsets like Samsung's Project Moohan.</p>

<p>"We remain optimistic that we are at the beginning of an inflection point for smart glasses to gain scale," Amon said, which lines up with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's comments during his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-q4-2024-earnings">recent earnings call</a> that he hopes to see "hundreds of millions, and eventually <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/zuckerberg-wants-billions-of-ai-glasses-worldwide-is-that-possible">billions of AI glasses</a>."</p><p>Just as Qualcomm saw a 68% automotive profit growth in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-fy-q4-2024-earnings">last quarterly earnings</a>, they saw another 61% boost for this quarter, up to $961 million — while IoT grew 36% to $1.5 billion. Qualcomm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2025/01/qualcomm-and-amazon-announce-technology-collaboration-for-delive">announced</a> an Amazon partnership at CES 2025 to create "LLM-powered experiences in the car," and its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/qualcomm-announces-snapdragon-cockpit-elite-ride-elite-for-ai-in-cars">Snapdragon Cockpit Elite</a> has received a "strong industry reaction," Amon claims.</p><p>Amon predicts the company will earn $22 billion on "non-handset revenue by 2029," compared to about $8 billion total in 2024. This suggests that edge AI and XR business will grow on an exponential scale, making Qualcomm less dependent upon the smartphone business alone.</p><p>Amon explicitly referenced the recent, shocking <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-you-need-to-know-about-deepseek">DeepSeek AI</a> demo as evidence that "AI models are developing faster, becoming smaller, more capable and efficient, and now able to run directly" on Snapdragon-powered tech, with Microsoft bringing "NPU-optimized versions of DeepSeek R1" to Snapdragon X-based Copilot+ PCs.</p>

<p>In the shorter term, Qualcomm's executives warned that Q2FY2025 — or January through March 2025 — will see a "decline in QCT handset revenues" from $10 billion to as low as $8.9 billion. The main cause will be "seasonality and shipments to Apple," which makes its own custom chips.</p><p>Apple recently reported a 4% YoY growth in its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/01/apple-reports-first-quarter-results/">earnings call</a> last week, and is evidently expected to see even stronger <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 series</a> sales next quarter while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> flagship sales may decline.</p><p>At the very least, Qualcomm can continue to make profits despite Arm's efforts to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/arm-is-pulling-the-plug-on-qualcomms-chip-design-license">ban Qualcomm's chips</a> last year. Amon reported that "Arm recently notified us that it was withdrawing its October 22, 2024 notice of breach, and indicated that it has no current plan to terminate the Qualcomm architecture license agreement." If Arm hadn't <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/qualcomm-secures-key-win-against-arm-in-lawsuit-over-custom-snapdragon-chips">lost its recent legal battle</a>, future Qualcomm earnings would have been significantly deflated.</p>

<p>Meta is pouring a ton of resources into AI, but it’s still betting big on the metaverse. The problem is, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/metaverse">metaverse</a> hasn’t really taken off or shown it’s worth the hype yet.</p><p>Meta’s CTO, Andrew Bosworth, says 2025 is the make-or-break year for the metaverse. In a leaked internal memo (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-cto-metaverse-reality-labs-legendary-misadventure-memo-2025-2" target="_blank">Business Insider</a>), he hinted that Reality Labs’ work in mixed reality will either be seen as groundbreaking or a total flop, calling it a potential "legendary misadventure."</p><p>Bosworth adds that Meta is sticking with the metaverse, including Horizon Worlds, through 2025. But after that, Meta needs to see real results and better performance to keep the cash flowing.</p><p>Reality Labs, Meta’s VR arm, has gobbled up tens of billions in funding, but VR still hasn’t hit the mainstream or lived up to its hype. The latest blow came after Reality Labs dropped another $5 billion in losses last quarter, showing just how tough it’s been to turn this ambitious project into a win.</p><p>Bosworth’s take on Horizon Worlds is pretty telling—it’s either going to be a game-changing win or a total faceplant. And honestly, it sounds like he’s leaning more toward the "this could go really wrong" side of things.</p><p>Even with Meta’s deep pockets, there’s only so much cash it can burn—something Bosworth made clear in his memo. He called out the urgent need to boost sales and ramp up engagement, especially in the mixed reality space. He also doubled down on Horizon Worlds needing to crush it on mobile.</p><p>Although 2024 was Reality Labs’ best year yet, Bosworth admits it still hasn’t made a big splash in the real world. He gave a nod to the team being leaner after layoffs and praised the wins with Meta’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Bans</a> and AI projects. But he’s betting on the smaller crew to be quicker, sharper, and more effective.</p>
