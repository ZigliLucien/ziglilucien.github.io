<p>I have had the Magic Laptop Power Bank from Raycon with me for many moons now. Yet somehow, it ended up sitting unused in my pile of gadgets until very recently.</p><p>Raycon is a Bluetooth audio accessory brand primarily, offering a decent range of budget earbuds and headphones. The brand also dabbles in cables and chargers, some of which I have tested before.</p><p>This product claims to be a 5-in-1 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-battery-packs">portable charging solution</a> that can be used to charge laptops as well as wireless charging phones and accessories. Let me preface this hands-on testing by saying that Raycon's charging tech isn't very popular. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/new-raycon-usb-c-cables-are-insanely-cool-and-functional">Their excellent USB-C cables</a> aside, the brand's audio accessory department is what puts them on the map.</p><p>For Raycon to sell the Magic Laptop Power Bank, it needs to provide a very good reason why you shouldn't stick with better, more reputable brands with higher-quality power banks that are also much more powerful. I'm not sure it succeeds here.</p>
<h2 id="how-not-to-sell-a-product-2">How (not) to sell a product</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3BEyLNzKFSJtiZyukyncKB" name="Raycon Magic Laptop Power Bank 5-in-1" alt="Raycon Magic Laptop Power Bank 5-in-1" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3BEyLNzKFSJtiZyukyncKB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As it stands, Raycon failed to effectively advertise the Magic Laptop Power Bank. Here's why.</p><p>Buying a portable power bank isn't the most straightforward process. Once you've figured out what capacity is suitable for your needs, you also have to figure out how many ports you're looking for, whether wireless charging is a priority or not, and how much power you require on the go. There are other factors such as the size and weight of the power bank that matter too.</p><p>So now you know what sort of information a potential customer would actively seek out when looking to purchase a power bank. It was unreasonably challenging for me to glean these details about Raycon's power bank from the online store listing.</p>

<p>The brand's product listing is basically a lesson on how not to sell a power bank, as it doesn't properly highlight or mention most of these details. For example, the Raycon 5-in-1 Magic Power Bank listing doesn't clearly mention the batter's capacity; you have to scroll down to figure this out.</p><p>Also, the power output and input ratings are vague at best. Sure, we know it's a laptop power bank because it's in the name. But what does that mean in terms of rated power?</p><p>A USB-C laptop charges at 60W and above. But since this is a multi-ported power bank, it's essential to know the total power output of the portable battery, which one of the ports supplies that power, and how the power splits when multiple devices are plugged into it at once.</p><p>Most brands like Anker, UGREEN, Baseus, and INIU provide detailed specifications about the ports on their charging tech as well as power distribution charts that showcase what charging speed the combined use of all the ports delivers.</p>

<p>The build quality isn't great either, the built-in cable feels very cheap, and the charging speeds are nothing to write home about. The USB-C ports support a 65W power output, but the USB-A port can only do a measly 18W, and the input is limited to an abysmal 30W with the prongs. If you need speedy recharging, the USB-C port supports 45W PD input.</p><p>Not only are exact charging speeds missing from the conversation, but the size and weight are also omitted. The only place you can even learn of this info is from the quick start guide inside the box. Why would you buy a product and <em>then</em> find out its exact specs?</p><p>But do you know what the website <em>does</em> advertise? A built-in stand for phones. However, the review sample Raycon sent me doesn't even have one.</p><p>I'm not happy with the quality of the Raycon Magic Laptop Power Bank 5-in-1 or the way it skips key details when trying to convince people that it's a worthwhile buy.</p><p>Based on this I'm going to deduce that you, the reader, are not going to waste your time on Raycon's power bank. And I can't fault you with that, because there are so many better options out there.</p>
<h2 id="don-t-waste-your-time-2">Don't waste your time...</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Av7YKNGBr5dczcVZUStACB" name="Raycon Magic Laptop Power Bank 5-in-1" alt="Raycon Magic Laptop Power Bank 5-in-1" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Av7YKNGBr5dczcVZUStACB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>All that doesn't even factor in the price, which is usually steep for high-quality power banks and battery packs.</p><p>Cheaping out is the worst thing you could do with charging tech because it's quite literally a potential safety risk. There's a good reason why airlines have such tight regulations around power banks. This is why most folks don't mind spending a little more on a solid portable power bank anyway.</p><p>Raycon's power bank is relatively cheaper, but it's very chunky and hefty for a 15,000mAh battery pack. You can easily score a GaN power bank that's more compact for the same amount of money and with better technical specifications.</p><p>On top of that, the current market for portable batteries, power banks, and hybrid chargers is insanely diverse. It's not difficult to find the right battery catered towards any individual for a decent price. Anker and UGREEN alone make enough power bank models to satisfy anybody out there, with a wide mix of ports, capacity, and power.</p><p>I don't recommend the Raycon Magic Laptop Power Bank 5-in-1 at the end of the day. Why buy this when there are scores of fantastic, higher-quality options out there that disclose a lot more information?</p>

<hr>
<p>Intel Unison, a free Windows app that connects <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> and tablets to PCs, is shutting down in just a few months. Users were notified of the impending shutdown this week on the Windows version of the app, and the Microsoft Store listing for Intel Unison was updated as well. By June 30, 2025, the app will be discontinued (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.neowin.net/news/intel-is-killing-an-awesome-free-windows-11-app-that-connects-pcs-with-phones/" target="_blank">Neowin</a>).</p><p>"Intel Unison will soon be discontinued," the Microsoft Store <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9pp9gzm2gn26?hl=en-US&gl=US" target="_blank">listing</a> explains. "The first step in its wind-down process is ending service for most platforms at the end of June 2025. Lenovo Aura platforms will retain service through 2025."</p><p>Intel Unison offers a slew of features to make seamlessly connecting your Android devices to your Windows PCs. For <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablets</a>, Intel Unison enables wireless external display connection. It also makes it possible to make calls and send texts from your Windows PC using your Android phone. On top of that, you can drag-and-drop files and photos between devices.</p><p>While some of these features are available using the Microsoft Phone Link app, many viewed the Intel Unison app as a more robust experience with additional capabilities. Of course, all of those features will be discontinued by Intel by the end of June.</p>

<ul><li>OnePlus is preparing to launch a tiny OnePlus 13 model in China later this month.</li><li>The OnePlus 13T will sport a 6.3-inch display and pack a large battery.</li><li>In a Weibo post, OnePlus' head of China revealed that battery life was a focus point of OnePlus 13T development.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>OnePlus is gearing up to release a smaller version of the OnePlus 13, and this week has been full of teasers. The company first revealed that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-teases-its-upcoming-13t-as-a-part-of-an-april-fools-prank">the OnePlus 13T would launch this month in China</a> in an April Fool's Day gag. Now, President of OnePlus China Louis Lee took to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/status/5150921408644564" target="_blank">Weibo</a> to share more about the upcoming "mini" OnePlus flagship.</p><p>First, Lee said the development of the OnePlus 13T began with a small goal. OnePlus wanted to dispel the notion that small handsets can't have large battery. This "small goal" underscores the company's larger goal in designing a smaller version of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> — which Lee describes as to "make users who want to buy small-screen mobile phones but still have concerns more assured."</p><p>With a rumored 6.3-inch display, the OnePlus 13T would be miniature by OnePlus' standards, but regularly-sized by 2025 standards overall. It's tipped, but unconfirmed, that the OnePlus 13T could have a battery capacity in excess of 6,000mAh despite its small form factor.</p>

<p>This time, we have also made great efforts in terms of battery and endurance. It will be equipped with a new generation of glacier batteries," Lee writes in the post, translated to English. "[The] OnePlus 13T will be the small-screen mobile phone with the largest battery capacity and the best battery life in history. The proper small-screen battery life is the king!"</p><p>Other leaks surfaced the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/the-oneplus-13t-just-inched-closer-to-launch-with-fresh-details-surfacing">OnePlus 13T in a regulatory filing</a>, referred to as PKX110, revealing that the device will come with 80W fast charging. It's also expected to be powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite </a>chipset and include a 50MP main camera sensor.</p><p>When it launches later this month, the OnePlus 13T will be the first "T-branded" device from the China phone-maker in three years. The last one was the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-10t-review"> OnePlus 10T</a>, which released in 2022.</p>

<hr>
<p>On Wednesday (April 2) we <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-delays-galaxy-s25-edge-release-from-april-to-may-or-june-2025" target="_blank">reported</a> that Samsung is allegedly delaying the launch of the Galaxy S25 Edge. Early reports indicated that the phone would launch around the second week of April. However, yesterday, we heard some murmur that the company will now launch the device in May or June.</p><p>While we speculated several reasons for the Korean OEM's decision, we finally seem to have some answers. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,150033.html" target="_blank">WinFuture</a>, sources close to Samsung told them that the launch of the Galaxy S25 Edge was postponed "at the last minute." The company said that they were dealing with some "technical issues with the device, which made further testing necessary."</p><p>Backing the publication's claims is German tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MaxJmb/status/1907320951802315009" target="_blank">Max Jambor</a>. In his X post, he added that while people are eagerly awaiting its launch, Samsung continues to "fine-tune" the Galaxy S25 Edge behind the scenes. "While the device won't launch on April 15, it will still see the light of day somewhere in Q2 this year," Jambor said.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3119px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="9fo8EsBntiCcnYkLJPARyh" name="samsung-unpacked-galaxy-s25-edge-parts-teaser" alt="Components for the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge on stage at Samsung Unpacked 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9fo8EsBntiCcnYkLJPARyh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3119" height="1755" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While these could be valid reasons for the Korean OEM to steer clear from launching a new phone,  the German website feels that there could be external factors at play.</p><p>For starters, the site states that Samsung wants to avoid a lack of public interest due to the tense political situation in its home country, South Korea. The company could be stalling the release "because the previous head of the mobile device division, Noh Tae-moon, recently suffered a heart attack and passed away at the age of just 64," the website added.</p><p>Whatever the reason behind the delay, the Galaxy S25 Edge has been one of Samsung's most anticipated phones yet, as it has been hyping the device since the start of 2025. While the company did not confirm the April 15 launch, several sources supported this claim. However, Samsung reportedly sent news of the delay to certain telecom operators in Korea, who were all set to sell this device in April.</p>

<p>As for when to expect the launch of the Samsung S25 Edge; a recent report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-may-2025-launch-date/">SamMobile</a> indicates that the company is pushing its launch date just by a month and sources told the publication that the slim phone will be unveiled on May 13.</p><p>"The South Korean company will launch the S25 Edge in a smaller online-only presentation, though this could vary by country," the publication added.</p><p>In terms of spec, the Galaxy S25 Edge is said to be 5.84mm thin, showcasing a titanium body and an Armor Aluminum frame. The phone could have a 6.7-inch QHD+ dynamic AMOLED display powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset</a>.</p><p>The phone is supposed to launch in three colors that match the Galaxy S25 Ultra: "Titanium Jet Black," "Titanium Silver," and "Titanium Icy Blue."  The Galaxy S25 Edge will have two rear cameras stacked vertically: a primary 200MP lens and a 12MP lens for ultra-wide shots, along with a selfie camera, which we don't have much information about. We also hear that the 256GB model will cost around €1,200–€1,300 ($1,300–$1,400), while the 512GB version might hit €1,300–€1,400 ($1,400–$1,520).</p><p>Lastly, WinFuture indicated that Samsung could soon release a video teasing the Galaxy S25 Edge, considering it could launch in the next two months.</p>

That means Android 16 has already achieved platform stability with the Beta 3 update, although it still isn't perfect. Any Google Pixel 6 or newer smartphone can test out the Android 16 beta by participating in the Android Beta Program, but what if you want out?</p><p>Luckily, it's possible to opt out of the Android Beta Program and uninstall the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16 beta</a> if you have second thoughts. There are easy methods that completely erase your phone and one way to keep your data that requires a bit of patience. Let's dive in.</p>
<h2 id="all-the-ways-you-can-uninstall-the-android-16-beta-2">All the ways you can uninstall the Android 16 beta</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="DsBa2t3vEyHabPemsFwwK8" name="android-15-21.jpg" alt="Android 15 home page on Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro XL, and Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DsBa2t3vEyHabPemsFwwK8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We always recommend users back up their device before <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-install-android-beta">installing the Android 16 beta</a>, and there's a key reason for that — it's very inconvenient to uninstall the beta without erasing your data. The only way to uninstall the Android 16 beta is to wait for its official public release; all other methods require completely erasing your device. There are three options available:</p>
<ul><li>Opt out of the Android Beta Program and wait for an over-the-air (OTA) update that erases your device, reverting it to the latest stable version.</li><li>Opt out of the Android Beta Program and wait for the stable version of the update you're testing, which will be sent as an over-the-air (OTA) update — <strong>this option can take up to three to four months</strong>.</li><li>Install a stable version of Android using the <a href="https://flash.android.com/" target="_blank">Android Flash Tool</a> or ADB — <strong>this involves sideloading, will erase ALL of your data, and is only recommended for advanced users</strong>.</li></ul>
<p>For most users, we recommend using the first method to opt out of the Android Beta Program an applying the OTA update. It will delete all the data on your phone, but this can be restored from an older device backup.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-opt-out-of-the-android-beta-program-2">How to opt out of the Android Beta Program</h2>
<p>Before you can receive an OTA update with a stable version of Android, you'll need to opt out of the Android Beta Program on the web. Here's how to do it:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Open the Android Beta Program site's Devices tab</strong> (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/android/beta#devices" target="_blank">direct link</a>). Make sure you are logged into the same Google account as your Pixel phone.</p><p>2. <strong>Find the device</strong> you want to unenroll from the Android Beta Program, and click <strong>Opt out</strong>.</p>

<p>3. After reading the disclaimer, <strong>click Leave beta</strong>.</p>

<p>After opting out of the Android 16 beta on the web, you can return to a stable version of Android 15 by installing the OTA update sent to your device. This could take 24 hours to appear, and <strong>will delete your data</strong>.</p><p>If you didn't back up your device prior to installing the Android 16 beta, you <strong>should not</strong> install the update sent to your device within a day. Instead, you should wait for the stable version of the update to arrive. For example, if you are testing the Android 16 beta, you should wait for the first official Android 16 update in order to keep your data intact.</p><p>When you are ready to install the OTA update — either the rollback update or the official stable release — you'll need to follow these steps:</p>
<p>1. Open the <strong>Settings app</strong> on your Pixel phone.</p><p>2. Navigate to <strong>System</strong> > <strong>Software update</strong> > <strong>System update</strong>.</p><p>3. You may need to tap <strong>Check for update</strong> to find the latest OTA update.</p><p>4. When the update appears, follow the on-screen prompts to <strong>download and install it</strong>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RWhyinmyBsuHJonKCVdatY" name="Pixel-Install-Stable-Android-Version" alt="Checking for an update on a Pixel phone." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RWhyinmyBsuHJonKCVdatY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It may take a while for the update to be download and optimized for your device. Make sure your device is charged, or connected to power, to complete the update. Your phone might restart multiple times throughout this process, but when it is all said and done, you'll be running a stable version of Android 15.</p>

<p>There are many good reasons to uninstall the latest Android 16 beta, but they usually come to one key issue: bugs. Since the Android Beta Program entirely consists of pre-release software, it is riddled with bugs and issues. Even platform-stable updates, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-beta-3-launch">Android 16 Beta 3</a>, are going to have problems you wouldn't face on a public version of Android — evidenced by the fact <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-rolls-out-android-16-beta-3-1-patch-with-crucial-bug-fixes">Google released Android 16 Beta 3.1</a> to fix some of those very bugs.</p><p>If you've had enough of the instability or simply want to patiently wait for the public version of Android 16, there's always the option to uninstall the beta using these methods.</p>

<p>Google Pixel 10 leaks have been popping up quite often since the past week. What started as full-blown <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-series-render-leak-reveal-identical-design">CAD renders </a>of the device has turned into significant spec leaks. We heard some chatter that the standard model finally getting a tri-camera setup with an added telephoto lens, joining the other two devices in the lineup.</p><p>Now the most recent leak comes from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/exclusive-pixel-10-camera-details-3540182/">Android Authority,</a> as the publication claims that it was able to view internal documents that reveal major camera changes chalked out for the Google Pixel 10 series.</p>

<p>According to an inside source, Google will finally shake things up with its standard flagship model this year, at least with its camera.</p><p>Usually, the base models come with a wide and ultrawide lens. However, this time, it might get a third telephoto lens, and the tech giant is allegedly going to downgrade the whole camera setup to accommodate the new lens, so much so that these leaked specs reveal it being closer to the budget <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-hands-on">Pixel 9a</a>.</p><p>The primary sensor on the Pixel 10 will allegedly be replaced by a Samsung GN8, a smaller one than the GNV sensor used in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a>.</p><p>"Similarly, the ultrawide lens has been downgraded to a Sony IMX712 from the previous IMX858," the publication states, noting that it will have a lower 13MP lens. It's seemingly a downgrade from last year's 48MP ultrawide camera. The publication adds that the new telephoto lens will get an 11MP resolution and Samsung 3J1 sensor, similar to the one on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>.</p><p>At the same time, the specs for the front-facing camera remain unchanged (11 MP).</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1536px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rNDVh9bKGPJxkMYx2CfFBm" name="Pixel-10-camera-spec-leak" alt="Infographic showing alleged camera specs of the Pixel 10 series" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rNDVh9bKGPJxkMYx2CfFBm.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1536" height="864" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While megapixels really don't dictate the quality of the image, the camera sensors do. And if this leak holds true, then the tech giant seems to be compromising on image quality to get an additional lens into the standard model.</p><p>While post-shoot edits and Google's computational photography will help improve image quality, a smaller sensor only makes shooting in low-light conditions even tougher. And seeing the specs of a budget model show up in a flagship device is certainly disappointing.</p><p>Rumors suggest that the Google Pixel 10 Pro and the Pro XL will keep last year's camera specs. However, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold could see a minor change with its primary lens. "The primary Sony IMX787 (used in the Pixel 8a) will be replaced with the Samsung GN8 (used in the Pixel 9a)," the publication added.</p><p>That said, we know that all three phones will supposedly be retaining their designs as their predecessors, and will be powered by Google's new Tensor G5 SoC chip. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-alleged-porcelain-renderings-leaked">another leak indicated</a> that the Pixel 10 Pro Fold could be offered at a "lower price point" compared to last year, and will be powered by the Tensor G5 as well.</p><p>Lastly, these leaks should be taken with a grain of salt as there's no confirmation that these specs will show up in the actual device.

Like any good kids sleepover party, this one involved a lot of video games. Everyone had gotten a Meta Quest 3S for Christmas and they couldn't wait to play while everyone was in the same house.</p>

<p>Except they never got to play because of one bug or another. One headset lost tracking and refused to allow us to work unless it was in travel mode — something that doesn't work when you're trying to play a game like Dungeons of Eternity since it restricts movement. One of the other headsets refused to populate the friends list, making it impossible for them to join a game together. After an hour of troubleshooting, they all went back to their trusty Nintendo Switches for the rest of the night.</p><p>One boy, who had just upgraded from a Quest 1 to a Quest 3S, told me that he had never had problems like this with his first Quest, and he didn't understand how Meta could make a newer product worse than an old one. While I understood the technical reasons for the problems he was experiencing — mostly problems caused by the extremely buggy v74 update — they couldn't change the frustration he felt at the process.</p><p>The issue lies entirely in Meta's seeming inability to conduct a proper QA process for its regular system updates. The company is too focused on shipping new features regularly than being concerned with delivering bug-free updates. In many ways, it reminds me a lot of the Google Pixel series of phones, which have suffered from the same type of problem since the Pixel 6, and it's time Meta starts prioritizing stability over capability.</p>

<p>This year has been terrible for Meta Quest updates. There's no mincing words. Back in December, just as folks were unboxing their brand new Meta Quest 3S headsets, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-v72-bad-christmas-update">a bad update to firmware V72</a> began bricking devices. The company acknowledged the bad update within a few days but did a poor job communicating the issue to its customer service team.</p><p>That meant that not only could people <em>not use</em> the headset they just received as a gift, but some customers had to fight tooth and nail to get a warranty replacement in the first place. It wasn't a good first impression for new Meta Quest owners.</p><p>Not two months later, the V74 update rolled out, bringing amazing new features that could <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-v74-feature-is-set-to-revolutionize-immersive-experiences">soon revolutionize immersive experiences</a>. Except that the feature shipped with serious experience-breaking bugs. As evidenced in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://communityforums.atmeta.com/t5/Announcements/PTC-v74-Release-Thread/ba-p/1288416">official V74 testing thread</a> on Meta's community forums, <strong>a lot</strong> of people found the update to be less than satisfactory.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Meta is too focused on shipping new features regularly than being concerned with delivering bug-free updates, and that's a huge problem.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>One Meta Quest V74 bug keeps the headset from charging fully, stopping at 74% for some unknown reason. Players noticed that severe network lag all of a sudden caused PC VR games to be unplayable. Secondary accounts on the headset wouldn't load games at all, and even after a "fix," there are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://communityforums.atmeta.com/t5/Get-Help/PTC-v76-serious-secondary-account-issues/m-p/1309030">still severe issues</a> trying to play games on non-primary headset accounts.</p><p>A new bug causes the UI to randomly disappear when waking the device from sleep. Despite being flagged during the two-month testing phase, it was never fixed before V74 was released to the public. I could go on with several more examples, but you get the point: Meta Quest firmware updates are buggy, and they're causing people to get fed up with their headsets.</p><p>This doesn't exactly look good for a company that is actively fighting to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/gdc-2025-oculus-publishing-head-challenges-meta-criticism-on-quest-store-profitability">protect its image</a> among VR enthusiasts while developers face <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/quest-developers-are-joining-forces-to-solve-the-vr-visibility-crisis">a very real visibility crisis</a>.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Meta Quest gamers expect to put their headset on and play the game they want. They don't want to be bothered with troubleshooting or tinkering.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>While it's true that Meta has been working hard to outplay potential competitors in the space with rapid feature evolution, the company isn't doing a great job of ensuring that existing users have a good experience. Mainly, that means having a <em>stable</em> experience.</p><p>One of the main reasons I stopped playing PC VR games years ago was because I was tired of the troubleshooting. Oftentimes, I would spend more time troubleshooting why a game wasn't working than I would actually playing the game. I went so far as to sell my PC last year and replace it with a Steam Deck so I could still play PC games without all the driver hassles and tinkering. I just want things to work, and that's why I play VR games on a Meta Quest.</p><p>Meta needs to remember that this is a gaming console. Like a Nintendo Switch 2, a PlayStation 5, or an Xbox Series X, Meta Quest gamers expect to put their headset on and play the game they want. They don't want to be bothered with troubleshooting or tinkering. That nonsense is for the PC players who enjoy graphical fidelity at the expense of tweaking and tinkering.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>It's time for Meta to slow its update schedule down and ensure that updates are something people look forward to rather than fear.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>As Meta moves forward with Meta Quest update V76, it's time the company starts taking stability more seriously and letting new features take a back seat to a quality experience. That means the company needs to start <strong>fixing bugs</strong> before releasing new firmware to the public. If a major bug still persists, a firmware update should be delayed until said bug has been squashed.</p><p>But as I've said, Google is just as guilty of this sin as Meta. Whether it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-6-devices-android-15-bricking-reports">phone-breaking Android updates</a>, weird <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-owners-report-march-security-patch-problems">storage and display issues</a>, or even something as inconvenient as your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-users-late-start-alarm-issues-reported">morning alarm not sounding</a>, Google's phones often feel more like a testbed than a stable platform.</p><p>Any human-made piece of software is going to have problems or bugs that need squashing, but a regimen of monthly updates isn't what the doctor ordered for a stable computing platform. Rather, companies like Meta need to slow things down a bit and ensure that updates are something people look forward to rather than fear.</p><p>When users are constantly looking for ways to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-flash-tool-downgrade-pixel-firmware">roll back software updates</a>, you know you've got a problem.</p><p>As the Meta Quest platform gains traction and becomes more mainstream, Meta must keep buggy updates away from its headsets. VR gaming already has enough friction without bugs and problems as it is without these silly, needless problems being added to it.</p>

<hr>
<p>Nothing has unveiled new devices for its flagship brand, but its more affordable sub-unit is just getting started with teasers.</p><p>Early today (Apr. 3), CMF by Nothing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/cmfbynothing/status/1907719990662340998">posted a teaser</a> for an upcoming device with a quick video that indicates one its core upgrades (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2025/04/03/nothing-shares-first-teaser-for-cmf-phone-2/">Gizmochina</a>). The short video seemingly shows off a singular camera lens on the back of an orange CMF Phone. The clip showcases the device with deep technological ridges and cuts. It's unclear if these could be real features on the phone's rear panel or just for visual effect.</p><p>Additionally, CMF by Nothing adds the tagline, "In search of the perfect shot," and finishes with "coming soon."</p><p>The publication also highlighted a recent discovery of a Nothing member's post of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2025/03/29/nothing-teases-4-new-devices/">several Pokemon</a>. It's been assumed that the Pokemon symbolizes the codenames for upcoming devices from the CMF sub-brand. Bulbasaur reportedly concerns the CMF Phone 2, while the remaining three Pokemon could indicate new wearables and earbuds from the affordable brand.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">In search of the perfect shot.Coming soon. pic.twitter.com/tEbBVUB6UX<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1907719990662340998">April 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Showing a singular lens for this (ideally) second CMF Phone might seem odd when you remember <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/cmf-phone-1-review">the first model</a> had a dual array. However, images for a set of alleged CMF Phone 2 prototypes appeared <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NOTHING/comments/1jezu35/cmf_phone_2_and_i_think_its_compact/#lightbox">on Reddit</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/new-nothing-cmf-phone-2-leak-suggests-it-might-be-a-samsung-galaxy-a26-killer_id168658">Phone Arena</a>). The photos showcase the device in black, but the takeaway is that it sports a triple-camera array. The device is showcased with the vertical dual array that we've seen previously, but that third lens is off to the side with its LED flash right beneath it.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NOTHING/comments/1jezu35/cmf_phone_2_and_i_think_its_compact">Cmf phone 2 and i think its compact</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NOTHING">r/NOTHING</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>The tipster on Reddit claims the phone is "compact." Unfortunately, the specifics of this extra lens weren't stated. The CMF Phone 1 delivered a 50MP main lens with EIS and a 2x zoom, portrait mode only lens.</p><p>We've had the idea of a "CMF Phone 2" in the back of our minds <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-future-trio-specs-database-leak">since rumors about it</a> surfaced in December. The device was reportedly discovered within the IMEI database alongside Nothing's Phone 3a and 3a Plus. While the former <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/heres-what-i-want-from-nothing-phone-3-after-using-phone-3a-pro">have already launched</a>, the CMF Phone 2 supposedly holds model number A001 internally.</p><p>Little else about the device was discovered a few months ago, but if CMF by Nothing is teasing it, there's a chance launch isn't far away.</p>

And for now, that's probably the best we can hope for to make smart rings longer-lasting. But there's a more fundamental fix — patented by Oura, unsurprisingly — that I think Samsung needs to consider for the Galaxy Ring's future.</p><p>According to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring/samsung-galaxy-ring-2-dream-batteries-rumored">report</a>, Samsung is considering using solid electrolytes instead of a traditional lithium-ion battery, increasing the energy density from 200 to 360Wh/L and offering greater flexibility that would be perfect for this rounded form factor.</p><p>The Galaxy Ring 2 could be the "first case" of Samsung using this tech, followed by the Galaxy Buds and Watch in later years. However, the report stresses that this battery tech is quite expensive; the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Galaxy Ring</a> is already costlier than most smart rings at $399, and this battery could push the Ring 2 over the edge of what most people will pay.</p><p>But let's ignore cost and say that Samsung can increase its Ring's battery efficiency. Its <em>capacity</em> will still be limited by physics and thermals, and the lack of smart ring repairability means any battery problem will be fatal. That is unless <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">smart rings</a> start to become more modular.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem-with-smart-rings-2">The problem with smart rings</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="3sGWcko3E7aG2PnDTK5TxW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Ring-battery-life-01.jpg" alt="The gold Samsung Galaxy Ring alongside the Samsung Wearables app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3sGWcko3E7aG2PnDTK5TxW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ultrahuman is one of the few smart ring brands to speak openly about battery health. On its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ultrahuman.com/ring/faq/">FAQ page</a>, it promises that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-review">Ultrahuman Ring Air</a> lasts 500 charging cycles "before there is any significant decline in battery performance," but that "a gradual reduction in battery life can be expected after 1 to 2 years" and wouldn't be covered by the warranty.</p><p>Even if other brands don't say it outright, smart rings are especially susceptible to battery issues. Most can only squeeze in about 20–30mAh of capacity while keeping the design skinny. They're optimized at the start to go a week on minimal capacity, but <em>any</em> loss of capacity will have an outsized effect over time. You'll probably notice the same issue with wireless earbuds.</p><p>Let's make an unscientific guess that Samsung's dream battery increases the Galaxy Ring 2 capacity to 50mAh, or even 100mAh. That's still on a scale well below a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a> (300–425mAh) or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a> (4,000–5,000mAh), with natural drain after a couple of years but with capacity to spare.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="YfqvMSCCxKbLw7zSnUdfPb" name="Ultrahuman-Ring-Air-showing-logo.jpeg" alt="The Ultrahuman Ring Air held in fingertips to show the Ultrahuman logo engraved inside." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YfqvMSCCxKbLw7zSnUdfPb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>More importantly, your Galaxy watch or phone is repairable; you can <em>replace</em> a deficient battery.</p><p>That wouldn't apply to Samsung's curved electrode battery, shoved into a dense, complex design. Generally speaking, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smart-rings-are-disposable-tech">smart rings are disposable tech</a> because once they're constructed, you can't take them apart and put them back together again. This lack of repairability hurts consumers <em>and</em> manufacturers.</p><p>After I reviewed the Ultrahuman Ring Air, my fiancee decided to buy one and loved it. But after 3 months, it suddenly died, refusing to charge or reconnect to her phone.</p><p>Because it fell under warranty, Ultrahuman had to mail her a brand new one. It couldn't be repaired and sent back or refurbished for a new sale. It might not even be able to figure out what went wrong with it or if it was her fault (it wasn't). It just has to keep making new rings and throwing out the old ones — which must be expensive, depending on the failure rate.</p>
<h2 id="the-real-smart-ring-battery-solution-2">The real smart ring battery solution</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="BeCuwuZWt7RVvEXLSFfmU4" name="oura-ring-patent-module-1" alt="A patent figure showing a smart ring with a pre-designed cavity that an attachable module could slot into." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BeCuwuZWt7RVvEXLSFfmU4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: UPSTO / Oura Health Oy)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When researching the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-5">Oura Ring 5</a>, I discovered a ton of cool patents for redesigning its ring, mostly to make it one-size-fits-all. But I was most intrigued by patent US-12177997-B2, "Functional cover with wireless connection for ring wearable." As the patent figure above shows, the ring could have a removable module that slides into a predesigned cavity.</p><p>Why design it this way? For one thing, the battery is "frequently the module in a device that declines in performance most quickly," so when it fails, "a user may be forced to upgrade to a newer module...even though the previous wearable device otherwise operated as intended."</p><p>With Oura's design, the ring top would be removable, so users could slot in a new battery module, or slot in modules designed for other purposes like fitness tracking, contactless payments, location tracking, and so on.</p><p>Thus, buying a replacement module would be less expensive than buying a new ring, and you could hypothetically own two battery modules and swap between them when one dies, so you never have to take the ring off.</p>

<p>I have no idea how easy this would be to implement or if such a module would blend in as a normal-looking ring top. Oura has other patents it could use instead, like US-20240385649-A1 — "Wearable Ring Device with Battery in Cover" — that focuses instead on squeezing a thin, 360º battery layer into the cover so that it doesn't interfere with the internal components.</p><p>It's not about what Oura ends up doing; it's that Oura evidently knows that the status quo — short-lived rings you can't repair or improve over time — hurts them with consumers who don't want to spend $300–400 every two or three years on a new ring. And it's looking for solutions.</p><p>Samsung's solid-state battery is an intriguing solution, too! But it's a stop-gap measure. In theory, it'll build up the Galaxy Ring 2 battery life so much that even when it loses capacity, it'll still last long enough to avoid daily charges. But it's still a battery shoved into a device you can't open without breaking it.</p><p>So long as smart rings cannot be repaired or refurbished, consumers will hesitate to buy one after another, not knowing how long they'll last.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung was spotted publishing a patent for its smart ring that involves quite a unique charging method.</p><p>A post by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-ring-could-use-a-novel-way-to-charge/">SamMobile</a> highlights this new patent in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2025063477">WIPO</a>, which explains the idea of charging your Galaxy Ring with your Galaxy phone. The patent in question explores the possibility of slotting the device into a circular opening on the back of a Galaxy phone. Samsung's title for the patent is "Electronic Device Comprising Seating Structure."</p><p>The Korean OEM provided a quick sketch of the theorized product, which shows a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-hands-on">Galaxy Ring</a> around a circular peg, similar to the device's current charging method in its case. The sketch doesn't explain if the Ring would be flush to the phone's back or if it would stick out a little while it's charging.</p><p>The illustration previews what the internal components would look like, which hold the pins for the electrical charge.</p><p>The publication spotted a few more details in the full abstract, such as Samsung's idea of bringing this method to foldables, as well as "certain cases." Elsewhere, it noticed the company mention the possibility for the Galaxy Ring to upload "health and fitness data" when slotted for charging.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:389px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:154.24%;"><img id="FmQqRAvQBEkJXopHWYR7G4" name="samsung-galaxy-ring-galaxy-phone-slotted-charging-patent" alt="Samsung recently published a patent that shows a Galaxy Ring charging method within a Galaxy phone." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FmQqRAvQBEkJXopHWYR7G4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="389" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WIPO)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's probably no surprise that the existence of a patent means nothing without official company statements. There's a chance we might never see this idea, especially when you consider Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-is-working-on-a-thin-galaxy-z-fold-phone-with-s-pen-support">recent trend of thin phones</a>. It's even been rumored to remove the S Pen digitizer from its next Galaxy Z Fold for the sake of making it thinner — and the stylus was able to charge from within, too.</p><p>We've seen unique (and cool) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-resizing-patent-discovered">Galaxy Ring patents before</a>, like one from October that showed elastic internals that could alter its size to fit your finger. Samsung published that new patent last fall in South Korea with illustrations of a smart ring with a "resizing structure." The company also described it as "transformable," depending on the person. The patent explained three resizing structures for its rings with three, four, and eight internal segments.</p><p>Those segments would enable more or less "resizing" for your finger.</p><p>It's a neat idea, but there's nothing actionable to make this feel real amid rising interests in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-2">Galaxy Ring 2</a>. There <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-ring-2-new-enhancements-launch-rumored">were rumors</a> that the Korean OEM could reveal this next device "earlier" with an increased battery life and a thinner build. Additionally, a more recent report from South Korea claims Samsung is looking to implement "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring/samsung-galaxy-ring-2-dream-batteries-rumored">dream batteries</a>," more commonly known as "all-solid-state batteries," in the Ring 2, which could give it a battery capacity boost.</p>

<ul><li>Android 16 Beta 3.2 fixes haptic feedback calibration, excessive battery drain, and screen flickering issues on some Pixel devices.</li><li>The update is available for beta testers using Pixel 6 and above, with OTA updates expected within 24 hours of release.</li><li>It appears Google is refining things before the stable Android 16 release.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has started rolling out yet another beta for its latest Android 16 operating system. The new incremental update comes right after two weeks when the Android 16 Beta 3.1 was rolled out for Pixel phones.</p><p>The latest Android 16 Beta 3.2 update, bearing <strong>BP22.250221.015</strong> version, includes a bunch of fixes, including for devices like Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. The fixes with the latest firmware include an issue that caused haptic feedback to be miscalibrated in some cases. An issue causing excessive battery drain on some Pixel phones even when they weren't in use seems to have been fixed as well.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1jpyjyy/android_16_beta_32_now_available">Android 16 Beta 3.2 now available!</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta">r/android_beta</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>Talking about the Pixel 6 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-6-pro-review">Pixel 6 Pro</a>, this update is fixing an issue of screen flickers while shooting pictures or videos on their devices. Additionally, other issues, which seem to have been impacting system stability and usability, have also been addressed with the latest beta 3.2 update.</p><p>For those unaware, the latest Android 16 Beta 3.2 is available for beta testers using Pixel 6 and above. They are likely to receive the Over the Air (OTA) update within the first 24 hours of the release, which was initially announced on April 2. Users can navigate to Settings> System> System updates on their aforementioned Pixel owners, provided they are already enrolled in the beta program.</p>

<p>It appears Google is cleaning things up for Android 16  stable release with incremental updates rolling out. As mentioned, the search giant <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-rolls-out-android-16-beta-3-1-patch-with-crucial-bug-fixes">rolled out beta 3.1</a> update in March, which also didn't include any new features but rather only included bug fixes.</p><p>Some of the notable ones comprised brightness levels fluctuating issues and some of the Pixel phones experienced Settings app crashes, which were also addressed in the same beta update.</p><p>On the other hand, Google is also gearing up for its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-io-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">IO event</a>, which is scheduled for May 20 and is taking place at Shoreline Amphitheatre, Mountain View, California. We expect to see more of Android 16 alongside Google's AI innovations at the event.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google recently highlighted a brand new iteration of its Photos app integration with its  AI model, Gemini.</p><p>As Google upgrades the Gemini mobile app, a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/15734842">support document</a> states that users can "search for a specific memory or recall information" from their gallery. Users can do so in a variety of ways, beginning with Google's Photos app prompts. The document highlights the ability for users to use natural language with specifics about themes and past events.</p><p>Using the @Google Photos (or "my photos" alternatively) tag, the company gives the following example: "What themes have we had for Lena’s birthday parties?" Additionally, you can say something like, "What are the top 10 things we saw on our last trip?"</p><p>Specifically, the document states users can " ask for photos" and "ask about them." Users can find specific faces and relationships in photos stored in their gallery. The Photos app integration in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> will also accept questions about locations and the dates a picture was taken. Moreover, users can attempt to describe the photo they're looking for and have Gemini take care of the rest.</p><p>Once Gemini discovers what you're looking for, Google says users can tap the picture in the AI's app, which will open it fully in the Photos app. Similarly, if the AI surfaced an entire album for you, interacting with it will open its entirety in Photos. Google adds that Android phones and tablets can "Drag and drop a photo from the Gemini on-screen overlay into another app."</p>

<p>These new Gemini and Photos app abilities are arriving in the model's Android app (tablets included); however, it's only for a "selected group of invited users." Google warns that not everyone will receive early access. Your prompts must be in English for this test. Elsewhere, if you do have access, you must ensure you're signed into Gemini with the same Google account as Photos.</p><p>Google will also give you the chance to connect your Photos content with Gemini when the time comes.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bEw7CvzDGqVtDPJUbU4f2Z" name="google-gemini-huge-updates-flash-thinking-hero" alt="Google detailed huge updates for the Gemini app for all users." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bEw7CvzDGqVtDPJUbU4f2Z.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2096" height="1179" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On the surface, what the company is highlighting seems extremely similar to its "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-photos-gemini-powered-early-access-waitlist">Ask Photos</a>" test currently in early access via Labs. In fact, Google directly mentions this in its recent support document, stating users can try and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/photos/answer/15318661">opt-in</a>. Early Access in Labs kicked off in September with Google's confidence that Gemini could "understand the context" of your gallery.</p><p>The "Ask Photos" test involves a bit of Gemini's influence directly inside the Photos app, but Google's recent updates bring stronger integration via the AI's app on mobile.</p><p>With that in mind, perhaps it's a product of Google's huge <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-gemini-app-huge-flash-thinking-model-updates-announced">Gemini app personalization update</a> announcement. In that press release, the company mentioned the Photos app directly, stating users can ask for help/questions "based on your photos." It didn't mention any 2.0 Flash Thinking experimental influence, but it could be there under the hood.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung recently filed a patent on the World Intellectual Property Org.'s website showcasing sketches of a phone that folds four times.</li><li>The images show four screen panels that are connected with multiple hinges, allowing them to close inward.</li><li>The panels will be topped with a single glass cover display to give the device a crease-free look.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Looks like Samsung is taking foldables to the next level; as we wait for its first tri-fold device, aka the Galaxy G-fold, to show up, the company already seems to be working on a quad-fold phone.</p><p>The Korean OEM recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2025063475">filed a patent</a> on WIPO's (World Intellectual Property Organization) website showcasing a quad-fold phone, meaning a phone that could fold four times. The patent is titled "Electronic device including a bendable display" and was uploaded to the site on 27 March (as first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sammyguru.com/samsung-latest-patent-reveals-a-quad-fold-device-with-a-unique-design/">Sammy Guru</a>).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MobhKPoCYgUak8UZ5V47tD" name="Samsung-Quad-fold-Phone-patent" alt="Samsung files patent for quad fold device" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MobhKPoCYgUak8UZ5V47tD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO))</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The listing reveals several graphics of the potential design the phone could carry. It shows multiple angles of the multi-fold device, both folded and unfolded. In the image above, we see four screen panels connected together with multiple hinges, allowing it to fold inward.</p><p>It looks like the multi-fold will see the same functionality as the "tri-fold" phone, only that it will have each panel folding inward instead of just one, as some tri-fold phones have been shown to do. Assuming there's just one display across all hinges, this would give the device a large, tablet-like screen when folded outwards or as a compact phone that they can slide into their pockets when all sides are folded in.</p><p>While this is still a patent and doesn't mean that these illustrations will turn into usable devices, there may be some solid foundation that Samsung is building on.  The tech giant recently showed off prototypes of multi-fold screens at this year's MWC last month— <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mwc-2025-coolest-things-we-saw#section-samsung-display-s-claw-like-foldable">showcasing its Flex G and Flex S designs;</a> these are foldable panels that look like what its future tri-folding and multi-folding devices would look like. The company also showcased a claw-like foldable that could close vertically, leaving a sliver of screen at the center.</p>

<p>As of now, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-is-the-most-exciting-phone-around">Huawei's Mate XT</a> has been ruling the tri-fold phone market, although we've heard significant chatter that Samsung is planning to launch its rumored multi-fold phone, reportedly dubbed the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-g-fold-could-come-sooner-than-you-expect"> "Galaxy G Fold</a>,<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-g-fold-could-come-sooner-than-you-expect">"</a> along with the Galaxy Z Fold 7 in July this year — a Korean news site claims that this phone will go into mass production this month.</p><p>As Samsung continues to drop hints of its plans to release multi-fold phones in the future, it will be exciting to see how these patents will be conceptualized into devices.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-47">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google is working on a desktop-style Chrome for Android with extension support, something mobile Chrome has been missing.</li><li>This new version is designed for larger Android devices like Chromebooks, and it’s a big step toward closing the gap between mobile and desktop browsing.</li><li>It’s still a bit rough—no easy way to manage extensions, no toolbar button, and installing them isn’t as smooth as on desktop.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is apparently working on a unique version of Chrome for Android with a full-fledged desktop-style interface. This version stands out by finally <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/heres-how-google-could-safely-bring-extensions-chrome-android">bringing browser extension support</a>, something the current mobile Chrome completely lacks.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-google-chrome-tips-and-tricks">Google Chrome</a> might be huge on Android, but it has always lagged behind its desktop version, especially when it comes to extensions. Now, Google is working on changing that with a desktop-class Chrome for Android, finally bringing extension support into the mix, as per Mishaal Rahman over at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/chrome-for-android-with-extensions-demo-3540132/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>.</p><p>Thanks to a recent code tweak, users can now manually install extensions by simply dragging and dropping .crx files into the chrome://extensions page.</p>
<h2 id="built-for-big-screens-2">Built for big screens</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:70.70%;"><img id="SvXNPCUcg5kuHJc9pXdMEC" name="browser-extension-support-Chrome-Android" alt="browser extension support for Chrome on Android" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SvXNPCUcg5kuHJc9pXdMEC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="707" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>True to its name and the reports from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/desktop-chrome-android-extensions-3488455/" target="_blank">late 2024</a>, the Desktop Android version of Chrome is built to bring the browser’s core features to large-screen Android devices, including Chromebooks and other computers. With Chrome OS on its way out, a solid replacement is more important than ever.</p><p>Rahman has been putting these test Chrome builds through their paces, and the results speak for themselves. He's already got extensions like Dark Reader, Keepa, and uBlock Origin up and running, proving that an Android-based Chrome can fully support extensions.</p><p>Despite the progress, there are still a few hiccups. For one, users can’t access extension settings yet, and there’s no toolbar button to easily toggle extensions. Additionally, without a Chrome Web Store equivalent for Android, installing extensions still feels a bit basic. It works, but it's definitely not polished.</p><p>It appears that Google is currently putting all its energy into just making extensions work at all. So, to check on or manage your extensions, you'll need to head straight to the chrome://extensions page.</p>
<h2 id="regular-phones-don-t-hold-your-breath-2">Regular phones? Don’t hold your breath</h2>
<p>Adding extension support to Chrome for Android is a big step toward matching the desktop browsing experience. Sure, it’s still a bit rough around the edges, but make no mistake: this is the foundation for something huge.</p><p>That said, these changes probably won’t lead to extensions being available on Chrome for regular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>. Google has purposely stayed away from adding extension support on Android, unlike Firefox and Microsoft Edge, signaling a clear strategy behind the decision.</p>

The chip gets 2x larger shared memory that speeds up the user's interaction with LLMs or LVMs.</p><p>This Hexagon NPU also has the intelligence to snap better pictures automatically and is now enhanced to support a 320 MP single-camera sensor, significantly higher than the 200MP on the SD 8s Gen 3.</p><p>Higher sensor support comes with better photography, including better object recognition of up to 250 different things in a single 4K image, and helps capture photos that naturally color-correct the image based on the lighting around them. Additionally, this chip will also support better nighttime photography, with Night Vision 2.0 recording ultra-low light videos at a smooth 4K30 FPS.</p>

<p>Other notable features of the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 include uninterrupted entertainment with the Snapdragon Sound Technology Suite, featuring Qualcomm aptX Audio for lossless CD-quality music, and Qualcomm's eXpanded Personal Area Network (XPAN) technology, which "keeps earbuds and headphones connected via Wi-Fi" for uninterrupted audio during intense game sessions.</p><p>Lastly, when it comes to connectivity,  the chip gets the same Snapdragon 5G Modem-RF as the SD 8s Gen 3, which is said to increase download speeds up to 4.2Gbps on any 5G network and also works on conserving the device's battery when connected to it. It comes with support for Wi-Fi 7 at up to 5.8Gbps and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/bluetooth-6">Bluetooth 6</a>.</p><p>According to<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/qualcomm_snapdragon_8s_gen_4_announced_with_kryo_cpu_adreno_825_gpu-news-67213.php"> GSM Arena</a>, this chip is expected to debut on the iQOO Z10 Turbo and more devices from Xiaomi, Oppo, Meizu, and more.</p>

<hr>
<p>Motorola has announced a new mid-range phone for multiple regions under its popular Edge series. The Edge 60 Fusion claims to be designed for consumers who are seeking a premium smartphone with its elegant design and AI-driven features.</p><p>The colors of the Edge 60 Fusion appear to be the initial highlight of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">mid-range handset</a>, including the materials utilized for the unique finish. Motorola has opted to use faux-leather and canvas-inspired back panels to bring a distinctive aesthetic to the handset. The inclusion of Pantone-validated colors is also a plus.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GzB3tGajAtBQdRXqC6dtwP" name="Motorola-Edge-60-Fusion-colors" alt="Motorola Edge 60 Fusion" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GzB3tGajAtBQdRXqC6dtwP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Edge 60 Fusion also touts itself as a durable device as it comes with Corning Gorilla Glass 7i protection next to military standards (MIL-STD 810H) build and additionally it also has IP68 and IP69 ratings.</p><p>Moto AI has been incorporated into the latest handset, making it the first Motorola handset to feature it — to make "everyday tasks simpler and more intuitive." According to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://motorolanews.com/motorola-brings-the-worlds-first-quad-curve-edge-display-with-pantone-validated-colors-to-the-motorola-edge-60-fusion/">company's blog post</a>, the said AI features right out of the box include:</p>
<p>"Assistive prompts like Pay attention, which helps users record, transcribe, and summarize audio to create notes, and Remember this, which captures live moments or on-screen information when triggered, to more creative tools like Magic Canvas, which generates AI-created images from text prompts. Moto AI is there to make every experience on the Edge 60 Fusion smarter and more seamless. "</p>

<p>Meta and UFC have joined forces as part of an expansive, multi-year partnership to make Meta products and technologies a key part of UFC, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ufc.com/news/ufc-announces-comprehensive-multiyear-partnership-with-meta" target="_blank">announced</a> today, April 2. The partnership with Meta will "leverage its leading technologies to deliver unprecedented engagement with hundreds of millions of UFC fans around the world."</p><p>Meta becomes UFC's first Official Fan Technology Partner, as well as its first Official AI Glasses Partner (Ray-Ban Meta) and Official Social Media Partner (Threads). <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses</a> in particular will be used "in compelling ways at UFC events." Additionally, Meta AI, Meta Glasses, Meta Quest, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Threads will be used to "immerse fans deeper into UFC content than ever before."</p><p>The specifics of how exactly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-with-display-rumor">Ray-Ban Meta glasses</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review#">Meta Quests headsets</a> will be incorporated into UFC events are currently unclear.

<p>Now that the partnership is official, UFC President and CEO Dana White may have more to share regarding the new Meta experiences in the future.</p><p>"I've had a lot of great partners over the years that have helped us grow this sport, but Mark and his team at Meta are going to do things that will blow away UFC fans," said White.  "Meta has the greatest minds in tech and they are going to take fan engagement to the next level.  We've already started to work on some innovations with Meta around a new fighter rankings system that I'll be sharing soon."</p><p>The financial terms of the deal were not made public, but Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg — a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and MMA fighter himself — shares White's optimism.</p><p>"I love this sport and I’m looking forward to working with the UFC to let fans experience it in new ways," said Zuckerberg.</p><p>The two companies say that additional details of the partnership will be announced in the future.</p>

I made a mockup above based on Bloomberg's description, which should give you an idea of what to expect.</p><p>But it's the sEMG band that might be the most exciting feature, as it means a proper smart device experience can be had without having to hold a smartphone all the time. It means apps can be interacted with without feeling clunky like they do on a smartwatch, and it means messages can not only be read but also easily responded to.</p><p>I previously covered <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-semg-wristband-whitepaper">how sEMG bands work</a>, but the gist is that they can sense muscle movements in your hand and understand the difference between pinching your fingers together and scrolling with your thumb. The only thing that might get in the way is typing, but that's something <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-ai-gets-new-ways-to-communicate">Meta AI</a> is already very capable of doing by using your voice.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="tZtLYtFHn9XYoxmUYkeBBH" name="Meta-orion-ar-glasses-emg-wristband-press-photo.jpg" alt="Press photo of Meta's Orion EMG wristband, with the wearer making a pinching gesture." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tZtLYtFHn9XYoxmUYkeBBH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>The glasses are expected to be bundled with an sEMG band, which will make it dead easy to interact with apps despite the small screen.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>This is a huge step in the right direction for Meta as the company has struggled to release smart glasses products early enough to satisfy investors, often seeming to focus on the big picture rather than delivering smaller stepping-stone products that will get consumers interested in the concept.</p><p>The company's second pair of connected Ray-Ban glasses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/metas-ray-ban-smart-glasses-are-a-hit-and-its-now-planning-a-massive-production-ramp-up">have been a hit</a>, with Meta ramping up production in hopes of selling as many as 10 million this year. The next obvious step is to offer a new pair with a single display that begins getting people used to looking forward at a display instead of craning their necks downward all the time.</p><p>As this display is situated in the bottom portion of the right lens, you'll have to gaze downward at least a little bit to get the clearest view. From my estimation, this is a much better design than Google Glass — the closest conceptual product I can think of — as Glass required you to look <em>up</em> to see the display. If I'm walking in a city and need to look at directions, I don't want to be looking away from the sidewalk.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9gfNHgJm4cSfD3BPB3TQ5M" name="ray-ban-meta-view-app" alt="The Meta View app, used to connect to Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses, running on an Honor Magic V3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9gfNHgJm4cSfD3BPB3TQ5M.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Meta View app which will be used to connect the glasses to your phone. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Since these glasses are powered by Android, Bloomberg says there will be a handful of apps that ship with it but that it won't have a dedicated app store. Apps include Meta's messaging platforms like WhatsApp and Messenger, a camera app for using the upgraded cameras on the glasses, as well as a maps app for visual directions and navigation.</p><p>But while these glasses aren't prepared to replace your phone just yet, they are the gateway into augmenting the phone experience to get you less reliant on your little black mirror and more comfortable with using Meta AI and alternative forms of input. They'll still connect to your phone using the Meta View app that existing Ray-Ban Meta glasses use, but at least some of that connection won't be required now that these glasses will have onboard computing.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>These new glasses would be powered by Android and be capable of running apps on the small screen in the right lens.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>These glasses will not feature positional tracking like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Meta Orion</a> prototype or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-aria-gen-2-smart-glasses-look-like-serious-upgrade-on-ray-ban-meta">Meta Aria Gen 2</a> research glasses. Most likely, this is to help shave some of the cost off the price tag as well as provide reasonable battery life.</p><p>It's unreasonable to expect a fully-featured pair of smart glasses to somehow be light enough for comfort <em>and</em> have all-day battery life in this day and age, but that's a problem that might be solved a few years in the future.</p><p>Meta is also said to be upgrading the camera, something <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/these-smart-glasses-have-given-me-a-new-reason-to-record-video-again">I'm particularly excited about</a> since I use the Ray-Ban Meta Smart glasses camera all the time. The analogy was that the current camera is roughly equivalent to an iPhone 11, while the new camera will be equivalent to an iPhone 13.</p><p>This is, essentially, the start of the future Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg spoke about when he said Meta would lead the tech space into a post-smartphone era. These new Hypernova glasses are said to retail for between $1,000 and $1,400, so it'll still be a while before they're affordable enough to make a dent in the smartphone market.</p>

<p>Meta looks to be releasing several different shades this year, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/metas-xr-plans-reportedly-include-seeding-orion-to-devs-and-oakley-smart-glasses">a potential Oakley-branded pair</a> known as Supernova 2 within Meta's R&D labs. These glasses will be more full-featured than Hypernova and are said to be optimized for athletic use, which makes sense given Oakley's popularity with bikers and in some other sports.</p><p>Bloomberg's report also details the existence of Hypernova 2, a follow-up to the glasses described above that would feature two displays — one in each lens. Meta is said to still be working on a fully standalone pair of smart glasses that don't rely on a connection to a phone, but those glasses — currently known as Artemis — are likely still two years away.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-gear/samsung-could-be-working-smart-glasses">Samsung's Project HAEAN</a> smart glasses are said to be making a debut this year alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Project Moohan</a> XR headset. HAEAN is said to look similar to Ray-Ban Meta Smart glasses and is powered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google Gemini</a>, similar to the Google smart glasses you see in the image above.</p><p>HAEAN will likely be a direct competitor to the upcoming Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses, as they reportedly feature a display in the lenses. Little else is known about HAEAN at this time.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/10/apple-still-exploring-smart-glasses-meta-ray-bans/">Bloomberg also reported</a> that Apple is working on a similar pair, ensuring that Meta will be feverishly working on market-ready products faster than ever to keep up with competition from the biggest tech brands.</p>

<ul><li>A tipster claims there's evidence in the Galaxy S24's One UI 7 beta code that points towards the possibility of Now Brief support.</li><li>Nothing works; however, the tipster was able to discover the Now Brief's official page and app options.</li><li>A Samsung exec recently stated that not every major AI feature in One UI 7 will hit older devices due to hardware limitations.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Amidst the One UI 7 anticipation, it seems a few of Samsung's older devices could receive a Galaxy S25 feature.</p><p>There's a chance Samsung could drop a version of One UI 7's Now Brief on one of its past-gen Galaxy series, at least according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MEMETCAN88/status/1906770062435889446">Mehmet Kaya on X</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-now-brief-galaxy-s23-fold-6-flip-6-more-devices/">SamMobile</a>). The rumor started after the tipster allegedly discovered the feature while searching "Activity Launcher" in the latest OS beta. The tipster states searching for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-set-up-and-use-now-brief-on-the-galaxy-s25">Now Brief</a> will bring up its respective page full of feature details, as well as its list of supported Samsung apps.</p><p>However, they add that users won't see it in action during the beta. In their thread, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MEMETCAN88/status/1906790896261067217">the tipster states</a> Samsung has "disabled it," which could indicate more work is required before it can be seen.</p><p>Another user, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/thatjoshguy69/status/1892878357009699231">That Josh Guy</a>, chimed in, stating these whispers of Now Brief for the Galaxy S24 appeared in One UI 7 Beta 4. The user states the small "traces of code" don't give a live example but only hint at its base functions and pages where users can customize it or update it. Their post states they had to go "root level deep" to even access the core of the function, which seemingly indicates the ability for the Galaxy S24 to run Now Brief.</p><p>It's not clear if Samsung plans to bring the Now Brief to the past-gen series when One UI 7 launches or</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Breaking. Now brief feature is available in s24 series. Oneui 7 beta 6 is also hidden but I've uncovered with activity launcher.@tarunvats33 @SamMobiles @theonecid @UniverseIce pic.twitter.com/uvLoHZOJAu<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1906770062435889446">March 31, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Interestingly, the publication notes that the same code was discovered in the One UI 7 beta for the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Fold 6.</p><p>This discovery leads us back to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-ai-hardware-limitations-interview-highlight">a recent interview</a> with Samsung's EVP and head of Framework R&D, Sally. During the discussion, Sally highlighted that not every One UI 7 feature will arrive for Samsung's past-gen devices. They stated major on-device processes, like the Personal Data Engine, are extremely reliant on the phone's or tablet's available hardware. As such, the engine requires Qualcomm's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-vs-regular-snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> to operate.</p><p>Sally added that more affordable phones will likely miss out on the bulk of One UI 7's major AI features since the available hardware isn't strong enough. One question that remained was whether or not the Now Bar/Now Brief would arrive on older phones. Nothing is confirmed, but evidence of the feature <em>could </em>indicate that this specific feature isn't so hardware-reliant.</p><p>Either way, Samsung confirmed One UI 7 will arrive on April 10 in the U.S. However, its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-schedule-galaxy-dates-spotted-overseas">fully detailed rollout schedule</a> was discovered on its Czech Republic website, potentially giving us an idea of what to expect.</p>

<p>NotebookLM is an AI-powered notebook that can help you study or understand virtually anything, and it works by intaking uploaded content, called sources. These sources could be documents, notes, or webpages, and you can upload them to a NotebookLM project. Starting today, April 2, Google is automating the process with a new <strong>Discover sources</strong> feature that scours the web for source links on your behalf, it announced in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/google-labs/notebooklm-discover-sources/" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p><p>This functionality combines Google AI and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini's</a> ability to search the web with sourcing in NotebookLM projects. When users click the new <strong>Discover sources</strong> button in NotebookLM, they can describe the topic of their project. After that, NotebookLM takes care of the rest.</p><p>"NotebookLM gathers hundreds of potential web sources in seconds," Google explains. "It analyzes them and picks the most relevant ones based on your defined topic. It presents up to 10 source recommendations, each with an annotated summary explaining its relevance to your topic."</p><p>By checking the box for each suggested source recommendation, it will become available in your NotebookLM project, providing additional context. These sources can be used with Briefing Docs, FAQs, and Audio Overviews, and are also available for reading, note-taking, and citation purposes. On top of that, you can use the chatbot to converse with AI about the suggested sources.</p>

It's called <strong>I'm feeling curious</strong>, and it "generates sources on a random topic, offering a quick way for you to see the product’s source discovery agent in action."</p><p>Google says the Discover sources feature is "the first of a series of NotebookLM features that uses the power of Gemini to find and collect relevant sources for your notebook."</p><p>The tool will be available to all NotebookLM users, on free and paid tiers, and is rolling out starting today. It could take a week for all users to gain access to the feature.</p>

<p>Similar to how Google has worked to bring more AI features <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/samsung-lenovo-debut-chromebooks-google-update-details">to the Chromebook Plus</a>, MediaTek states it has done the same in tandem with the former. Adam King adds, "We worked closely with Google to ensure the newest Chromebook Plus devices enjoy next-generation on-device AI capabilities, superior performance per watt, and immersive multimedia.”</p><p>The Taiwanese OEM announced it has integrated 50 TOPS NPU for "greater" on-device generative AI processes. This 8th-generation NPU also brings personalized computing capabilities, "seamless" AI-enhanced workflows, and more. Future consumers can also expect quicker local processing speeds, security, efficiency, and AI workload support even without a Wi-Fi connection.</p><p>Elsewhere, Google's VP and GM for ChromeOS and Google for Education, John Solomon, said, "We're excited for the next step in our MediaTek partnership." Solomon states this new venture will open up "new avenues for on-device AI" while also delivering "awesome power efficiency" when users are on the go.</p>

<hr>
<p>New information regarding a year-old rumor about a Find My Device update may suggest an impending launch.</p><p>X tipster AssembleDebug and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/find-my-device-uwb-3540807/">Android Authority</a> went through a recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/ask-jerry-which-earbuds-support-google-find-my-device-network-2024">Find My Device</a> app update, which holds more clues about its supposed UWB update. One of the highlights in Google's newly uploaded code/content includes a UWB function animation. The tipster was able to view this short clip, which will allegedly direct users on how to hold their phone to relocate lost devices.</p><p>The feature seems to prefer to be held more upright or slightly tilted back; however, holding your phone more landscape will interfere with its UWB relocator.</p><p>Meanwhile, v3.1.305-1 of the app has reportedly received extra bits of code as Google progresses with the feature. The post highlights the existence of the UWB-powered scanning dubbed "precision_finding" in the app. Here, the code gives more info behind that early demo video, stating you should "hold your phone straight up and try moving around." This will supposedly aid in its accuracy.</p><p>Interestingly, the early strings of code state the feature might rely on your room's lighting situation. One string states, "more light needed to find the device."</p>

<p>Rumors <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-ar-directions-uwb-find-my-device">of UWB support</a> headed for the Find My Device app started in early June 2024. Code from almost a year ago echoes what we've seen today, at least regarding its name: "precision finding." There wasn't much else back then when compared to what Google has added to the app's code recently. However, it seems the company has plans to implement more AR-based directions, too.</p><p>Last year's discovery showcased how the app could use AR technology to direct users on-screen to where their UWB-supported tracker/device is. More concrete details on its complete functions aren't known yet, but it seems Google hasn't dropped this idea.</p><p>The Find My Device app has been relatively quiet, aside from a recent update that brought <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-find-my-device-app-people-tab-update-rollout">a new "People" tab</a>. From the new page, users can easily share their current location with "trusted contacts." The feature mirrors what you'd find in Google Maps as your family or friends will see your profile picture, name, location (address), and device battery. This feature was mentioned in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixels-march-2025-feature-drop">Google's March feature drop</a>, but it just started rolling out two weeks after its initial highlight.</p>

<ul><li>YouTube is taking action against accounts that create fake movie trailers with the help of AI and mislead viewers from the get-go.</li><li>Two major accounts with over two million subscribers combined were the first to take the hit as YouTube shut down ad revenue for them.</li><li>YouTube removed both channels from the YouTube Partner Program “for violating monetization policies."</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>YouTube seems to be taking steps to curb the production of fake movie trailers that trick users, generating millions of views and revenue from these videos. But instead of taking down these videos or accounts linked to them, it is demonetizing these channels.</p><p>You've likely scrolled through YouTube and encountered clickbait movie trailers that promise a surprise Marvel sequel or the trailer for Harry Potter and the Cursed Child with a cover picture showcasing Daniel Radcliffe as the lead. But these genuine-looking trailers are nothing but fake videos edited to seem real. Now, with the help of AI, it has become much easier to simply give it a prompt and see the magic happen.</p><p>According to a report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://deadline.com/2025/03/youtube-ad-revenue-fake-movie-trailer-screen-culture-1236354143/">Deadline</a>, YouTube has turned off the ability for two major fake movie trailer accounts to monetize their videos, which have been seemingly created with the help of AI. The accounts in concern are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/@ScreenCultureOfficial">Screen Culture</a> and<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=kh+studio"> KH Studio</a> trailers which have over two million subscribers combined.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nwdT9B6BFSHHw9ouzAt76P" name="Screen-Culture-home-page" alt="Screen Cultures' YT home page" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nwdT9B6BFSHHw9ouzAt76P.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/Android Central )</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Screen Culture, which has over 1.4 million subscribers, is notorious for creating conceptual fan trailers of movies that look like the real deal. In the recent past, the account has been leveraging AI to create scenarios with existing footage from old movies and mashing it up with new AI footage to create fake trailers.</p><p>KH Studios, with nearly 700K subscribers, creates trailers based on imagined movies and "what if" scenarios. For example, they've created trailers imagining Henry Cavill as the next James Bond or Leonardo DiCaprio in a Squid Game season, Deadline states.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JJqpuE33cUF7cMEp8L9gw8" name="Youtube-KH-studios-Ironman4-fan trailer" alt="Image showing KH studio's Iron Man 4 fan trailer" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JJqpuE33cUF7cMEp8L9gw8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Due to both channels showcasing misleading content, YouTube suspended both Screen Culture and KH Studios for violating monetization policies, and now they cannot earn ad revenue from all of their videos. While both channels can appeal to counter YouTube's decision, its highly unlikely that things will change in their favor.</p><p>YouTube's<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1311392?hl=en"> monetization policy clearly states</a> that while creators do have freedom of speech, they should "avoid creating content that is misleading or controversial and the "video content should not be deceptive or clickbait." And both channels seem to be repeat offenders of the above.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2eVc334fHSBSNuLipjwTqR" name="YouTube-LifeStyle-16x9-01.jpg" alt="YouTube on Galaxy Z Fold 2 with toys around it" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2eVc334fHSBSNuLipjwTqR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Chris Wedel)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While Screen Culture is yet to put out an official statement or comment on the matter, KH Studios' founder told Deadline, “I’ve been running KH Studio full-time for over three years now, putting everything into it. It’s tough to see it grouped under “misleading content” in the demonetization decision when my goal has always been to explore creative possibilities – not to misrepresent real releases,” they added.</p><p>YouTube hasn't commented on the matter yet. However, Android Central has reached out to the streaming platform and will update this article once we have more information.</p>

<p>It looks like Samsung is all but guaranteed to bring back the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic. And while it's the right move to resurrect its signature design, this alternating system leaves a gap year for Samsung fans who care, first and foremost, about battery life.</p><p>Or, to put it more bluntly, thinking about the inevitable Classic only makes me wistful for the dead Pro lineup, and I wish the two could be merged.</p><p>This week, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-gear/new-leak-hints-at-the-samsung-galaxy-watch-8s-existence">Galaxy Watch 8 leak</a> indicated it'll ship in its usual two case sizes, with the larger model hitting 435mAh capacity — just 10mAh more than the Watch 7 44mm. This same leak indicated there'll likely be two Watch 8 Classic models; we didn't see any battery data, but the Watch 6 Classic and 4 Classic both matched their cheaper counterparts.</p><p>A second leak indicated Samsung is working on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring/samsung-galaxy-ring-2-dream-batteries-rumored">all-solid-state batteries</a>, but it won't add one to a Galaxy Watch until "late 2027." While OnePlus used <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-kicks-off-battery-arms-race-for-smartwatches">silicon-carbon tech</a> in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-review">OnePlus Watch 3</a> to make it last five days, we can probably expect the usual 40-ish hours of battery life Samsung always offers.</p><p>Samsung will keep the Galaxy Watch 8 skinny and affordable, as it should. But if we're never going to see a Pro again — and with the Ultra too pricey for some — I'd like to see the Classic take after the Pro and bridge the battery gap, unlikely as that may seem.</p>

<p>I reviewed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-pro-review">Galaxy Watch 5 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Watch 6 Classic</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Watch Ultra</a> the last three summers. Samsung's experimentation with new designs kept things so fresh that it gave me whiplash; I never knew what Samsung would prioritize in a given year.</p><p>I only started reviewing smartwatches regularly in 2022. After a few skinny, plastic running watches with weeks-long battery life, the 2022 Watch 5 Pro was my first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watch</a> (or traditional smartwatch, period). I was a relative newbie, in other words, and my complaints against it feel mostly off-base now.</p><p>I said the Pro "gave a whole new meaning to the word heavy." With later context, it's still not what I'd call light, but most flagship watches are trending bulkier by about half an ounce. And it earns the weight, thanks to the battery. I was being way too dramatic.</p><p>I complained that the Pro was uncomfortable for sleep tracking, not realizing yet that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smartwatch-vs-smart-ring-sleep-tracking">I hated wearing <em>any</em> smartwatch to bed</a>. I stand by my complaint about the terrible default D-Buckle Sport band, though.</p><p>I argued that there "wasn't enough difference" in performance between the Pro and Watch 5, but that's been the norm on much pricier Ultra watches because there aren't enough smartwatch chips for there to <em>be</em> any differentiation.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="mJjRWwATDCDjZs6CSKawze" name="Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-vs.-Watch-5-Pro-on-wrists.jpeg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra vs. Watch 5 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mJjRWwATDCDjZs6CSKawze.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I don't want to keep wearing the Watch 5 Pro <em>now</em>: the chip is a couple of generations behind, with less RAM and a dimmer, thicker-bordered display than I'm used to these days. However, I do think that the Pro's design didn't deserve to be a one-off, and I'd be much kinder to a new version today.</p><p>My wrist has been trained for heavier watches like the Galaxy Watch Ultra or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>, but growing accustomed to something doesn't mean I prefer it. Once I tried the three-day <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2r-review">OnePlus Watch 2R</a> last year, it reminded me that you don't need a <em>massive</em> watch<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review"> </a>for it to be long-lasting.</p><p>Man, would I love a Galaxy Watch 8 Pro with a battery to write home about, paired with three generations of upgrades. But since that may not happen, let's talk about the rumored Classic.</p>
<h2 id="the-galaxy-watch-8-classic-can-be-more-than-a-pretty-face-2">The Galaxy Watch 8 Classic can be more than a pretty face</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="3tfd7js5w3hVqAtRgwv2X5" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-6-Classic-apps.jpg" alt="The app list on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3tfd7js5w3hVqAtRgwv2X5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If Samsung sticks to the same look as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-review">Galaxy Watch 4 Classic</a> and Watch 6 Classic, I'm sure a Watch 8 Classic will remain popular with long-time fans. Samsung is oddly stubborn about adding a crown to its watches, so the Classic is our one chance to get more precise non-touch controls when navigating through tiles. And it looks great, especially the lighter case colors.</p><p>I simply wish that the Classic offered something more than a facelift. It's already quite heavy and thick thanks to the rotating bezel; to have it weigh about as much as any Ultra watch but last half as long is hard to accept, especially in an era where OnePlus has shown it's possible to stretch a Wear OS watch's battery to the limits.</p><p>Consider the report last year that a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-management-furious-latest-product-design">Samsung exec was "angry" about "design plagiarism"</a> because the Galaxy Watch Ultra looked too much like an Apple Watch Ultra. I think some of this was overblown by the media; both Ultras look very different in person. But it's fair to question whether Samsung might go back to the drawing board with a new design or scrap the Ultra.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3701px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="C679DtBoDyMeLTiJWe6W5o" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-vs-apple-watch-ultra-2-1.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra vs. Apple Watch Ultra 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C679DtBoDyMeLTiJWe6W5o.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3701" height="2082" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I suspect the Galaxy Watch Ultra lineup isn't going anywhere, even if it's redesigned. But it leaves the Classic in an awkward position because Samsung now wants to treat extra battery life as a $650 perk, even as $300–400 rivals lap it.</p><p>In an ideal world, Samsung would alternate between the Classic in odd years and <em>both</em> the Pro and Ultra in even years, so extra battery life is a mid-range perk in a more comfortable package while the Ultra adds other bells and whistles.</p><p>But since that's not going to happen, I'll settle for another unlikely alternative: a Watch 8 Classic that splits the difference and offers a <em>slight</em> battery boost. Even one more day would be appreciated!</p><p>So, until more leaks come in that dash my hopes, I'll cross my fingers that the Watch 8 Classic brings back a little bit of the Watch 5 Pro's legacy.</p>

<hr>
<p>It is that time of the year where some Sony phone enthusiasts expect this year's flagship phone from the company, dubbed Xperia 1 VII. Ahead of the anticipated launch, a new leak reveals the device through renders and gives away some of the specs as well.</p><p>The leak comes from prominent tipster Steve Hemmerstoffer (aka OnLeaks) in collaboration with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.xpertpick.com/mobile/sony-xperia-1-vii-cad-renders-360-degree-video/">XpertPick</a>,  has shared high-quality renders of the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android flagship phone</a> from Sony. Going by the renders, it appears the company is sticking to the predecessor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/sony-xperia-1-vi-launch">Xperia 1 VI</a>'s design for the 1 VII too.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">OK #FutureSquad... Here comes your very first look at the #Sony #Xperia1VII (360° video + crispy sharp 5K renders + dimensions)!😏Today, on behalf of new Partner XpertPick 👉🏻 https://t.co/X5rO50feYQ pic.twitter.com/PAlK0pmbw5<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1907383064432435631">April 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>The phone appears taller with noticeable chins at the top and bottom of the display, while the side bezels seem negligible. On the right pane, we can notice the volume rocker, textured power button, and a dedicated camera button. The back panel also includes the familiar triple camera array as seen on the previous iterations.</p><p>While there aren't any notable visual changes on the upcoming Xperia 1 VII, the publication shares additional information about the handset, like its expected specifications.</p>

<p>The handset is expected to be powered by Snapdragon 8 Elite and will likely measure 161.9 x 74.5 x 8.5mm (approximately) — making it slightly thicker than the predecessor. The screen, however, is also predicted to be sporting the same 6.5-inch screen with a rumored 19.5:9 aspect ratio.</p><p>Further, the device is tipped to be featuring dual front-firing speakers and, in addition, users can also expect the good-old 3.5mm audio jack, which is sort of an Xperia exclusive parameter when it comes to flagship phones.</p><p>The handset is further expected to bank on Android 15 operating system out of the box and will likely be offered with a 5000mAh battery capacity and support for 30W fast charging. Lastly, going by the predecessor launch, the Xperia 1 VII is anticipated to be released sometime in May.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I've always been fascinated by tech. From biotech to future tech and everything in between, I've wanted to try it all and then break it down so I understand how it works. Even so, if you had told me 30 years ago that one day, a small handheld device would be able to create an image out of thin air and a text prompt, I wouldn't have believed it.</p><p>Yet here we are, and your phone can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-gemini-model-highlights">turn what you say into a picture through AI</a>. It's often not a great picture (and can even be a disturbing mess), but it's still a piece of machinery doing something that <em>used</em> to require a human. It still does. Technically, it requires a lot of humans to spend a lot of time.</p>

<h2 id="the-work-happens-before-you-use-it-2">The work happens before you use it</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TkNeAYe9huCZSzBo5Xo3h8" name="Magic-Canvas-Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024" alt="An AI-generated image of Sora from Kingdom Hearts and R2-D2." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TkNeAYe9huCZSzBo5Xo3h8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Modern AI works using a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/does-pixel-5-have-neural-core-chip" target="_blank">neural network</a>. You might recognize that the word neural means related to the nervous system, and that's not accidental. Computers aren't organic and don't have a nervous system, but they can mimic the process and function in their own way. That's where everything starts: with a convolutional neural network.</p><p>These specialize in the ability to recognize patterns and objects — not in the same way we do, but in a way that's almost as cool, even if not nearly as complex as a human eye and brain.</p><p>You don't remember an exact replica of everything you've ever learned or can recognize. You know a shirt is a shirt regardless of what color it is, for example, because your brain knows what a shirt is; you don't have to see every shirt in the world to recognize one.</p><p>AI does something similar. It's trained from processing hundreds of millions of images, each with a description stating exactly what the image is. Take this one, for example:</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qnseqCfB4Dh37ekFgoqbTi" name="cheeseburger" alt="A photo of a cheeseburger and fries." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qnseqCfB4Dh37ekFgoqbTi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is a cheeseburger and a side of fries. But it can be described in much more detail:</p><p><em>This is a photograph of food. It has a cheeseburger with two pieces of bacon and Swiss cheese, and a bun that looks moist. There are visible grill lines on the meat patty, and some of the meat patty's juices have soaked into the bun. There is also a wire basket that is a replica of a deep fryer basket holding at least 13 pieces of what look to be sliced potatoes. They have been fried, and at least one of them is slightly burned.</em></p><p><em>On a different, smaller plate are the remnants of an unknown appetizer with a small dish of unmelted butter in the center. There is also a small square plate with a fork and knife laid on it and a goblet off to the side filled partially with an unknown liquid. The tabletop is brown wood and there are reflections of red and yellow light near the top.</em></p><p>This is how images should be described as they are fed into an AI training algorithm. Every detail is analyzed, and nothing is insignificant because the computers doing the "looking" are looking for a pattern inside the visual noise of the photo.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>When training AI, every detail matters, even the seemingly insignificant ones.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Eventually the model will be able to take a prompt and recreate the right noise patterns to build an image because it has the right amount of the right kind of data. Everything in an analyzed image is relevant, not just the cheeseburger that you and I would notice.</p><p>With enough analyzed data, it can serve as a path or set of instructions to create a new image that fulfills a user request. It's not taking bits and pieces of images it has already seen and piecing them together like a puzzle; it's simply creating patterns of visual noise. With enough training, those patterns end up looking like an image.</p><p>This also explains why some models get some things really wrong. AI can only create based on what it was trained on; if you train using 100,000,000 photos of black dogs but never include a brown one, the AI can never create an image of a brown dog, no matter how you try to tell it to do so.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/geminis-fiasco-proves-ai-is-moving-too-fast-for-googleso-whats-next">Bias exists</a> because AI is trained on web data, and certain things are overrepresented while others are underrepresented. This makes its way into the results because, as we discussed, AI can only recreate what it was trained on. Ask AI to create an image of a scientist wearing a shirt with the Croatian flag and blue sneakers, and the doctor will probably be Caucasian simply because of how the training data was represented.</p><p>You could ask for an image of a black scientist with the same shirt and shoes sitting in a wheelchair, and you would likely be presented with one. Like during the training, a good description matters a lot.</p>
<p>AI will continue to get better, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-image-3-custom-gems-update-detailed">image generation</a> will be part of it. Researchers have plenty of hurdles, not only with fine-tuning an algorithm and using representative data but also trying to ethically work around inherent bias and incomplete training data.</p><p>We've come a long way in just a few years, and things do not look to be slowing down anytime soon.</p>

<hr>
<p>Only a day after we reported that the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge could launch on April 15, new reports of its delayed launch have sprouted.</p><p>The latest Korean report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.etnews.com/20250402000203">ET News</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-launch-postponed-report/">SamMobile</a>) notes that Samsung might be halting the release of the anticipated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-teaser">Galaxy S25 Edge</a>. It was initially tipped to be releasing in April but now it could probably happen only in May or June.</p><p>The report further noted that the Korean tech giant has indicated the same launch information to the telecom operators who are believed to be selling the upcoming Edge phone to the consumers in Korea.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3801px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5FeTFYje2z29mH34VfNcV4" name="Samsung-GAlaxy-S25-Edge-MWC-2025-2" alt="The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge on display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5FeTFYje2z29mH34VfNcV4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3801" height="2138" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The initial launch date according to the Korean report has been set for April 15 — the same date was set for Europe release as well, according to a recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/looks-like-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-could-launch-in-two-weeks?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=dhtwitter&utm_content=null">Netherland-based report</a>. However, while the specific reason for the launch postponement is still unclear, the re-adjustment of the launch date wasn't due to quality concerns but rather due to some internal changes, that happened in the Samsung team, especially in the business department.</p><p>Meanwhile, another reliable tipster Ice Universe on X has also shared the same news of postponement in his latest X post.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What I want to say is this bad news: the release of Samsung S25 edge has been postponed.

<p>The Galaxy S25 Edge is a highly anticipated device launch of this year, and there seem to be various takeaways for the device even before it is released to the masses. It is one of the slimmest devices that Samsung has ever made, which translates to measuring 5.8mm in thickness.</p><p>The display, however, is expected to be the same as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-review">Galaxy S25 Plus</a> measuring 6.7 inches. Underneath, the S25 Edge is likely powered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-soc-for-galaxy-s25-series">Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a> same as the flagship trio.</p><p>The device is also expected to come in three colorways — Sliver, Black, and Blue. The ultra slim phone is also touted to be coming in 256GB and 512GB storage options and further have at least 12GB of RAM.

On the one hand, I'm disappointed, but on the other, my excitement wants to spiral out of control.</p><p>So why the conflict? Well, according to the renders from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-alleged-porcelain-renderings-leaked">@OnLeaks and Android Headlines</a>, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is going to look almost identical to the 9 Pro Fold. Everything from the displays to the cameras, and maybe even the colors, will be the same.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1412px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="hvewYswQphNguzfjxft4Qg" name="google-pixel-10-pro-fold-leaked-render-closed" alt="A leaked rendering of the alleged Pixel 10 Pro Fold in a Porcelain color." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hvewYswQphNguzfjxft4Qg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1412" height="794" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Recycling designs is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/im-tired-of-buying-new-cases">same complaint</a> that I've had with the Galaxy Z Fold series over the past three iterations. Minor changes here and there, but really, it's nothing more than just swapping out the chip. All the while, it continues to charge the same amount and points the finger elsewhere to deflect the blame and explain why we're still being charged so much.</p><p>This imaginary line in the sand is where Google apparently decided to step back from. In addition to sharing some renders and specs, we also learned that Google is reportedly considering dropping its next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a> to a "lower price point." This, I would argue, is the correct move to make, especially if the only notable change is an upgrade to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/is-googles-switch-from-samsung-foundry-to-tsmc-for-the-tensor-g5-chip-a-big-deal">Tensor G5</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="CADi6sXzFaP6wVqNGAvNjb" name="pixel-9-pro-fold-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-screens-open.jpg" alt="Pixel 9 Pro Fold and Galaxy Z Fold 6 side-by-side with screens open" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CADi6sXzFaP6wVqNGAvNjb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For one, we don't actually know how much of an upgrade this G5 will be over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> found in 2024's crop of Google flagships. More importantly (to me at least), it also appears that we may get the same cameras again, which puts me back in the "disappointed" column.</p><p>Don't get me wrong; I'm a big fan of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold's cameras</a>, especially the Galaxy Z Fold 6. But the problem is that they aren't the "best" that you can get in a Pixel, as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">9 Pro XL</a> is equipped with newer and better hardware than its foldable brethren.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GmKvsVuJfCQVN3E3GTSyy5" name="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review-5.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold rear camera module" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GmKvsVuJfCQVN3E3GTSyy5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google claims this decision was made to make the 9 Pro Fold as thin as possible. Since the camera bar was replaced with an island, the sensors were just too large for what Google set out to achieve. That being said, I'm still holding out hope that the 10 Pro Fold will at least include an upgraded telephoto lens.</p><p>However, the only reason why I'm not immediately writing off the Pixel 10 Pro Fold for pulling the same crap that Samsung and Apple do is because of the price. We haven't seen or heard specifics yet, and nothing is confirmed until the official launch (so take the latest rumors with a grain of salt), but Google finds itself in a rather unique position.</p><p>It's just Google against Samsung, as OnePlus opted against releasing a rebranded <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">OPPO Find N5</a>. Meanwhile, Motorola remains focused on challenging Samsung's Z Flip line, forgoing the book-style foldable.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="AHwsGURjW4rscnmmvEzM24" name="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review-8.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold on table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AHwsGURjW4rscnmmvEzM24.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1405" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If these rumors and renders prove to be real, Google could surprise us all by releasing the Pixel 10 Pro Fold for around $1,500. At least, that's the logical price that comes to mind, as it's usually what the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/thats-not-a-typo-this-google-pixel-9-pro-deal-from-amazon-makes-black-friday-look-like-a-joke">9 Pro Fold is discounted</a> to when it's on sale. But what if Google went through its entire announcement presentation, and on the last slide, we see "$1,299" for the 10 Pro Fold?</p><p>Is it realistic? No. Is it possible? Oh, it's definitely possible. It's just a matter of profit margins for Google's bottom line. But it would simply be incredible if we ended up with the Pixel 10 Pro Fold being priced the same as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>. And Samsung would never see it coming.</p>

Powered by Samsung’s Exynos 1580, the Galaxy Tab S10 FE series is a step-up from its predecessors in terms of AI capabilities.</p>
<h2 id="ai-upgrades-2">AI upgrades</h2>
<p>You’re getting Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> for quick info on the fly, smarter Samsung Notes that can solve math problems and clean up your handwriting, and upgraded editing tools like an improved Object Eraser and the new Best Face feature.</p><p>There’s also Auto Trim for effortless video highlights and a dedicated Galaxy AI Hot Key on the Book Cover Keyboard for instant AI access.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:69.60%;"><img id="ad2EhdDFPHQ5PSwKkbE9mG" name="Galaxy-Tab-S10-FE-Book-Cover-Keyboard-Slim" alt="Galaxy Tab S10 FE Book Cover Keyboard Slim in black" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ad2EhdDFPHQ5PSwKkbE9mG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4500" height="3132" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Aside from those AI perks, the Galaxy Tab S10 FE series sticks to pretty standard specs.</p><p>Samsung is playing it safe with the Tab S10 FE’s design. You’re looking at the same aluminum body, chunky bezels, and a magnetic S Pen snap-on from previous models.</p>
<h2 id="the-cameras-are-kinda-meh-2">The cameras are kinda meh</h2>
<p>The Tab S10 FE Plus dials it back to just a 13MP rear camera, dropping the 8MP ultrawide from the previous version. Up front, it gets a 12MP camera for selfies or video calls.</p><p>The Plus model also steps it up with a massive 13.1-inch display, which is 12% bigger than before, making it the largest FE tablet yet. It sticks with an IPS LCD panel, which is pretty standard for mid-range tablets, though it won’t match the deep contrast and brightness of those high-end OLED screens.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="oJGWFSAmNHeGYcRbCrroAR" name="Galaxy-Tab-S10-FE-silver-screen-and-back-panel" alt="Galaxy Tab S10 FE screen and rear panel in silver" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oJGWFSAmNHeGYcRbCrroAR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4500" height="3000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Meanwhile, the regular Tab S10 FE sticks with the same 10.9-inch screen as last year’s model. At least the screen is clean, with no notches or pinholes messing up your view.</p><p>Both models rock a 90Hz refresh rate and pack Vision Booster tech for better clarity in bright lighting. On top of that, they come with Samsung Knox security and an IP68 rating, meaning they’re built to handle dust, water, and whatever life throws at them.</p><p>The Plus model packs a 10,090mAh battery, which should pair nicely with the Exynos 1580 for solid power efficiency. The regular Tab S10 FE gets an 8,000mAh battery, which is not too shabby either, and likely good for all-day use without hunting for a charger.</p>

<p>Both models support 45W wired charging, so you won’t be stuck waiting forever to power back up.</p><p>Samsung says the tablets arrive on April 10 and will come in three colors: Gray, Silver, and Blue.</p>

Now, as companies like Google and Apple try to compete, they're starting way behind OpenAI, at least in the eyes of the public. Just how big of a head start does OpenAI have? As of March 2025, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chatgpt-could-be-set-as-default-assistant">ChatGPT</a> has 700 million monthly active users, which is a staggering total.</p><p>That doesn't mean Google is powerless in the fight against OpenAI for the bulk of consumer-grade AI market share. In the years since ChatGPT was released, Google ramped up AI development first through Bard, later renamed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>. While OpenAI's plan to monetize ChatGPT involved making a bunch of early features free and locking advanced ones behind a paywall, Google is doing the opposite.</p><p>With Gemini, Google is almost exclusively developing new features for its paid Gemini Advanced tier, but that doesn't tell the whole story. Those features start out exclusive to the Google One AI Premium plan, which costs $20 per month, but they don't stay there for long. In the case of the company's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-2-5-pro-is-googles-latest-ai-model-with-thinking-and-multimodality-built-in">latest Gemini 2.5 Pro experimental model</a>, it only remained a Gemini Advanced perk for a mere four days before going free.</p><p>So, what does this tell us about Google's AI strategy, and is it even worth paying for Gemini Advanced anymore?</p>

<h2 id="why-gemini-2-5-pro-exp-is-already-available-for-free-users-2">Why Gemini 2.5 Pro (Exp) is already available for free users</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:52.25%;"><img id="uPsBYvCc8XT9ckpz5YjUmX" name="Gemini-2.5-Pro" alt="Gemini 2.5 Pro graphics and benchmark results." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uPsBYvCc8XT9ckpz5YjUmX.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="627" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>ChatGPT has a massive brand advantage over Gemini, to the point that some casual users refer to AI as a whole as just "ChatGPT." However, Google has had the technological edge over OpenAI's large language models (LLMs) for some time now. It's releasing new models at a steady bi-annual pace — sometimes quicker — and Google's latest Gemini 2.5 Pro experimental model is the highest-scoring in multiple AI benchmarks.</p><p>LMArena, a multifaceted AI benchmark, has Gemini 2.5 Pro ranking first on its<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://lmarena.ai/?leaderboard" target="_blank"> leaderboard</a> — ahead of Grok 3, GPT-4.5, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-you-need-to-know-about-deepseek">DeepSeek R1</a>. Google called it the company's "most intelligent AI model" in its announcement of Gemini 2.5 Pro last week, and independent tests appear to back up those claims.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:133.13%;"><img id="jT62sfundccz4jwMuZZwWX" name="Gemini-2.5-Benchmarks" alt="Gemini 2.5 Pro graphics and benchmark results." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jT62sfundccz4jwMuZZwWX.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="2556" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That leads us to why <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-is-gifting-its-best-ai-model-yet-gemini-2-5-pro-exp-to-free-users">Google decided to make Gemini 2.5 Pro experimental free</a> on March 29, just four days after it debuted on March 25. To truly take on ChatGPT, Google can't just convince new users to regularly use Gemini. It also has to try and entice current ChatGPT users to switch to Gemini, and the best way to do that isn't to limit the free tier to outdated models — it's to get the absolute best Gemini models in the hands of the most people.</p><p>Although some Gemini Advanced users may have been caught off guard by the short exclusivity period, Google confirmed this is exactly why it made Gemini 2.5 Pro experimental free in a social media post.</p><p>"The team is sprinting, TPUs are running hot, and we want to get our most intelligent model into more people’s hands asap," the company wrote in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/GeminiApp/status/1906131622736679332" target="_blank">post on X (formerly Twitter)</a> on the Gemini app account. "Which is why we decided to roll out Gemini 2.5 Pro (experimental) to all Gemini users, beginning today."</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Gemini 2.5 Pro is taking off 🚀🚀🚀

The team is sprinting, TPUs are running hot, and we want to get our most intelligent model into more people’s hands asap.

Which is why we decided to roll out Gemini 2.5 Pro (experimental) to all Gemini users, beginning today.

Try it at no… https://t.co/eqCJwwVhXJ<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1906131622736679332">March 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Google's move regarding Gemini 2.5 Pro experimental might seem like a one-off, until you look at past examples of Gemini Advanced features going free. In recent months, numerous paid features have made their way to free users, including Gems — custom versions of Gemini catered to specific tasks. As of March 2025, free users can create their own custom Gemini bots or use pre-made Gems.</p><p>This example is quite important, since it directly challenges OpenAI's custom GPTs. Custom GPTs work similarly to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-might-let-you-share-custom-gems-for-gemini-in-the-mobile-app">Gemini Gems</a>, as they are custom chatbots designed to suit a specific need. However, free ChatGPT users can only try out existing custom GPTs — they can't create their own. Meanwhile, we know that Google is offering similar functionality completely free with Gemini.</p><p>The list of paid Gemini Advanced features made available to free users includes document upload and analysis, image generation of people, Deep Research, and Saved info. Once again, it's worth noting that ChatGPT's version of Deep Research isn't free, potentially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/deep-research-could-be-the-next-gemini-feature-to-hit-free-users-per-report">making the Gemini equivalent a more appealing option</a>.</p>
<h2 id="why-gemini-advanced-still-makes-sense-for-power-users-2">Why Gemini Advanced still makes sense for power users</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="n7fwxQaHoVkMWiPGLvob7B" name="lenovo-chromebook-duet-11-review-13.jpg" alt="Google Gemini app on Lenovo Chromebook Duet 11" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n7fwxQaHoVkMWiPGLvob7B.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google's strategy regarding Gemini is clear: the company wants to deliver more free features than its competitors, all while embedding AI into its existing services — like Google Search, Android, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/march-2025-workspace-feature-drop">Workspace</a>, and YouTube — to gain a competitive edge. But where does that leave Gemini Advanced subscribers?</p><p>Surprisingly, there are still plenty of reasons to subscribe to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One AI Premium</a> for Gemini Advanced access. For starters, Advanced users won't hit rate limits as early as free users. Even if the same models are available to free and paid accounts, Gemini Advanced users will get higher token counts for a larger context window.</p><p>With Gemini 2.5 Pro experimental, paying customers get a one-million-token context window that will expand to two million in the future.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8vYerT9fwUABbyeubwDRcX" name="Gemini-Pro-tokens.jpg" alt="Google Gemini Pro's new token count" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8vYerT9fwUABbyeubwDRcX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A key perk of Gemini Advanced is the higher token support. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That's in addition to all the other Gemini Advanced features that are still exclusive to the subscription, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/notebooklm-guide-ai-hosts-business-pilot-program">NotebookLM</a> — one of the most powerful AI note-taking and research tools available. The same goes for Gemini Live with screen sharing and live video streaming, which is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-is-rolling-out-video-and-screen-sharing-support-for-gemini-live">rolling out to supported Android devices now</a>.</p><p>Google's shocking move of making Gemini 2.5 Pro experimental free just days after its release underscores how important Gemini's unpaid tier is to the company's AI strategy. Somehow, it doesn't come at the expense of Gemini Advanced, either.</p>

For the longest time, scrolling through apps in the app drawer could only be done horizontally, and there was no way to change this other than using a third-party launcher or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-good-lock">Good Lock</a>. Vertical scrolling feels more natural in my opinion, and is the layout most other manufacturers choose to go with.</p><p>Finally, after years of wanting this feature, Samsung has given users a choice in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a>. If you've bought one of the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> phones or have updated your older phone to One UI 7, here's how you can change to a vertical scrolling app drawer.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-change-to-a-vertical-scrolling-app-drawer-on-one-ui-7-2">How to change to a vertical scrolling app drawer on One UI 7</h2>
<p>1. Unlock your phone and open the app drawer.</p><p>2. Tap the <strong>three vertical dots</strong> in the Search box at the bottom, and choose <strong>Sort</strong>.</p><p>3. Tap <strong>Alphabetical order</strong>.</p><p>4. That's it! Your app drawer has been switched to vertical scrolling. When doing it the first time, you'll see an overlay message alerting you to the change in swiping style.</p>

<p>One UI 7 is the latest smartphone software from Samsung, and it comes pre-installed on the Galaxy 25 series. The interface gets a tweaked design, and there are more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> features to play with, some exclusive to the S25 series. The official rollout of One UI 7 for older devices has hit a bit of a snag and didn't make it as promised in the first quarter of 2025. Samsung is still issuing new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-6-galaxy-s24-appears">beta versions of One UI 7 for Galaxy S24</a> owners as we wait for the final build in early April.</p><p>There's not much anyone can do about it, but wait for it. Releasing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/one-ui-7-delayed-because-software-is-hard">software updates is hard</a>, especially when you're Samsung and have more than a hundred models, each with its own variants based on where it's sold in the world. Plenty of due diligence is needed to make sure everything works across its entire portfolio, and rushing a half-baked update will only make things worse.</p><p>New features in One UI 7 that you can expect to arrive on older flagship <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phones</a> include <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-set-up-use-now-bar-samsung-galaxy-phone">Now Bar</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-set-up-and-use-now-brief-on-the-galaxy-s25">Now Brief</a>. Now Bar sits at the bottom of your lockscreen and shows you updates on ongoing activities like music that's playing, live notifications, timers, and more. Now Brief on the other hand offers more detailed personalized briefings based on relevant information. Other features that will cross over include cross-app action, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-use-audio-eraser-on-the-samsung-galaxy-s25">Audio Eraser</a>, Auto Trim, and AI Drawing Assist.</p>

While many of the new changes have been well-received by users and beta testers, there's one exception: the split notification shade and quick settings panel.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/one-ui-7-delayed-because-software-is-hard">One UI 7</a> now behaves like iOS, with a notification shade that can be accessed by swiping down from the left corner of the screen and a separate quick settings panel on the right. For longtime One UI users, this could be a negative change that impacts muscle memory. The good news is that it's easy to reverse the split notification shade and quick settings panel to the unified panel. Let's find out how.</p>
<h2 id="all-the-notification-and-quick-settings-options-in-one-ui-7-2">All the notification and quick settings options in One UI 7</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZpGswcHfE36tUgcaFkrEF6" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-One-UI-7-Beta-2-split-notification-shade" alt="The new split notification pane on One UI 7 beta 2 on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZpGswcHfE36tUgcaFkrEF6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One UI 7 offers two customization options for the notification shade and quick settings panel: <strong>separate</strong> and <strong>together</strong>. Separate is now the default, with together still available as a manual option.</p><p>With the single notification shade and quick settings panel, you can view your most recent notifications and the top level quick settings toggles. There's also an option to edit the top quick settings so that your most-used toggles are easily accessible. To see them all, you can swipe down from the top quick settings one more time.</p><p>While you might expect the option to switch between these preferences to be in the Settings app, it's actually in the panel itself.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-change-back-to-a-single-notification-and-quick-settings-panel-2">How to change back to a single notification and quick settings panel</h2>
<p>1. <strong>Open the Quick Settings menu</strong> by swiping down from the top-right corner of the screen.</p><p>2. Press the <strong>Pencil</strong> icon.</p><p>3. Look for the <strong>Panel settings</strong> button at the top left of your screen, and tap it.</p><p>4. Under <strong>Panel settings</strong> options, tap <strong>Together</strong>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="K2kjttJmqNuQtH9VAqbq6Z" name="Quick-Settings-One-UI-Steps" alt="Steps for changing the Quick Settings menu's location." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/K2kjttJmqNuQtH9VAqbq6Z.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>After that, you'll now see your notification shade and quick settings menu on the same screen. This reflects how previous versions of One UI handled the two, so you're essentially reverting the new One UI 7 default.</p>

<p>Whether you simply prefer a unified notification shade and quick settings panel or are used to the old One UI defaults, there are plenty of reasons to change the One UI 7 preference. A single notification shade and quick settings panel is a One UI staple, and it's one of the things that separates <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung Galaxy phones</a> from iPhones.</p><p>Although some users might be unhappy with the switch, it's great that Samsung provides users with a choice between the two options. You can try out both the split and unified panel and choose the one that you like best on One UI 7.</p>

<hr>
<p>Early signs that Samsung's next watch line up have surfaced in a new leak. While we were focused on Samsung's upcoming foldable line up, the next-gen watches may have quietly passed safety checks.</p><p>Details surrounding batteries that are meant for the next Galaxy Watch 8 series' have allegedly received the SafetyKorea certification and in a separate leak, another tipster on X seems to have spotted firmware builds for these wearables, but more on this later. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.xpertpick.com/mobile/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-batteries-safetykorea-certification/">XpertPick</a>, the next generation of the Galaxy Watch will include two models: the Galaxy Watch 8 and the Galaxy Watch 8 classic.</p><p>First off, two batteries with the codenames <em>EB-BL330ABY and EB-BL505ABY</em>, have been approved by the SafetyKorea authority— as seen in the screenshots below. The publication seems to think that these batteries could be associated with the Galaxy Watch 8 and Galaxy Watch 8 Classic.</p><p>XpertPick also got its hands on the safety certification, indicating that Samsung has sent two products under "Fitness authentication" for safety and compliance certification.</p>

<p>A screenshot posted by XpertPick also spilled beans on the battery capacity of one of these wearables. "The TUV certification has revealed that the EB-BL330ABY battery has a typical capacity of 435mAh." However, we do not have any information on the battery size of the EB-BL505ABY variant.</p><p>Corroborating the fact that the Galaxy Watch 8 series will come as a pair, a user on X revealed information on the supposed firmware that will be built into these wearables. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/theordysm"><strong>Theordysm</strong></a> spotted model numbers <em>SM-L320, SM-L325U, SM-L330, and SM-L335U, </em>which could hint at the different size variants of the Galaxy Watch 8. While <em>SM-L500 and SM-L505 </em>could be associated with the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic variant.</p>

<p>This is the first time we've heard the mention of the Galaxy Watch 8 series in the rumor mill in quite some time. So far, all we've heard was that future Galaxy Watch models, such as the Watch 8, could be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/future-galaxy-watches-may-adopt-apple-watch-squircle-design">ditching the circular design</a> for a more Apple Watch-like squircle look.</p><p>We also sense that this year's watch could bring all the features that didn't make the cut on the Galaxy Watch 7 series, like the rumored blood-glucose monitoring that Samsung claimed to be developing "as early as the second half of 2024," despite previous reports that blood glucose monitoring <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-explores-non-invasive-glucose-monitor">would take a few years to arrive</a>.</p><p>That said, the new Galaxy Watch 8 series is expected to debut later this year along with Samsung's  Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Z Fold 7 at its summer Unpacked event, the publication added.

<ul><li>Google confirmed Gemini Live's new video features won't be exclusive to the latest Android smartphones.</li><li>Project Astra capabilities merely require a device running Android 10 or higher.</li><li>Users will also need Gemini Advanced access, available for $20 per month.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google and Samsung marketed Gemini Live's new Project Astra features as coming to the latest Pixel and Galaxy phones first, but actual compatibility will work with a much wider set of Android devices. An updated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/15274899#:~:text=Share%20your%20camera%20or%20screen%20with%20Live" target="_blank">support document</a> from Google confirms that Gemini Live's video streaming and screen sharing features will work on any Android device running Android 10.0 or newer (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/04/01/gemini-live-camera-any-android/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>The features still require Gemini Advanced, which costs $20 per month as part of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One AI Premium subscription</a>. Aside from that requirement, there are no other limitations for the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini Live</a> features, which are rolling out to devices now.</p><p>"For now, the features below are available on any Android device with Gemini Advanced," the support document reads. "These features are being released gradually, so they might not be available to you just yet."</p><p>Reading between the lines, we can decipher that Gemini Live's video capabilities will work on Android phone, tablet, or foldable running Android 10.0 or higher. The Gemini Advanced requirement means that Android devices must support the Gemini app, which is limited to devices running Android 10 and up.</p>

<p>This includes a wide range of devices, meaning that Gemini's new Project Astra features aren't limited to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Samsung Galaxy S25</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Google Pixel 9 series</a>. With that being said, Google's "for now" qualifier in the support document suggests this could change in the future.</p>

<p>The upcoming Gemini Live features have already hit some Gemini Advanced users, but the rollout is slow thus far. Live video streaming and screen sharing support was first previewed as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/project-astra-joins-gemini-arm-as-google-gears-up-for-public-launch">Project Astra</a>, a research project demoed at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-biggest-announcements">Google I/O 2024</a>. Then, it underwent public beta testing at the end of last year, and a final version was shown off at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-centrals-best-of-mwc-2025">MWC Barcelona 2025</a>.</p><p>Soon, all Gemini Advanced users will be able to go live with Gemini, sharing their surroundings or device screen for additional context.</p>

<p>In particular, one string lists the description of Gemini for kids as helping them "Create stories, get homework help, and more." The strings also include standard notices that Gemini can make mistakes, and that kids' data will be processed per Google's privacy policy and Gemini's Apps Privacy Notice.</p><p>Although Gemini can already help kids with things like homework, it's likely that a future "Gemini for kids" version could include more guardrails and an experience tailored to children. Currently, Google already has certain safeguards in place for younger users, as explained in its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gemini.google/policy-guidelines/?hl=en" target="_blank">Gemini policy guidelines</a>.</p><p>"For teens, we enforce even stricter content policies and default protections to help prevent age-inappropriate content, such as content related to illegal or age-gated substances," Google says.

For now, details are slim, as Google hasn't confirmed plans for a kid-friendly version of Gemini. However, it's worth noting that the company has rolled out many child-friendly features of late, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/kids-with-android-phones-can-now-tap-and-pay-with-google-wallet">Google Wallet for kids</a>.</p>

<hr>
<p>Not all April Fool's pranks are a lost cause. OnePlus took this opportunity to tease its upcoming smaller phone set to join the OnePlus 13 line up, in an April Fools Day video.</p><p>In a post on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5150568143916360#&video">Weibo</a>, OnePlus seems to have confirmed that its long-rumored OnePlus 13T, or as most people call it, the OnePlus 13 Mini, will arrive "later this month."</p><p>OnePlus uploaded a video where it revealed a Thor-like hammer (Mjolnir) as its new product. The presenter seemed to have summoned the hammer on stage and explained its tech powers — obviously hopping on the April Fool's train.</p><p>However, at the end of the video, OnePlus seemingly teased its OnePlus 13T with a poster that shows the signature OnePlus red box and font that closely translates to "Small, beautiful and powerful OnePlus 13T, see you this month.”</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:50.00%;"><img id="Br8iZrzqJ74hAEc2AHWFsP" name="oneplus-13t-teaser-1" alt="screenshot of the OnePlus 13T teaser" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Br8iZrzqJ74hAEc2AHWFsP.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1800" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Weibo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Additionally, the caption of the video on Weibo states that the company will bring back the T-series device with "Top performance, in your hands." OnePlus added that the phone will be an "unprecedented technology product, refreshing your understanding of small and powerful!" This hints that the device could come packed with performance and AI features from the standard OnePlus 13 lineup.</p><p>While the video didn't show us what this device would look like, we have a some idea of what to expect based on recent leaks. Just last month, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/the-oneplus-13t-just-inched-closer-to-launch-with-fresh-details-surfacing">OnePlus 13T surfaced</a>, labeled as PKX110, but it only revealed that the device will come with 80W fast charging.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="BJRg4cA6h7TUHmpwJB4qF7" name="OnePlus-10T-back-black-02.jpg" alt="The back of the OnePlus 10T Moonstone Black colorway" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BJRg4cA6h7TUHmpwJB4qF7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Other leaks suggest the device could sport a smaller 6.3-inch 1.5K flat OLED display and will be powered by<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite"> Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite </a>chip, along with a 6,000mAh battery, much like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>.</p><p>The device's cameras allegedly include a 50MP main sensor and a 50MP telephoto lens with 2x optical zoom. Details about the selfie camera are still unknown. However, the rear camera placement could shift into the vertical array this time around.</p><p>OnePlus is finally bringing back its T-series device after three years when the OnePlus 10T launched in 2022. While we aren't sure how much this phone will cost, it could fall somewhere in between the $600-$900 mark, based on the 13R and the OnePlus 13's cost.</p><p>While the company didn't reveal a launch date for this device, the announcement suggests that the wait won't be long, as the company could continue to drop more hints as the month progresses.</p>

<hr>
<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-127">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Several Google Pixel report threads state a few past-gen devices are suffering from inaccurate weather forecasts via the Pixel weather widget.</li><li>Users state the widget is displaying the correct temperature; however, the forecast throughout the day belongs to a previous day.</li><li>Some believe there's a desync issue that is simply not rectifying itself as users have suffered these issues for the past few days.</li><li>Following the March feature drop, Pixel users have suffered from various issues ranging from odd screen brightness to disappearing alarms.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google's weather widget is causing some confusion for Pixel users following a recent string of oddities.</p><p>As usual, Pixel owners took to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1jn30ns/how_many_others_are_getting_1day_old_weather/?rdt=51996">respective subreddit</a> to start voicing issues, which reportedly include day-old weather forecasts (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-pixels-weather-widget-stuck-in-the-past/">Android Police</a>). The issue seemed to be quite persistent for the original poster of the thread on Reddit; however, other subsequent user reports expand on it. One <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1jn30ns/comment/mkgs35i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">user responded</a> by saying their Pixel has been delivering inaccurate weather forecasts "for the past three days."</p><p>Another user, who also reported the issue a couple of days ago, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://old.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1jlu1uf/google_weather_at_a_glance_temperature_forecast/">states this issue</a> has been consistent on Pixels running Android 13, 14, and 15. Of course, this concerns devices with the "At a glance" weather information readily available. The user says the current temperature is correct, but "the expected high/low forecast hasn't been correct in the past week."</p><p>Then, strangely, opening the Pixel weather app fully displays everything as it should be. It's an odd back and forth between accurate temps to inaccurate forecasts, which only solve themselves when opening the full app.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1jlu1uf/google_weather_at_a_glance_temperature_forecast">Google Weather At A Glance Temperature Forecast - Never Accurate</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel">r/GooglePixel</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>Users have reported these issues on Pixel 7 devices and a Pixel 8a, as seen in a Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/334229425/pixel-8a-lock-screen-showing-weather-forecast-for-the-wrong-day?hl=en">community thread</a>. The post states the user had observed inaccurate weather forecasts, which showed the wrong day, on their lock screen. The user details the problem, stating, "In the morning, it shows yesterday's forecast as the temperature 'today,' and in the evening, it shows today's forecast as the weather 'tomorrow.'"</p><p>The problem doesn't appear to involve the Pixel 9 series, but you never know. It's something to keep an eye on as Google has yet to officially acknowledge the issue. As some users suspect, it <em>could </em>be an odd sync issue with the Pixel weather app widget. Hopefully, it begins to solve itself to avoid further confusion.</p>

<p>There's been no shortage of troubles for Google's Pixels as, following its March feature drop, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-owners-report-march-security-patch-problems">major issues have been appearing</a>. Pixel 7 to Pixel 9 series owners were reportedly suffering from brightness fluctuations, audio issues, and vibration problems following the big update. Google responded to those issues, stating it was aware and looking into the problem, as well as offering some temporary solutions.</p><p>Elsewhere, Pixel owners were <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-users-late-start-alarm-issues-reported">getting to a late start</a> last week as their alarms were deactivating themselves. Scheduled alarms were simply disappearing, leaving many users late for work without realizing their Pixel did it on its own. Some blame the March feature drop, while others think it was Gemini.</p><p>It's unclear if the same major patch is the culprit for the recent Pixel weather problems. There's a chance Google may have to fix some things on its end for those affected.</p>

<hr>
<p>A recent report suggests Samsung is looking into a new type of battery technology for its next smart ring.</p><p>A report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.mt.co.kr/mtview.php?no=2025040113515370007">Money Today</a> (Korean) claims Samsung will apply an "all-solid-state battery" technology inside the next Galaxy Ring (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sammyguru.com/samsung-plans-all-solid-state-batteries-for-wearables-like-galaxy-ring/">SammyGuru</a>). The publication states this tech, dubbed the "Dream Battery," consists of "solid electrolytes," which reportedly reduces the "risk of fire." However, there are two important sides to this type of battery. The first is positive, as all-solid-state batteries are said to hold more energy for devices.</p><p>In theory (and if true), this might give the next Galaxy Ring a longer battery life — though it can already last <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review#section-battery-and-charging:~:text=My%20Galaxy%20Ring%20lasted%206%2D7%20full%20days%20on%20any%20given%20charge.">roughly a week</a>. The report speculates that Samsung could take the battery's maximum energy capacity even higher when it looks to (potentially) bring it to the second Galaxy Ring.</p><p>The second is its application. Rumors claim that implementing this new battery technology into the next Galaxy Ring could drive up its cost. The post highlights that manufacturing such a battery is "much more" expensive than settling for a lithium-ion alternative. What's more, the poor performance of the Galaxy Ring sales-wise is supposedly a hurdle Samsung is still paying attention to when considering this battery type.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="9wPj8zFQaSiTVnHX45ETkj" name="samsung-galaxy-ring-in-case" alt="Samsung Galaxy Ring in charging case with lid open" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9wPj8zFQaSiTVnHX45ETkj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For now, Samsung is rumored to apply prototypes of this tech to the next Galaxy Ring "in the fourth quarter this year." Meanwhile, the report's alleged sources claim Samsung will also look to bring these dream batteries to earbuds in 2026 and a future Galaxy Watch in "late 2027."</p><p>Regarding Samsung's popularity concerns, when the Galaxy Ring launched last summer (July), the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-cant-ship-the-galaxy-ring-fast-enough-shows-how-theyre-an-in-thing">struggled to keep up</a> with demand. A report showed the Galaxy Ring sold out in just a few days prior to its official reveal/launch during Unpacked. When pre-orders opened again, the company had to deliver longer wait times for certain sizes as they weren't readily available. While this lasted for a few weeks during the summer, as the Korean publication highlights, it didn't last long.</p><p>As consumers got over the initial hype, and likely as more reviews came to light, things quieted.</p><p>Galaxy Ring 2 rumors have been scarce, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-ring-2-new-enhancements-launch-rumored">one claimed</a> in November that Samsung could provide it with an increased battery life and a thinner profile. It's remained unknown just how thin the ring could be next time. Elsewhere, it seems Samsung is looking to bring even more features to its next smart ring as the original may have felt a little lackluster.</p><p>It's also unclear when Samsung could debut <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-2">the next Galaxy Ring</a>; however, we're hopeful that something shows up during its summer Unpacked this year.</p>

<p>Google is highlighting a new challenge for users in London looking to take the tube throughout April.</p><p>Transport for London (Tfl) and Google Pay have joined together to bring the "Tube Challenge" to London. According to a press release, the event runs from March 31 through April 30. The company says users are eligible to win prizes and badges when using Google Pay for Android specifically. In a subsequent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://madeby.tfl.gov.uk/2025/03/31/google-pay-tube-challenge/">blog post</a>, the Tfl explains how users can get started this month.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started-2">Getting Started</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1197px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="eFDFBPhyetzjofs4GMQ4QJ" name="google-pay-tlf-london-tube-challenge-collect" alt="Google Pay joins the Tfl is bringing the "Tube Challenge" to users in London." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eFDFBPhyetzjofs4GMQ4QJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1197" height="673" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The post states users in London will have a chance to join the challenge from within Google Wallet. The Tfl encourages you to attach your Visa or Mastercard to the app "and start tapping in and out with Google Pay on your adventures."</p><p>These digital badges you're playing for will be collected as you tap to pay at various Tube stations. Google says travelers can collect these badges from all 272 Tube stations, including the 41 Elizabeth line stations. Alongside these badges are some fun facts about every station you may visit.</p><p>That's not all; as Google states train riders engaging with Google Pay for the Tube challenge are also entered into a weekly competition to win Santander Cycles Day Passes. However, during the final week, users tapping in and out of London stations will be eligible to win a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Google Pixel 9</a>. Remember: you earn an entry into these two raffles every day you take the Tube and engage with Google Pay.</p>

<p>In a statement, the customer director at the Tfl, Emma Strain, said, "We are excited to partner with Google Pay on their ‘Tube Challenge’ within Google Wallet. This innovative challenge offers customers a fun and engaging way to explore the Tube and Elizabeth line network, collect digital station badges, and learn facts about the places they are travelling to across London."</p><p>It's worth remembering that the Google Pay app — on its own — is no more, as the company shuttered it and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-supports-42-additional-banks">packed it into Google Wallet</a>. The app was officially shuttered as of June 4, 2024. The idea of paying via Google Pay still exists as its core functions are within Google Wallet. Additionally, places will still say they accept payment via the method, so it's not gone; it's just been moved.</p><p>To get people ready, Google brought support for a host of banks to its Wallet app early last year. Many of them were small banks, but the idea was likely to include as many of its users as possible to make the transition smooth. Since then, the company (in the U.S.) has moved to bring <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-to-expand-digital-drivers-license-support">digital ID support for state IDs</a>.</p><p>California <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-adds-digital-id-support-in-yet-another-us-state">joined the movement</a>, as well as Arizona, Georgia, and a few others.</p>

Ordering the phone directly from Samsung could earn you a bunch of trade-in credit, but if you prefer the simplicity of buying unlocked, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Unlocked-Smartphone-Manufacturer-Warranty/dp/B0DYQH3FZ4"><strong>order the Galaxy A36 5G from Best Buy or Amazon and get a free $50 gift card</strong>,</a> no strings attached.

<p>Do you want the experience of using the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">best Samsung phones</a> without spending over 500 bucks? The new Galaxy A36 5G might be the answer, boasting (nearly) flagship-level specs and clocking in at just $399.99.

<p>Surely destined to earn a spot among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best cheap Android phones</a> released this year, the Samsung Galaxy A36 5G impresses with a stunning 6.7-inch AMOLED display that boasts a 120Hz refresh rate, while the 5,000mAh battery will easily last a full day on a single charge. </p><p>You&apos;ll also enjoy solid performance from the Exynos chipset, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a>, and a pared-down version of Galaxy AI (known as "Awesome Intelligence", per Samsung). Furthermore, the Galaxy A36 5G comes with six years of guaranteed software updates, which is a first for Samsung&apos;s budget-minded A series. </p><p>Priced in between Samsung&apos;s flagships and even-cheaper models like the Galaxy A16, one could argue that the A36 5G suffers from a bit of middle child syndrome. After all, if you&apos;re willing to spend a bit more, you could get an arguably better phone like the OnePlus 13R, the upcoming Pixel 9a, or even the Galaxy S25 (with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-deals-of-the-month">right phone deal</a>). But if you&apos;re already a fan of Samsung&apos;s bestselling A series and you want a new phone right away, this deal could get you exactly what you need (plus a free gift card to boot).</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-teaser">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge</a> has been at the centre of several leaks recently and for good reason, it looks like. A Dutch website seems to have gotten its hands on when this device could potentially see the light of day.</p><p>According to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nieuwemobiel.nl/041212/24519/Exclusief-Dit-is-de-lanceerdatum-van-de-Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge.html">NieuweMobiel.NL</a> (Netherlands website), the sleek phone will allegedly launch on April 15 in Europe — a day earlier than what the previous leaks have been pointing to. Additionally, the publication stated that the phone will be released in three colorways and two storage variants while also listing their supposed model numbers:</p><p><em>256GB Silver: SM-S937BZSD</em></p><p><em>512GB Silver: SM-S937BZSG</em></p><p><em>256GB Black: SM-S937BZKD</em></p><p><em>512GB Black: SM-S937BZKG</em></p><p><em>256GB Blue: SM-S937BLBD</em></p><p><em>512GB Blue: SM-S937BLBG</em></p><p>According to NieuweMobeil.NL, all S25 Edge models come with 12GB of RAM, similar to the rest of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 series</a>.</p>

<p>Recently, we got a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/new-leak-shows-off-samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-in-titanium-variants" target="_blank">good peek</a> at those colorways as official-looking renders popped up on the internet. They show off the Galaxy S25 Edge in a Titanium build and the three colors that match the Galaxy S25 Ultra: "Titanium Jet Black," "Titanium Silver," and "Titanium Icy Blue."</p><p>Samsung wasn't being too secretive about the upcoming addition to the S25 series since it openly showed off the device first at this year's Unpacked and later more vividly at the MWC in Barcelona, where the phones were hung from the ceiling suspended by metallic ropes.</p><p>We now know what the phone will look like, however when it comes to the specs of the phone, here's what we know so far. To start, the Galaxy S25 Edge is said to be 5.84mm thin, showcasing a titanium body and an Armor Aluminum frame. The phone could have a 6.7-inch QHD+ dynamic AMOLED display powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset</a>.</p><p>Additionally, it is said to come with a smaller 3,900mAh battery compared to the rest of the Galaxy S25 series (with some rumors pointing to a 4,000mAh unit), although we won't know for sure until it launches.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4093px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="AbNKAdLaHp9MFRMAf8UzE4" name="Samsung-GAlaxy-S25-Edge-MWC-2025-3" alt="The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge on display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AbNKAdLaHp9MFRMAf8UzE4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4093" height="2302" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As seen in several images, the phone will have two rear cameras. They will likely consist of a primary 200MP lens and a 12MP lens for ultra-wide shots, along with a selfie camera, which we don't have much information about.</p><p>When it comes to protecting these expensive phones, the Dutch website dropped some images of accessories that the Korean OEM is expected to release. The news website was able to find two Galaxy S25 Edge cases — a silicone case and a Kindsuit Case that showcased several color variations, with their supposed model numbers: <strong>Samsung EF-PS937CJ Silicone Case S25 Edge Gray </strong>and <strong>Samsung EF-VS937PL Kindsuit Case S25 Edge Blue</strong>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1172px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:85.32%;"><img id="L8ocQeeJgw4gUhRNL7jr4N" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-Cases" alt="Cases of the alleged Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/L8ocQeeJgw4gUhRNL7jr4N.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1172" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: NieuweMobiel.NL)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We also hear that the phones could be on the expensive side, with the 256GB model costing €1,200–€1,300 ($1,300–$1,400), while the 512GB version might hit €1,300–€1,400 ($1,400–$1,520).</p><p>As we near launch, the leaks seem to be coming in hot. However, it is important to note that everything we see in leaks may or may not show up on the actual device. If the Dutch website's information holds true, then the wait isn't for much longer.</p>

<p>As I pulled the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra out of my pocket, an unfamiliar friction met my fingers. This wasn't the matte glass texture that I'm used to feeling from Samsung's latest flagship. No, instead, was it the coarse texture of a brush or, dare I suggest it, <em>turf grass</em>?</p><p>Indeed, it was the feeling of the latest DBrand skin drop, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://dbrand.com/touch-grass"><strong>Touch Grass</strong></a>, which allows you to place your very own little field of dreams on your favorite device. The company says over 100 devices are supported for this limited edition drop, and while it is an April Fool's joke of sorts, DBrand is actually selling this limited edition set of skins to willing customers (so get it while it lasts!).</p><p>Given how much I've loved Dbrand's previous limited edition drops — like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/dbrand-leather-skin-review">the leather one</a> — I couldn't pass up the opportunity to touch grass and see how it felt, so I got a pack for a few phones in my possession and hastily installed them. If you're a nerd who's ever been told to "touch grass," this might be the perfect opportunity without having to go outside to do it.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9gKi4p9Df2nQKZsMGQHYbf" name="dbrand-grass-skin-2025-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-05" alt="The green Touch Grass DBrand skin on the back of a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9gKi4p9Df2nQKZsMGQHYbf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Despite the unique texture, the DBrand Touch Grass skin installs the same way as any other DBrand skin. You'll use the included microfiber cloth to wipe off any grease or smudges on the back of your phone, peel off a portion of the 3M paper on the back of the grass skin, align it with the camera modules, and then slowly peel back the rest of the 3M paper as you press the skin's adhesive back onto the phone's glass surface.</p><p>Unlike some of the full-coverage skins, the Touch Grass skin doesn't require a hair dryer for application. Instead, you'll just use the included microfiber cloth to rub the edges 15-20 times until they "melt" into the edge. This works particularly well with any phone that has a flat back and a slightly raised lip around the edge, as it'll help conceal the edge of the skin so you don't accidentally peel it off with a fingernail.</p>

<p>The skin is thicker than most DBrand skins because of the raised grass texture, which comprises thousands of electrostatically flocked polyethylene strands. Dbrand told me that flocking — a process that "shoots hyper-thin strands into adhesive and has them stand up like actual grass" — was the only method the company could find to fit the vision for the product properly.</p><p>"There were definitely 'fuzz' alternatives that we took one look at and abandoned. They were more akin to moss than they were actual strands of grass," DBrand CEO Adam Ijaz told me.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZA2sAYFgZx3hkqF86c7iQ4" name="dbrand-grass-skin-2025-close" alt="A close-up of the texture on the DBrand Touch Grass skin" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZA2sAYFgZx3hkqF86c7iQ4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A mixture of green and yellow colors scattered throughout gives it a strangely natural look on the back of a wholly synthetic device, and it adds some <strong>serious</strong> grip to an otherwise slippery glass and metal sandwich of a phone.</p><p>The coarse grass texture reminds me quite a bit of one of those little brushes you use to clean the underside of your fingernails. It's not unpleasantly coarse but it does have a texture that could be irritating to sensitive skin. This isn't soft, natural spring grass. Thankfully, DBrand has ensured that it's a dry-feeling texture, not the slimy plastic you might be familiar with when you hear "turf grass."</p>

<p>As it has a significantly grippier texture than matte glass, this one will hold fast in your pocket even if you decide to do a handstand. How do I know that? I did it, of course. It'll also probably make your pocket go inside out every time you pull it out, especially if you wear shorts or pants with mesh pockets.</p>

<p>So this skin can finally make phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro</a> <em>not slippery</em>, but what else can it do? Eliminate wobble on phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>. One of the worst smartphone trends in recent years is the obnoxiously large camera lenses that are placed off-center on the back of phones. That makes them wobble when you put them down on a table.</p><p>But this skin completely fixes that, and it even makes it so the phone doesn't slide off a slightly slanted surface. As you might expect, adding the Touch Grass skin will make it impossible to use a case with your phone. If this is a concern, DBrand has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://dbrand.com/shop/grip">its own line of cases</a> that are built to be used with its skins, as you'll put the skin <em>on the case</em> instead of your phone.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-vegan-leather-phones">I hate glass phones</a>. I'm not sure what genius thought covering a smartphone in breakable glass was a good idea, but here we are. Sure, it made things like waterproofing and wireless charging easier for a time, but those days are behind us, and I hope to see more phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> that recognize this.</p><p>Motorola's entire lineup, from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-2025-review" target="_blank">$200 Moto G 2025</a> to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review" target="_blank">$999 Motorola Razr Plus 2024</a>, is clad in different grades of "vegan leather." Vegan leather can be made of anything from pieces of plastic to cactus leaves, each base material giving the final product a different texture. Phones like the Spring Green Razr 2024 or the Midnight Ocean OnePlus 13 use a very soft, cloth-like texture that feels less like leather and more like a suede shoe.</p><p>I definitely prefer that sort of smooth texture as it not only provides much-needed grip to modern phone designs but also removes a breakable surface. These phones don't use some kind of skin adhered to a layer of glass. Instead, this texture is factory-applied to a non-glass backplate and tucked behind the side frame, ensuring it will never peel off. These have also proven to be just as durable, if not more durable, than glass over time, earning phones like the OnePlus 13 a rare IP69 water and dust ingress rating.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Manufacturers are finally ditching glass and using interesting textures like vegan leather that have proven more durable over time.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>As for DBrand's limited edition Touch Grass skin, Ijaz ensured me that it was made for daily wear and tear.</p><p>"The biggest one was definitely around durability - especially at the edges. Early in development, we found that our traditional die-cutting method produced clean lines but led to grass strands gradually shedding from the edges (think: receding hairline).</p><p>To solve this, we switched to laser cutting. The laser's heat effectively melts (cauterizes) and seals the polyethylene strands at the perimeter, bonding them together to prevent shedding over time. Additionally, embedding each strand securely into an adhesive base layer (covering about 25% of its height) was critical in ensuring long-term stability. Balancing the novelty factor with real-world usability was an interesting challenge, but we're pleased with how well it turned out."</p><p>Of course, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/late-2024-led-flicker-research-smartphones">with some other things</a>, some of the biggest brand names simply aren't doing anything interesting in this area. The bright side is that if you've got an iPhone, Samsung Galaxy, or Google Pixel phone, you can order a DBrand skin to mostly fix this problem. It might still be glass underneath, but at least the outside won't feel like a slippery, breakable surface anymore when you slap a skin on it.</p>

<h2 id="dbrand-s-april-fools-legacy-2">Dbrand’s April Fools’ legacy</h2>
<p>Dbrand has a history of using April Fools’ Day to drop some pretty wild ideas, and today’s launch is no different. Back in 2022, the company introduced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://dbrand.com/shop/limited-edition/diy-kit?srsltid=AfmBOoqXq7VEa_Ruaow8WjNWKKwej2UJ_Xor2Bd5MXUGDTJ8xCiMi6fA" target="_blank">DIY skins</a>, letting people cut their own vinyl wraps. The "Deluxe" kit came with a 2x3 vinyl sheet, some fancy Japanese tools (a ruler and a knife), and a nearly $100 price tag. Meanwhile, the budget-friendly "Classic" version was just a tiny 1x1 vinyl square for $25. It was perfect for covering, well, not much.</p><p>As for the new grass-like skins, Dbrand says they were actually supposed to drop last April, but making fake grass feel real at a microscopic level turned out to be way harder "than coming up with the product name."</p><p>Bringing this concept to life wasn’t easy, as per the company's press release. Dbrand had to figure out how to electrostatically apply polyethylene fibers and cut them cleanly without making a mess.</p>
<h2 id="remember-that-creepy-skin-phone-case-2">Remember that creepy skin phone case?</h2>
<p>Speaking of weird phone cases, researcher Marc Teyssier from Télécom ParisTech created <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://marcteyssier.com/projects/skin-on/" target="_blank">Skin-On</a> back in 2019. It was a creepy but fascinating touch interface that felt like human skin.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bqXMVeEfpaWPpMsaKx7L7A" name="Touch-Grass-Xbox" alt="Dbrand Touch Grass skin for Xbox" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bqXMVeEfpaWPpMsaKx7L7A.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Dbrand)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This unsettling innovation lets phones, wearables, and touchpads react to different kinds of touch, making interactions a little too lifelike. The prototype responded to both pressure and touch sensations, but it never made it to market.</p><p>On the other hand, Dbrand takes these wild ideas and turns them into real products—like the Doomsday Kit and The DIY Project. While their approach is full of satire, it leads to actual, purchasable items.</p>

<ul><li>Google Maps is streamlining trip details, making the interface cleaner and more focused on key information.</li><li>The ETA now pops up bigger and bolder in a split, left-aligned display, making it the star of the show.</li><li>The redesign is live across all transport modes in version 25.13.06, but it’s server-side, so your experience might differ.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google Maps is tightening up the way trip details show up on screen, making everything cleaner and packed with just the right information.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/31/google-maps-directions-redesign/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a> has spotted a new design in the directions overview, where the color-coded ETA now pops up bigger on a split, left-aligned display. This makes that key information stand out more.</p><p>Before the update, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/15-best-google-maps-tips-and-tricks-you-need-know">Google Maps</a> crammed all your trip details—including time and distance—into three tight lines at the bottom of the screen. Both the hours and miles got the same plain text treatment, while half the space sat empty like unused trail.</p>
<h2 id="eta-gets-the-spotlight-2">ETA gets the spotlight</h2>
<p>The redesign gives the interface a modern feel with a cleaner information layout. While the distance is still there, it takes a backseat, making room for extra details like the ETA. Now, users can easily see things like fuel efficiency and, most importantly, their expected arrival time.</p><p>Previously, on Android, Google Maps gives a quick look at distance and travel time affected by traffic in the overview. To see more information, like parking or toll costs, you have to either expand the overview or tap the menu. But that’s changing with this update.</p>

<p>The visual redesign rolls out across all transport modes in Google Maps, starting with version 25.13.06. While 9to5Google reports a broad rollout, it’s still activated server-side, so the experience may vary for different users.</p><p>Sure, the new layout takes some getting used to. But comparing the old and new designs shows a clear appreciation for Google's improved look. At the end of the day though, we're all just along for the ride - it's not like Google is giving us a vote in the redesign.</p>

<hr>
<p>Caught you off guard; Nothing is announcing a brand new product reveal that'll give you a bit of nostalgia.</p><p>Today (Apr. 1), Nothing unveiled its latest audio product for its Ear lineup dubbed the Ear 3.5mm. If you've ever felt like you wanted to take a step back to wired earphones that deliver unparallel sound, this could be for you. The Nothing Ear 3.5mm features a jack for its respective port on your smartphone or other eligible device.</p><p>Additionally, the device is boasts Nothing's "signature style" for the in-ear part. Users will notice the company's expected transparent design, as well as a large hoop that's meant to go around your ear to ensure it remains in place. Amazingly, the Nothing Ear 3.5mm features a generous 50mm cable, which means you can get a load of housework done while staying connected.</p><p>Nothing ends its reveal with the tagline "Uninterrupted, untangled, unbelievable freedom."</p>

<p>Nothing didn't provide a market release date nor any information on pre-orders for the Ear 3.5mm —<em><strong>because this isn't a real product! April Fools! </strong></em></p><p>Aside from calling its latest product "beautifully inconvenient," it might've seemed odd that Nothing would — out of nowhere — offer an incredibly lengthy cord attached to the base of its Ear Open.</p><p>If you're looking for some "real" earphones, Nothing's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/nothing-ear-open-review">Ear Open</a> buds launched last fall (don't worry, they're wireless) and flaunted a different approach to the earphone design. Nothing opted for an "open" approach to the earbuds, which feature a wide ear loop, designed to go over your ears, not inside. Despite that, Android Central's Tshaka Armstrong said in his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/nothing-ear-open-review">review</a> that the buds surprisingly feature quite a bit of bass.</p><p>In other news, the Nothing OS 3.1 update <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-phone-3a-3a-pro-essential-key-update-3-1">is rolling out</a> for the  Phone 3a and 3a Pro which adds a major feature to Essential Key. It now works with the camera app, letting users directly save photos to their Essential Space with written or voice notes.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-162">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google could be working on a home screen widget for the Pixel Screenshots app.</li><li>The widget, in its early form, will only display your latest screenshot on the home screen for quick access to sharing or editing.</li><li>Right now, the widget is pretty basic—just one screenshot with no customization or resizing options.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is reportedly working on a home screen widget for the Pixel Screenshots app, which uses AI <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-the-pixel-screenshots-app-on-the-google-pixel-9">to organize and search your screenshots</a>.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-screenshots-widget-3539965/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, the Pixel Screenshots app might soon get widget support. In its early version, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Google Pixel 9</a>-exclusive widget would show your latest screenshot right on the home screen. You’ll be able to tap on it to share or edit the image directly.</p><p>The widget is pretty limited for now, though. It just shows one screenshot with no options for customizing the content. You can’t resize it either. Its description, "See the latest screenshot and [its] associated action," really highlights how it's all about quick, fixed access.</p>

<h2 id="more-than-just-storing-screenshots-2">More than just storing screenshots</h2>
<p>For those who haven't come across it yet, the Pixel 9-exclusive Pixel Screenshots is an app that turns your screenshots into something useful. First shown off at the 2024 Made by Google event, it’s since been integrated with various Google apps, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-screenshots-circle-to-search-development-spotted">such as Circle to Search</a>, Gboard, and Google Wallet.</p><p>Thanks to Google's Gemini Nano AI, the app automatically sorts through your screenshots and actually understands what's in them. That means you can search for text, dates, or even specific details across all your saved images.</p><p>Despite this discovery, the latest version of the Pixel Screenshots app doesn’t yet support widgets. However, it’s likely that a future update will bring widget support, along with more features and customization options.</p><p>Even without the widget, the Pixel Screenshots app does more than just store images. Its AI pulls out key data—like text, timestamps, and important details—and organizes them into collections that you can easily manage, filter, or add to.</p>

<ul><li>Google will launch a new battery preservation feature, Battery health assistance, later this year.</li><li>The Google Pixel 9a is the only device currently confirmed to be getting the new feature.</li><li>New devices will be required to use Battery health assistance, but it'll be optional for existing ones.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-9a-finally-gets-a-launch-date-">Google's Pixel 9a will hit shelves April 10</a>, packing a significantly-larger battery capacity than its predecessor. However, that's not the only battery upgrade the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a">Pixel 9a</a> brings along. The Google Pixel 9a will also receive with a new feature called "Battery health assistance," as explained by a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/15738128?hl=en" target="_blank">support document</a> linked on its Google Store listing (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/31/pixel-battery-health-assistance/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>"Your Pixel 9a will receive a software update that automatically helps manage the long term health and performance of its battery as it ages," the company explains. "This software will adjust the battery’s maximum voltage in stages that start at 200 charge cycles and continue gradually until 1000 charge cycles to help stabilize battery performance and aging."</p><p>For those that are unfamiliar, Pixel phones — like most electronics — use lithium-ion batteries that are consumable components. That means they will degrade over time due to a number of factors, including temperature, charge cycles, and age. Eventually, all lithium-ion batteries will need to be replaced.</p><p>There are steps that can be taken to preserve the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-check-android-phone-battery-health">long-term health of your phone's battery</a> and overall performance, though. These can include intentionally throttling a device's performance to accommodate battery degradation as it gets older, or limiting charge speeds and maximum charge levels. Battery health assistance will join the ranks of battery-preserving features in a later update, Google says.</p>

<p>"You may notice small decreases in your battery’s runtime as your battery ages," the company writes. "Battery health assistance will also tune the phone’s charging speed based on adjusted capacity. You may notice a slight change in battery charging performance."</p><p>For now, the Pixel 9a is the only device confirmed to get this feature when it launches later this year. However, it's expected to come to more devices. These features aren't user-customizable.</p><p>"Battery health assistance is a software feature that will roll out to a selection of Pixel devices starting later this year, designed to extend their usability," Google told 9to5Google in a statement. The company also said Battery health assistance "will be voluntary for any customers using previously launched devices."</p><p>This feature isn't available now, and doesn't have a set release date. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> is expected to bring along a<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/pixel-phones-might-finally-introduce-battery-health-feature-with-android-16"> few other battery health tools for Pixels</a> later this year.</p>

<p>Google announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-2-5-pro-is-googles-latest-ai-model-with-thinking-and-multimodality-built-in">Gemini 2.5 Pro experimental</a> less than a week ago, and it's already rolling out to free users on the web, plus the Gemini apps for Android and iOS. When the company revealed the early version of Gemini 2.5 Pro on March 25, it was exclusive to Gemini Advanced subscribers. That exclusivity period didn't last long, as Google extended its best experimental model to free users by Saturday, March 29.</p><p>"Gemini 2.5 Pro is taking off," the company wrote in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/GeminiApp/status/1906131622736679332" target="_blank">post on X (formerly Twitter)</a> on the Gemini app account. "The team is sprinting, TPUs are running hot, and we want to get our most intelligent model into more people’s hands asap.

The team is sprinting, TPUs are running hot, and we want to get our most intelligent model into more people’s hands asap.

Which is why we decided to roll out Gemini 2.5 Pro (experimental) to all Gemini users, beginning today.

Try it at no… https://t.co/eqCJwwVhXJ<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1906131622736679332">March 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>There are still crucial advantages for Gemini Advanced subscribers. Google says that rate limits will apply to free Gemini users, whole Gemini Advanced users "have expanded access and a significantly larger context window." For now, Gemini 2.5 Pro experimental has a one-million-token context window that will double in the future. These features are available as part of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One AI Premium subscription</a>, which costs $20 per month.</p><p>Gemini 2.5 Pro launched at the top many of the benchmarks and leaderboards for large language models (LLMs), including LMArena, where it is still the top-ranking chatbot as of today. Google originally explained that it developed Gemini 2.5 Pro by "combining a significantly enhanced base model with improved post-training."</p>

<p>Presumably, Google wants to get Gemini 2.5 Pro experimental — its best AI model yet — in the hands of more users. While still an experimental model, Gemini 2.5 Pro has support for file uploads, extensions, and Canvas. It currently lacks a few features, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/deep-research-could-be-the-next-gemini-feature-to-hit-free-users-per-report">Deep Research</a> mode.</p><p>It's unclear whether the final version of Gemini 2.5 Pro will also be made available to free users in a limited fashion.</p>
