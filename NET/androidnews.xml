                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>There are few consumer tech products that are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-is-the-most-exciting-phone-around">as interesting as the Mate XT</a>; Huawei somehow managed to create a tri-folding design that actually holds up to daily use, and the device gives us a great preview of where foldables are headed. There are so many things to like in the Mate XT; it is the thinnest foldable you can buy today, with Huawei outmatching the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">Find N5</a> in this regard.</p><p>The phone has unmatched flexibility; you can use it as a regular slab phone, a fold-out device, or a full-fledged 10.2-inch tablet, and I switched between all three modes extensively in the two months I had the foldable. The internals aren't quite on par with the best that Qualcomm has to offer, but I didn't run into any slowdowns as such, and the battery life is fantastic considering the sheer size of the device.</p><p>But the most impressive feature has to be the cameras; most foldables have a camera system that doesn't measure up to traditional flagships, and this is one of the main reasons why I still haven't switched to one as my daily driver. I enjoyed using the Find N5, but it doesn't deliver the same caliber of photos as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/oppo-find-x8-ultra-review">Find X8 Ultra</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a>.</p>
<p>This is where the Mate XT has a distinct advantage; Huawei put its best imaging modules into the device, and the foldable easily pulls ahead of every other device in this category. I tested it against the Find N5, and there's no question that Huawei did a stellar job with both photos and videos. What's interesting is that the Mate XT manages to hold its own against the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-ultra-review">Xiaomi 15 Ultra</a>, and that is an achievement in and of itself.</p>

<p>The Mate XT produced photos with accurate color rendition; it was an overcast day, and the foldable did a good job highlighting that. The Find N5 has cooler colors, and it had issues with shadows, often failing to deliver the same level of detail around the edges.</p>
<iframe allow="" height="480" width="100%" data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=e4c52042-295a-11f0-bb23-0936e1cb08fb"></iframe>
<p>Both foldables did a decent job in this image, but once again, the Find N5 has increased contrast and saturation, and it doesn't quite have the same accuracy. It also loses out on detail when you zoom in to the image.</p>

<p>You get great versatility with the Mate XT as well, and the phone delivers the same caliber of photos with the wide-angle and tele lenses. The wide-angle camera has a greater field of view, and it produces better quality of photos than the Find N5.</p>
<iframe allow="" height="480" width="100%" data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=ff332a5a-295a-11f0-bb23-0936e1cb08fb"></iframe>
<p>Similarly, the Mate XT did a good job preserving color balance at 2x and 5.5x zoom, and you get a good amount of detail.</p>
<iframe allow="" height="480" width="100%" data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=4c6922f2-295b-11f0-bb23-0936e1cb08fb"></iframe>
<p>The biggest difference is with portrait shots; in this photo, the Mate XT got all the details right and correctly blurred out the background while having both phones visible, and it took several tries to get a similar result on the Find N5.</p>
<iframe allow="" height="480" width="100%" data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=65224cec-295b-11f0-bb23-0936e1cb08fb"></iframe>
<p>In a similar vein, the Mate XT does a great job in low-light situations, producing consistent colors and managing highlights well.</p>
<p>What's notable is how well the phone holds up against the Xiaomi 15 Ultra, which has one of the strongest camera packages of any 2025 device.</p>
<iframe allow="" height="480" width="100%" data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=9b0a38ec-295b-11f0-bb23-0936e1cb08fb"></iframe>

<p>Xiaomi does a better job overall as the sensor is able to take in greater light, and the brand's camera tuning delivers cleaner photos with great vibrancy. That said, the Mate XT is pretty close, and that is praiseworthy.</p>
<iframe allow="" height="480" width="100%" data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=b7aab6e8-295b-11f0-bb23-0936e1cb08fb"></iframe>

<p>The differences between the two is diminished in low-light scenarios, particularly when using the wide-angle lens.</p>

<p>On the whole, Huawei did an incredible job with the Mate XT. While the main attraction is clearly the panel that unfolds to a 10.2-inch tablet, the cameras and great battery life turn it into a fantastic daily driver. Yes, it is the costliest phone around — by a significant amount — but the device is an all-rounder like no other.</p>

<ul><li>Android now natively supports OpenID standards for digital credential presentation and issuance.</li><li>Users can securely store and send cryptographically verifiable digital documents across different apps.</li><li>This update enables wider use of digital credentials for various purposes, including account recovery and identity verification on different platforms.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google recently expanded its Digital ID access through its Wallet app for residents in the U.K. And to further expand the interoperability across different apps that store digital identities, the search giant is aiming to support open standards via various identity providers and services through the Android operating system.</p><p>Last week, through an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/04/announcing-android-support-of-digital-credentials.html?m=1">Android Developers blog post</a>, the company has announced that, “Android, via Credential Manager's DigitalCredential API, now natively supports OpenID4VP and OpenID4VCI for digital credential presentation and issuance respectively.”</p>
<p>As the search giant further explains, the Digital Credentials are cryptographically verifiable documents. They can include documents like driver's licenses, passports, or national IDs. And, through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-apps">Android apps</a> and with the help of the respective app developers, more can be incorporated and submitted digitally like education certifications, insurance policies, permits, for example in the near future.</p><p>Currently, the supported digital documents can be stored in "credential holders" apps like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet">Google Wallet</a> and Samsung Wallet. Some apps like banking or airline apps would, however, sometimes require the digital document for verification, which is not necessarily stored in the respective banking app.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3375px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="X7hXneZDSgYkAMBeaPL3ii" name="android-digital-credentials-selection-interface" alt="Android Digital Credentials selection interface" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/X7hXneZDSgYkAMBeaPL3ii.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3375" height="3375" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Since Android supports secure sharing between devices through CTAP protocols. Users will be able to store multiple credentials across apps and choose which one to pick using OpenID4VP requests from websites or Android Credential Manager API.</p><p>The process involves verifier sending an OpenID4VP request to the Digital Credential API, prompting the user to select a credential. The user here only chooses a credential, not a digital wallet app. Android then redirects the request to the digital wallet app holding the credential to complete the action. The app can further perform additional due diligence before releasing the credential.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>One of the coolest things about Nothing’s CMF line of products is their modularity. By definition, this means that you can take parts off and readily replace them as you see fit. For products like the CMF Watch Pro 2, that means you can swap the bezels, not just the bands.</p><p>The CMF Phone 1 was even more modular, allowing you to easily drop on accessories via an external screw system, which also allowed you to remove the entire back and replace it with basically anything you could find. This caused an entire 3D-printed cottage industry to pop up on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/1812538797/custom-cmf-phone-1-rear-case-3d-printed">shops like Etsy</a>, making the CMF Phone 1 the coolest phone to debut in 2024.</p><p>However, the CMF Phone 2 Pro does things a little differently, and I didn’t realize that until it was too late. As I unboxed the phone, I took the time to unscrew the back and work on prying it off. The original phone’s back design wasn’t the easiest to get off, so I wasn’t surprised it took me a bit of work to remove this one, but I wasn’t expecting the plastic to crack the way it did as I got halfway through the process.</p>

<p>After conferring with my Nothing PR contact, the company confirmed that the back of the CMF Phone 2 Pro isn’t designed to be removable the way the CMF Phone 1 was.</p><p>Looking back at the spec sheet, it’s clear this is how Nothing improved the ingress protection (IP) rating of the phone, from IP52 on the CMF Phone 1 to IP54 on the CMF Phone 2. That number four in the rating means the CMF Phone 2 Pro can now withstand splashing of water from any direction, while Phone 1 was only resistant against water drops up to a 15-degree angle.</p><p>But none of this changes the fact that I now have a CMF Phone 2 Pro with a broken back and a need to order a replacement part.</p>

<p>Instead of the pain-in-the-butt removable back of the original — if you used it you’d know how difficult it was to remove — Nothing went with a “Universal cover” design featured in our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/cmf-phone-2-pro-review">CMF Phone 2 Pro review</a> by Android Central's Harish Jonnalagadda. This cover uses all five screws to attach to the back of the phone and not only enables the use of MagSafe accessories and several other official CMF magnetic accessories, but it also gives users the ability to click additional lenses onto the cameras.</p><p>The problem, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CMFTech/comments/1kbytl1/where_are_the_accessories_for_the_cmf_phone_2_pro/">users have already found out</a>, is that this case is not only difficult to find right after launch, but U.S. beta program users don’t seem to have access to it at all. As Nothing specifically told me, these accessories are “only available on Nothing.tech in Europe + UK with limited qty.”</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="4Pc9ySngqNcMkCJ5iJ3zzV" name="CMF Phone 2 Pro" alt="CMF Phone 2 Pro review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4Pc9ySngqNcMkCJ5iJ3zzV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That basically means it’s up to Etsy and the 3D printing community to save the CMF Phone 2 Pro’s proverbial butt since Nothing itself doesn’t seem to be making a lot of accessories for the phone. I’m relatively OK with this, as I think the community proved itself the first time around and can do it again, but it’s still disappointing to see such a major design change happen and a product not receive the support it needs out of the gate to make up for it.</p><p>Lesson learned: don’t take the back off your CMF Phone 2 Pro unless you’ve already got a replacement in hand. This semi-modular phone is going to be amazing once accessory makers get off the ground and get producing products for it. For now, at least, it’s still an incredible value-priced phone that’ll exceed any expectations you might have for what a sub-$300 phone is capable of.</p>

Garmin skimped on the Elevate v5 sensor and topo maps, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-2-solar-review">Instinct 2</a> owners still get dual-band GPS, built-in LEDs, sleep coach, training load focus, and a gyroscope on top of Garmin's usual training tools.</p><p>The problem? Garmin has reached an inflection point. Any groundbreaking features or mainstream smarts go to the $1,000 Fenix 8; then, Garmin withholds these features from "cheaper" models for years to prop up the flagships. That's why the Instinct 3 feels like a bulky Forerunner with a flashlight, with no "adventurer" tools.</p><p>Thankfully, anyone upgrading from a years-old Garmin watch shouldn't feel my dissatisfaction: The Instinct 3 is an impressive fitness watch on its own merits. But the AMOLED facelift aside, only hardcore Garmin fans who're lukewarm about mainstream "smarts" will want the Instinct 3.</p>

<p>The Garmin Instinct 3 ships in 45mm and 50mm sizes, each with AMOLED and MIP Solar variants. There are "Tactical" MIP and AMOLED models and a budget Instinct E MIP; so far, there's no Instinct 3 Surf, Dezl, or Camo edition, like the Instinct 2 had.</p><p>The Garmin Instinct 3 Solar costs $399 and $449 for the 0.9-inch and 1.1-inch models, respectively; the 1.2- and 1.3-inch Instinct 3 AMOLED cost $449 and $499.</p>

<p>My <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-3-vs-2x-vs-2">Garmin Instinct 3 vs. 2X vs. 2</a> guide breaks down specific feature differences. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-2x-solar-review">Instinct 2X Solar</a>, as a compromise upgrade, got 3rd-gen perks like multi-band GPS and the flashlight in 2023. Its solar recharging crushes the Instinct 2 Solar but falls well short of the 3 Solar.</p><p>The Instinct 3 AMOLED battery life is comparable to the Instinct 2 Solar's unless you regularly spend hours in direct sunlight to recharge. There <em>is</em> a weeks-long gap between the Instinct 3 Solar and AMOLED, if you can stomach the low-res, grayscale display.</p>

<p>The Garmin Instinct 3 AMOLED has double the pixels per inch as the grayscale Solar display. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitness-watches-mip-to-amoled-transition-long-overdue">MIP displays</a> are more readable outdoors but nearly illegible indoors. The AMOLED model is more readable at home while bright enough for outdoor treks, with no pressure to <em>seek out</em> sunlight to recharge.</p><p>The old Instincts (and new 3 Solar) tracked the same data, but their two-window, low-res displays lacked space for graphs, forcing users to use Garmin's mobile app to see their progress over time. This newest model solves that problem, making data more accessible.</p>

<p>The ten default watch faces all fit several data fields — like your steps, Body Battery, recovery time, heart rate, battery life, and the weather — saving you from searching for the data.</p><p>Unfortunately, you still rely on the Up/Down buttons because the display is non-touch. They're more consistent during workouts but feel slow when navigating through menus.

<p>Display aside, the Instinct 3 sticks to the trademark bulky design you'd expect from this lineup. The raised bezel and thick, shockproof polymer protect the display and components from falls, while the 10ATM water resistance ensures the roughest water sports won't break through its shell.</p><p>The Instinct design may appeal to G-Shock fans who don't need premium materials. The new aluminum layer bisects the bezel and case so it doesn't look like one uniform heap of plastic, like past models. And I like my limited edition Neo Tropic finish: its muted greens feel at home in a forest.</p>

<p>Most people will find the Instinct 3 too <em>big</em> and buttoned to be attractive. The Instinct 2X flopped in my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-held-a-smartwatch-beauty-pageant-with-surprising-results">smartwatch beauty pageant</a>; even though the metal-edged Instinct 3 looks slightly better, it's still too bulky and athletic for most. Other Garmin watches can blend in more in professional contexts.</p><p>But if you ignore its looks, the Instinct 3 is more comfortable than you'd think. My 50mm model only weighs 59g, or 11g and 30g lighter than my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> 45mm and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> 47mm, respectively.</p>

<p>One of my biggest complaints with the last-gen Instincts was how <em>slow</em> the processor was. Noticeable lag accompanied every button press, making menu navigation a chore, and simple feature updates caused problems because of limited memory.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2025/01/garmin-instinct-3-in-depth-review-amoled-solar.html">DC Rainmaker</a> warns that the Instinct 3 Solar shares this issue since the system software takes up most of its 128MB of memory. I'm glad the Instinct 3 AMOLED has 4GB of space, with plenty of leeway.</p><p>The Instinct 3 still feels slower than other Garmin watches, even if it's faster than the Instinct 2. The missing touchscreen aside, every button press or uploaded workout has a tiny delay. But this sluggishness is the price paid to help the Instinct 3 last longer.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="KZm7TLew8S3wCEZ9EqEsDd" name="Garmin-Instinct-3-AMOLED-start-activity" alt="The Garmin Instinct 3 50mm AMOLED in the ready-to-start view for a Run activity, showing 22 hours of SatIQ battery life remaining and a "Base" workout activity of 52 minutes." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KZm7TLew8S3wCEZ9EqEsDd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For context, the Forerunner 265 and Venu 3 last 13 or 14 days, respectively, while the Instinct 3 45mm and 50mm last 18 or 24 days. These other models aren't slouches, but an extra week makes a difference.</p><p>More importantly, the Instinct 3 lasts up to 30 hours in SatIQ mode with multi-band GPS, beating the Forerunner 265 by 14 hours, though losing to the Fenix 8 51mm by 32 hours.</p><p>Garmin's watches typically fall a few days or GPS hours short of the official battery estimates. On paper, you should only burn about 3% of your Instinct 3 battery per hour of activity; I observed at least 5%. But that's still significantly better than almost any other fitness watch I've tested!</p>

<p>The only true battery killer is the built-in flashlight. It has four white-LED intensity levels and a dimmer red LED; you can set any intensity to various strobe patterns to flash your presence, signaling your presence to cars and cyclists at night.</p><p>I've never cared to use Garmin's torch much. It's nice to whip out with a quick double-button tap to stumble to the bathroom, illuminate your pathway, or navigate a tent zipper without blinding others nearby. However, its max brightness can't match a typical phone flashlight, while still burning through your battery quickly.</p><p>I'd rather have it and not need it than the opposite. If your phone dies in an emergency, this flashlight is much better than the display flashlight mode on most watches. But if you regularly run at night, you'll still need a knuckle light or headlamp.</p>

<p>Garmin gave the Instinct 3 the same Elevate v4 sensor as the last few years of Garmin watches. While its multi-band GPS is industry-leading for accuracy, it hasn't changed much in recent years, aside from the SatIQ mode, which saves battery by only using multiple satellites when there's signal blockage.</p><p>All that is to say, if you've read any of my dozen Garmin reviews since 2022, there's nothing new to say here. I'll run through my results briefly, but the Instinct 3 is about as accurate as any other recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a>.</p>

<p>The Instinct 3's optical HR sensor did fairly well keeping up with an optical arm band, with only a little lag, and ended with the same average heart rate.

<p>During the run, the dual-band Vantage M3 measured 0.01 miles or 16m more distance than the Instinct 3, which was using SatIQ mode. Polar's tracking was slightly more accurate at most points, while Garmin tended to drift off the trail a bit under light foliage while staying dead-on when unobstructed.</p><p>This is my typical experience with SatIQ mode, which doesn't always kick in with better accuracy quickly enough. But it also shows how Garmin's standard GPS tracking keeps pace with other brands' multi-band results, which is reassuring.</p>

During intervals, the Instinct 3 can show your rest timer, allow for open repeats, or auto-detect starts — things the Instinct 2's tiny brain couldn't handle.</p>

<p>There are a few software perks on the Fenix 8 like hill & endurance scores, Strava Live Segments, diving tools, and (again) topo maps that you might wish the Instinct 3 had. But overall, the core Garmin experience is the same as ever. It's very easy to use this watch to get fitter or faster, and the AMOLED display exhibits your data in accessible charts.</p><p>As a final side note, the Instinct 3 doesn't come with a complimentary <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-connect-plus-in-depth-hands-on-much-more-than-an-ai-unfortunately">Connect Plus subscription</a> period, which is a shame. No <em>major</em> Instinct 3 features are locked behind this paywall, but you may still end up paying for it.</p>

<p><strong>You shouldn't buy the Garmin Instinct 3 if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a watch that'll blend in.</li><li>You want a touchscreen, voice commands, music storage, or apps.</li><li>You'd be fine with a cheaper Garmin that "only" lasts two weeks.</li></ul>
<p>I loved the Garmin Instinct 2 and 2X for their longevity, but I barely used them outside of workouts. By adding an AMOLED display, the Instinct 3 is slightly more usable, even if the buttons and slow CPU hold it back.</p><p>The Instinct 3 AMOLED feels like a longer-lived, rugged Forerunner 265, but since that came out in 2023 — and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-975-and-275-will-show-if-garmin-is-running-out-of-ideas">Forerunner 275 and 975</a> should (allegedly) arrive soon — I'm not sure if Garmin gave its new Instinct enough of a distinct identity, now that it's not an "unlimited" battery watch.</p><p>Garmin Instinct fans clearly don't care about the bells and whistles, however, so they won't care that the Instinct 3 doesn't have them! Ignore my nitpicks and enjoy the fact that it's objectively better than the Instinct 2 and 2X.</p>

It's easy to look at book-style foldables, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">Oppo Find N5</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>, as the premium option, with clamshell foldables serving as the more affordable entry into the market. When I first got into the foldable space, that's exactly what I thought.</p><p>My first purchase was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3</a>, and I quickly upgraded to the Galaxy Z Fold 4 as soon as I could afford it. Bigger must be better, and the more expensive one must be the best one, right? A few years later, after spending extended time with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold and Galaxy Z Fold 6 in my pocket, I can't believe how wrong I was.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kCFoS9NbMAUwvfELWfypJ9" name="Google-Pixel-9-Pro-Fold-Main-Screen" alt="The Pixel 9 Pro Fold's main screen open in hand." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kCFoS9NbMAUwvfELWfypJ9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>No matter how much I <em>want</em> to love having a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">giant foldable</a> in my pocket, I just don't end up using it. The cover screen gets used about 90% of the time, and the 10% that I use the large main screen ends up feeling like a chore. Neither option is as ergonomically sound as, say, using a clamshell foldable or a normal flagship.</p><p>All these experiences added up over years testing foldables. Eventually, they came to a head when I took my main SIM out of the Pixel 9 Pro Fold (my then-daily driver) to test the Nothing Phone 3a Pro and the Pixel 9a. After a few weeks without the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, I simply realized I didn't want to go back. Here's why.</p>
<h2 id="everything-book-style-foldables-get-wrong-and-right-2">Everything book-style foldables get wrong (and right)</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TbXMRzhz2TDzGYuePc9DtL" name="Phone-Form-Factor-Comparison-3" alt="Foldable phones compared across form factors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TbXMRzhz2TDzGYuePc9DtL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Pixel 9 Pro Fold doesn't offer as much extra space for video as you might expect. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's objectively true that book-style foldables offer more screen real estate than typical flagships and clamshells. However, whether that extra space will be useful to you will depend on what exactly you plan to do with it. I hoped to use my assortment of large foldables — including two generations each of Galaxy Z Fold and Pixel Fold models — for superior media consumption. In theory, everything from movies to YouTube videos should pop.</p><p>This led to my biggest let-down of using foldables. Due to the widescreen nature of most long-form video, using a Pixel 9 Pro Fold or Galaxy Z Fold 6 didn't make my content that much larger, as you can see in the photo above. The average video on a Pixel 9 Pro Fold is just marginally bigger than what you'd get from a standard <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>. Of course, you can crop in, but you'll lose a massive chunk of content — it becomes borderline unenjoyable.</p><p>So, the big-screen foldables weren't the content-consumption powerhouses I had hoped. What about other use cases that <em>should </em>benefit from a larger screen, like productivity and gaming? They were similarly underwhelming.</p><p>Both the Pixel 9 Pro Fold and the Galaxy Z Fold 6 suffered from odd aspect ratios and poor user interfaces, and typing is specifically difficult on the Pixel's wide form factor. Productivity apps aren't truly tapping into the big screens on large foldables, and Chrome <em>still</em> refuses to load many websites in true desktop mode. You could make the case that it should do this by default when the main screen is opened, like how it works on an iPad mini.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="F4nXdS8W3Q2CdCuPuq8dLn" name="Two-Apps-Pixel-Fold" alt="Multitasking on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/F4nXdS8W3Q2CdCuPuq8dLn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I will say that the excellent productivity feature on both the Pixel 9 Pro Fold and the Galaxy Z Fold 6 is opening two apps in split-screen mode. You can do this on many Android phones, but doing so on a large foldable with the main screen open effectively gives you two separate windows the size of the cover screen. It's amazing for times when you need to view multiple screens or apps at the same time to work.</p><p>That said, gaming was largely disappointing for me for a few reasons. On a Pixel 9 Pro Fold, it's clear that the Tensor G4 chip inside is holding the device back. Games like Fortnite, which can run on something as lowly as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/this-is-how-nintendo-aims-to-stop-switch-2-emulation">Nintendo Switch</a>, struggle to hit decent frame rates with subpar graphics. Meanwhile, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 is a much better performer, but still requires a separate controller to be great.</p><p>Not for lack of trying, I can't find a "killer" feature" of big foldables that makes me want to carry one daily.</p>

<p>It's clear that book-style foldables, like the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Pixel 9 Pro Fold, are what we call a "jack of all trades." They can be a normal phone when you need them to be, and a tablet when you want a bigger screen. They make calls, handle spreadsheets, take photos, and can even play some games.</p><p>However, they're not excellent at <em>any</em> of those things. After using both for months at a time, I'm convinced the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Pixel 9 Pro Fold — and big foldables in general — are jacks of all trades, but masters of none.</p><p>I've tried to make large foldables fit into my life and workflow for three full years, starting on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4</a>'s release date. Now, I'm certain that I would rather have the right device for the task at hand than one that tries to do it all in a way that's just fine.</p><p>You can buy a new Google Pixel 9, a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Pixel Tablet</a>, and a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/these-smart-glasses-really-saved-my-neck">Steam Deck</a> for the same price or less than a Galaxy Z Fold 6 or Pixel 9 Pro Fold at retail, and I'd absolutely choose those three excellent products over a foldable. While I might give <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-series-hands-on">clamshell foldables</a> another shot in the near future, I think it's safe to say that I'm done using a book-style foldable as my daily driver.</p>

Fast-forward about a year later, and Project Astra is in the hands of millions of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Google Pixel 9</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Samsung Galaxy S25</a>, and Gemini Advanced users. It's ready, and it's here — but is it actually useful?</p><p>The answer is that it absolutely can be, as long as its use cases are personal to you. For instance, Gemini Live's multimodal features aren't going to be a better alternative to Google Search or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> in most cases. However, in specific circumstances where it's better to show than tell, Gemini Live's camera support can come in handy.</p><p>After weeks of testing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini Live</a> with video streaming, the feature has become an irreplaceable part of one of my non-tech hobbies: gardening. I've done it all my life, but after moving from the Garden State to the Arizona desert, I had to relearn <em>everything </em>— new growing seasons, care techniques, problems, and everything in between.</p><p>To my surprise, it wasn't Google or Reddit that helped me navigate this climate most. It was Gemini Live.</p>

<p>AI can be fun to play around with, but it's only truly useful if you know when to use it. Specifically, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-lives-video-streaming-screen-sharing-support-comes-to-pixel-9-series">Gemini Live's camera features</a> offer the most utility when you have something right in front of you that you're not sure how to describe. Maybe it's a piece of furniture in a coffee shop you don't know the name of, or a monument with a faded plaque. In these situations, typing a written prompt into a chatbot or a search engine won't do you any good.</p><p>That's where you'd want to turn on your camera in Gemini Live. It'll help out in many situations, including identifying plants. I picked up a few small potted plants from Ikea and turned to Gemini Live to figure out exactly what they were and how to care for them. Here's how Gemini responded, based on pointing my camera at the plant:</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>That looks like an aloe vera plant! Is there anything you'd like to know about aloe vera care?</p><figcaption><cite>Gemini Live</cite></figcaption></blockquote></figure>
<p>While this is all happening off-device, Gemini returned the answer pretty fast. Sure enough, it looks like an aloe vera plant. After that, I took the AI assistant up on its offer to enlighten me on care options. Here's what it said:</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Sure, aloe vera plants are easy to care for. They need bright, sunny spots and well-drained soil. You should let the soil dry out between watering. During the spring and summer, you'll want to water it about every two weeks. In the fall and winter, you can cut back to about once a month.</p><figcaption><cite>Gemini Live</cite></figcaption></blockquote></figure>
<p>The responses were clear and concise, and they ended up saving me a ton of time researching care instructions for a plant I wasn't even sure the name of a few minutes earlier.</p>
<h2 id="it-ll-come-up-with-care-options-for-your-plants-too-2">It'll come up with care options for your plants, too</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CfxY5HjEPrXfrXTvWK6u2W" name="Gemini-Live-Plants-4" alt="Using Gemini Live to grow plants and diagnose problems." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CfxY5HjEPrXfrXTvWK6u2W.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-rolls-out-new-gemini-live-experience-with-saved-audio-recordings">Gemini Live</a> were only able to identify plants by looking at them, it would be cool, but it wouldn't be groundbreaking. The killer feature here is the care instructions that Gemini can provide just by looking at a plant. To test this, I showed it a live camera feed of my basil plant and asked how I should take care of it, and Gemini replied with the following:</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>That's a nice basil plant! It needs about six hours of sunlight each day, so a sunny spot is perfect. You should water it when the top inch of soil feels dry, and make sure the pot has good drainage. Do you have a sunny spot in mind for it?</p><figcaption><cite>Gemini Live</cite></figcaption></blockquote></figure>
<p>I then told Gemini I was planning to keep the basil out on my balcony, and it seemed to like the idea.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>A balcony is a great spot! Basil thrives with six to eight hours of direct sunlight each day. Just make sure to bring it inside if the temperature drops below 50 degrees or rises above 90 degrees Fahrenheit.</p><figcaption><cite>Gemini Live</cite></figcaption></blockquote></figure>
<p>The cool thing about going "live" with Gemini is that you can easily provide context or follow-up questions in real time. For example, when the AI suggested I bring it inside when the temperature drops, I could let Gemini know that it won't be an issue in my climate. It's easy to get context-specific advice when using your camera with Gemini Live.</p>
<h2 id="when-issues-arise-gemini-live-can-diagnose-them-2">When issues arise, Gemini Live can diagnose them</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="P2AwZxehgPi2Smy7Ldjx8X" name="Gemini-Live-Plants-2" alt="Using Gemini Live to grow plants and diagnose problems." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P2AwZxehgPi2Smy7Ldjx8X.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>By far, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/gemini-live-real-time-screen-sharing-now-available-to-all-android-users">Gemini Live's</a> most useful capability is diagnosing problems you might run into with your plants. As I mentioned earlier, I'm new to growing plants in the desert, and it's a learning curve. Since the sun is so intense and the temperature can exceed 120 degrees Fahrenheit, the climate is unforgiving. I was bound to run into issues, and Gemini Live helped me navigate them.</p><p>In one case, my hydroponic jalapeño and tomato plants were having a hard time. The jalapeño leaves were browning, and the tomatoes just weren't turning red. It was Gemini that suggested my apartment's temperature could be the problem, and sure enough, after turning up the heat for a few days, the tomatoes ripened. It also identified health problems with my plants, as explained in the reply below:</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Your jalapeño plant looks like it might have a few issues. The leaves are curling and have some brown spots, which could be from overwatering or a nutrient deficiency. The tomatoes also look like they might have blossom end rot, which is caused by a calcium deficiency. Do you have any plant fertilizer on hand?</p><figcaption><cite>Gemini Live</cite></figcaption></blockquote></figure>
<p>It's important to remember that while you're reading the transcript of my conversation with Gemini, this is all being spoken to me in real-time — the same way you'd have a conversation with another person.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2u42Umpxe3p5YtqGi2Y93V" name="Gemini-Live-Plants-3" alt="Using Gemini Live to grow plants and diagnose problems." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2u42Umpxe3p5YtqGi2Y93V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I realized <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/how-use-gemini-live-camera-screen-sharing">Gemini Live's multimodal features</a> were the real deal when it noticed that I was using an AeroGarden hydroponic system just from the information it could see via my camera feed. After picking up on that information, I received tailored care instructions as follows:</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Okay, great. You can try adding a balanced liquid fertilizer to the water in your AeroGarden, following the instructions on the label. That should help with any nutrient issues. For the blossom end rot on the tomatoes, you can try adding a calcium supplement to the water.</p><figcaption><cite>Gemini Live</cite></figcaption></blockquote></figure>
<p>While I might usually dive into gardening books, research studies, or Reddit threads for hours to solve these types of problems, everything you see in this article happened within just a few minutes.</p><p>Often, plant growing problems can show the same symptoms, making them hard to diagnose, especially when you're just getting started. Gemini was vital in helping me overcome them.</p>
<h2 id="my-plants-are-stronger-than-ever-thanks-to-gemini-live-2">My plants are stronger than ever thanks to Gemini Live</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YknC8dSpXbvXBMUsJ89xi4" name="Gemini-Logo-Plants" alt="The Gemini logo overlaid on tomato plants." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YknC8dSpXbvXBMUsJ89xi4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future / Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you've gotten this far and aren't as excited by Gemini's gardening prowess as I am, fear not. This is just one way Gemini Live can help you out in your daily life, and there are many more. I used Gemini to solve problems with my plants, but in the tech world, we simply call that troubleshooting.</p><p>You could follow the exact same steps for just about anything else you need to figure out. In Google's first-ever demo of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-project-starline-astra-ar-glasses">Project Astra at Google I/O 2024</a>, it used the technology to troubleshoot a finicky record player. These are exactly the kinds of things AI can be great at — it is trained on material that includes user manuals, textbooks, and even online forums. You can tap into the online history of the internet without doing any of the work.</p><p>So, before you write off Gemini Live, give its new multimodal camera support a try. When you find <em>your</em> use case for it, it'll become invaluable.</p>

<p>This year, it will be five years since LG launched what’s considered its last flagship smartphone. The LG Wing was a very unique device featuring a swivel design that you won’t really find anywhere else, and probably for good reason. The novel design was one that turned heads, but surprisingly (or maybe not), the LG Wing ultimately failed to garner enough attention to keep LG in the game. The following year, LG announced it was leaving the smartphone business.</p><p>I’ve been holding onto the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/lg-wing-review">LG Wing</a> for the past five years, and it was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.lg.com/tw/support/announcement/TWNTC2025041101/?cjdata=MXxOfDB8WXww&cjevent=2dd6379727a011f080ac009b0a1cb828&utm_source=cj-affiliate-2470763&utm_medium=affiliate">recently announced</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/lg-smartphone-updates-3548804/">Android Authority</a>) that LG will soon shut down its update service, meaning that anyone still using an LG phone will soon no longer be able to update it.</p><p>Fortunately, I’ve managed to keep my Wing updated (as much as possible) over the years. It's mostly been collecting dust in a drawer all the time, so as a self-proclaimed former LG fanboy, I recently decided to revisit this unique device and take it for a spin now that it's been some time since LG bowed out.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Rfs9TCRaKLSTn569Fewe5a" name="LG-Wing-revisit-2025-01" alt="The LG Wing main swivel screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Rfs9TCRaKLSTn569Fewe5a.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The LG Wing came at a time when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> were still getting off the ground. They weren't as popular as they are today, and companies were still working out the hardware and software intricacies that came with building foldables. That's where the Wing came in, offering an alternative for anyone who worried about the longevity of a folding display.</p><p>At the time, I thought LG was smart to forgo the potential costs associated with developing a foldable phone. Instead, the company leaned on the latest (and eventually final) evolution of the Second Screen concept it had been pushing on consumers for years.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3953px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="YR5ZHN2Y8LPgCycMXLsnqY" name="LG-Wing-revisit-2025-16" alt="The LG Wing next to a bush" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YR5ZHN2Y8LPgCycMXLsnqY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3953" height="2224" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The idea was fairly simple in concept: you can use the phone as you regularly would on its primary display, but then you could reveal a secondary screen whenever you needed it. It stayed out of sight until it was needed, which I really appreciated.</p><p>LG also had some ideas of how this second screen could be used. Apps could utilize both displays in unique ways, which actually made a fair amount of sense. For instance, when the main display was swiveled up, I could watch a YouTube video in full view on the horizontal screen while the various video controls remained on the second screen underneath. This made it easy to adjust volume, brightness, skip forward, and more.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3906px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="gMmJXW9YYJYzFLMyeBbri6" name="LG-Wing-revisit-2025-19" alt="YouTube on the LG Wing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gMmJXW9YYJYzFLMyeBbri6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3906" height="2197" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The other use for the second screen was multitasking. My favorite use case was always using Google Maps on the primary display to navigate, while the second screen would be used to control music.</p><p>Of course, there's much more you can do with it, so long as you're okay with some apps being squished down to the almost-square aspect ratio. But to me, this made me think of multitasking in ways I never considered before. Since I'm not a fan of using split screen on standard candybar phones, this gave me another option that I much preferred.</p><p>LG also had a fun mouse function that let you use the second screen to control the main display.</p>

<p>Then there's the camera. LG did something pretty unique by adding a secondary ultrawide "Gimbal Motion Camera" that's rotated 90-degrees and would work when the phone is in Swivel Mode. Basically, this allowed the users to move the viewfinder around without needing to physically move the sensor and helped stabilize videos in a similar way to an actual gimbal camera system.</p><p>It's a unique way to take advantage of the phone's unique form factor, as you can simply hold the phone by the second screen for more stable handling of the phone when recording. It also potentially saves you from having to purchase a separate smartphone gimbal.</p>

<p>I will say that I was thoroughly surprised at the photo quality from the main wide and ultrawide sensors. I was always a fan of LG's video capabilities, but photo quality always left a lot to be desired on previous LG phones I've used, so it was good to see LG improve on this front with the Wing.</p><p>In the LG Wing review, it was noted how the primary camera "goes toe-to-toe with some of the best Android cameras out there, with impressive dynamic range and color clarity, plus minimal noise even in darker conditions." I wouldn't say that LG could compete with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-camera">best Android cameras of 2025</a>, but it certainly wasn't bad for 2020.</p><p>Unfortunately, camera improvements and a novel smartphone form factor were not enough to save the Wing or LG.</p>
<h2 id="too-many-compromises-2">Too many compromises</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Xo7JFZscFVmwAFEWZ3XKYZ" name="LG-Wing-revisit-2025-10" alt="The LG Wing lying face down on a table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Xo7JFZscFVmwAFEWZ3XKYZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ultimately, the LG Wing was a flop. I can't say whether it was a result of the COVID-19 pandemic that saw consumers making fewer non-essential spending choices or just the overall reception of the LG Wing and its admittedly cool but strange design. Either way, the phone did not resonate with consumers.</p><p>For one, the phone was expensive at launch for what you got. It cost $999 but featured a squarely mid-range Snapdragon chipset usually reserved for cheaper smartphones. By comparison, the more conventional <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/lg-v60-thinq-5g-review">LG V60</a> cost less, featured a more powerful flagship Snapdragon chipset, and had a larger battery, making it feel like a better deal.</p><p>But more than that, it felt like LG was trying to do the absolute most with the absolute least, and the payoff just wasn't there.</p>
<div class="inlinegallery  inline-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="m6VMc5GUBRMfR5p3oYeU7a" name="LG-Wing-revisit-2025-07" alt="The LG Wing with Google Search on the Swivel screen and the LG keyboard on the Second screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/m6VMc5GUBRMfR5p3oYeU7a.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3948px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="nmDUw3MNF5TJbGrSw6mWxZ" name="LG-Wing-revisit-2025-08" alt="The LG Wing with Gboard on the Swivel screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nmDUw3MNF5TJbGrSw6mWxZ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3948" height="2221" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div>
<p>LG wasn't known for having the best software, and while I never particularly minded it, many considered the UI to be behind Samsung's One UI and others. That said, it feels like LG is stretching itself thin trying to get the Wing to work properly.</p><p>Switching from regular to Swivel mode and back feels janky, adding apps to the Second Screen is more cumbersome than it needs to be, and Gboard can't be used properly in Swivel mode; only LG keyboard will work on the Second Screen, which kinda misses the point if I have to use Gboard on the primary display while in swivel mode.</p><p>Samsung has a similar limitation on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/24-hours-using-only-the-motorola-razr-and-galaxy-z-flip-cover-screens">Galaxy Z Flip 6 cover screen</a>, where I can <em>only</em> use Samsung Keyboard, and it's a key annoyance for me.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Software and support were some of the biggest issues with the Wing.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>That highlights a key problem with Swivel Mode on the LG Wing: as cool as it was, it also felt woefully underutilized. LG just didn't garner the kind of app support that was needed to fully take advantage of it. At launch, it leaned heavily on YouTube, the Whale browser, and an optimized version of Asphalt 9 to show off how apps could utilize the second screen, but the selection remained lacking throughout its lifecycle.</p><p>This left multitasking as the main function for the second screen, which wasn't enough of a draw for this phone.</p><p>LG was also known for not having the best update cadence or policy, which also didn't help the Wing's case. Funnily enough, I feel like it improved after LG <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/its-official-lg-exiting-smartphone-business">announced</a> its departure from the smartphone market, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/lg-wing-android-13-update">the Wing has since received three OS upgrades</a> up to Android 13.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3185px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="sPZX3Kp7QYKroQSsshKHCY" name="LG-Wing-revisit-2025-12" alt="The LG Wing with two apps next to each other" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sPZX3Kp7QYKroQSsshKHCY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3185" height="1792" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Then there's the gimbal camera, which was cool in theory, but was always the phone's weakest point for me. I wanted to really like it, but the video quality was never particularly good, to the point where I would just stick to the main wide and ultrawide sensors. It didn't help that video was capped at FHD in Gimbal Mode, and the result was a surprisingly noisy and just not good.</p><p>The Wing had an opportunity to take my video, my favorite thing about LG phones, and really do something cool, but in the end, it just fell flat.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3730px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9C38DDDccCVnryG7Uv8LqY" name="LG-Wing-revisit-2025-09" alt="The LG Wing selfie camera" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9C38DDDccCVnryG7Uv8LqY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3730" height="2098" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Holding the phone years later, I also can't help but notice how the Wing also just feels surprisingly un-LG in a weird way. The unique form factor was a very LG thing to do, but the compromises felt a bit uncharacteristic, such as the lack of stereo speakers and a 3.5mm headphone jack. Even the design choices, with a curved display, fingerprint magnet on the back panel, and noisy pop-up selfie camera, make the phone feel like it was built by a different company.</p><p>The phone is also heavy (at 260g, it's heavier than even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>), only features an IP54 water and dust resistance rating, and the fingerprint sensor is very slow.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3984px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PgcyUaFBk3UaRXcMyFJijY" name="LG-Wing-revisit-2025-06" alt="The LG Wing with fingerprints all over its back glass panel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PgcyUaFBk3UaRXcMyFJijY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3984" height="2241" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>LG was great at standing out with its experimental phones, and the Wing was clearly never meant to be a huge hit, but LG made some odd choices that I feel ensured it wouldn't do well.</p><p>That said, I can't help but feel like some of what we got with the LG Wing helped prepare me for foldables, particularly flip phones.</p>
<h2 id="prepping-me-for-foldables-2">Prepping me for foldables</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4194px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Sjjgt7tJPUoNDibaCGH4LZ" name="LG-Wing-revisit-2025-13" alt="The LG Wing next to the Razr Plus 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Sjjgt7tJPUoNDibaCGH4LZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4194" height="2359" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Foldables weren't my thing back in 2020, but with the resurgence of the Motorola Razr, I've gone all-in on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phones</a>. It's a familiar design that spans generations, and now with modern smartphone technology, it can live on in a much-smarter and user-friendly way. Where LG tried to differentiate itself with the Wing, modern flip phones relied heavily on the past to gain popularity.</p><p>Still, I think the Wing was onto something with its smaller second screen. This wasn't meant to be a primary way of interacting with the phone, but an optional way for users to get a little extra out of their devices.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4036px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="atKEe6BRiJzUQ8oDGuPknZ" name="LG-Wing-revisit-2025-03" alt="The LG Wing Second Screen next to the Razr Plus 2025 cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/atKEe6BRiJzUQ8oDGuPknZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4036" height="2270" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Modern flagship flip phones take a similar approach, yet they make the smaller cover screen a first option as a way to quickly get through notifications, messages, and more. Then, if and when necessary, you can open the device to reveal a regular-sized smartphone.</p><p>With this in mind, I can't help but think LG would have done better to opt for a flip phone form factor than to try and reinvent the wheel with a Swivel phone. It may have taken a generation or two to really take off, but given the growing popularity of the Razr and Galaxy Z Flip lineups, maybe we would still have LG around to keep us on our toes with other unique devices like the unreleased <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/lg-rollable-hands-on-video">Rollable phone</a>.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/google-io-2025" target="_blank">Google I/O is right around the corner</a>, and if you're a tech fanatic, you're already waiting for all the cool things that it's going to bring, or at least talk about. Even if we never see them (remember <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/project-soli-amazing-innovation-thats-looking-home">Project Soli</a>?), the ideas that come from Google's genius worker bees can be cool as heck.</p><p>But hearing them can also be a pain in the you-know-what. It's always been that way, and the reason has never changed — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/everyone-is-talking-about-google-i-o-but-what-exactly-is-it-and-who-is-it-for">Google I/O is not for you and me</a>.</p>

<p>Maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. If you're a software developer interested in Google's consumer products, or if you are interested in becoming one, then it is for you. If you're a regular Jane or Joe, like most of us, then it's a couple of days of talk about tokens and APIs with a tiny bit of interesting stuff sprinkled through.</p><p>It's my job to pay attention, and I still love to dabble with development, but even I get overwhelmed. Not that I'm some sort of tech Superman, but I am closer to the actual <em>intended</em> audience than most.</p>
<p>Don't worry though, because after all these years I have figured out exactly how to digest what's cool and different coming from Google's annual developer conference: don't pay a lot of attention to it.</p>

<p>Really, I'm serious. If you're a bit of a nerd, then the keynote and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16" target="_blank"><em>What's New in Android</em></a> presentations can be fun to watch, but be prepared to hear about stuff like those tokens, limits, AI engines, and analytical training for most of the hour.</p><p>Let people like me, who are forced to watch and pay attention, do it. Then we tell you about it, without all the tech-nerd gobbly-goo. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-teases-a-special-i-o-edition-of-the-android-show">Anything cool</a> will be all over your favorite tech websites; we'll be covering it extensively because it's what we at Android Central do best.

So will other Android websites, or general tech sites like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/tech" target="_blank">The Verge</a>.</p><p>Read all of those. If it sounds cool, read it twice, even. Then, be prepared to never see any of it materialize so that when some of it does happen, it's a pleasant surprise. Cynical, but healthy.</p>

<p>Like I said earlier, Google I/O isn't for you. Really, even the stuff about what's coming in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> isn't for you. On its surface, it is meant to get developers ready, but at its core, it's all done for the shareholders.</p><p>Like it or not, all businesses work this way, and Google isn't an exception. Every single decision has to start with "How does this affect share value?" or eventually there will be no decisions to make because there will be no Google to make them.</p><p>What Google has planned for its own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-vs-pixel-9-pro">Pixel phones</a> is often cool as heck, and sometimes we even get to see some of it rub off on the software from other companies. If you <em>really</em> want to know about Android 16 for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a>, for example, you should watch Samsung's developer conference.</p><p>Either way, hearing about it can be fun. Learning about it without sitting through the slog and trying to pay attention is even better.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Smartwatch charging is a mess, with a different proprietary cable for every brand. Lose your watch cable on a trip, and you're waiting a week for an expensive replacement or hoping a knock-off Amazon cable works. However, the fitness watch brand COROS has found a unique solution to the dilemma of charging cable for watches.</p><p>When COROS launched its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-pace-pro-review">PACE Pro watch</a>, it replaced its usual three-pin cable with a tiny USB-C dongle; you insert a USB-C cable into it, then plug the dongle's pins into your watch. This way, you don't need to keep a phone <em>and</em> watch charging cable on hand — just slide the dongle onto your phone cable every couple of weeks when the battery dies.</p><p>That "A2" dongle was PACE Pro-exclusive, but this new "USB-C to COROS A1 Charging Adapter" works with the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-pace-3-review">PACE 3</a> and 2, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-apex-2-review">APEX 2</a> and 2 Pro, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-vertix-2s-vs-garmin-forerunner-965-vs-polar-vantage-v3-fitness-test">VERTIX 2S</a> and 2. I also assume future COROS watches will match the A1 adapter, making it the universal option.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="EquUBYynGwXpfU2PpfeU88" name="Coros-usb-c-adapter-plugged-into-pace-3-watch" alt="The USB-C to COROS A1 Charging Adapter with a USB-C cable plugged into it, plugged into a COROS PACE 3 smartwatch." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EquUBYynGwXpfU2PpfeU88.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is still a "proprietary" charging solution, so you're screwed if you lose this tiny adapter; from experience, it's very easy for people to assume it's trash and toss it. Thankfully, COROS bundled it with a key ring holder so you can latch it onto a backpack and never lose track of it.</p><p>I'd love to see other fitness watch brands emulate COROS's approach. Garmin, Polar, Amazfit, Suunto, Fitbit, and other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watch</a> brands each have unique connectors, so they'd each need their own adapters. But I'd still prefer a tiny, distinct adapter so that I can keep another (more useful) USB-C cable plugged into my charging brick at all times.</p><p>I suspect that we'll eventually see more watches adopt the Qi2 wireless charging instead, which would arguably be an even better "universal" charging option. But COROS piggybacking on the USB-C standard is the next best thing.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6vK9MH3VxuccFPa6VrwzRa" name="Tangled-chargers.jpeg" alt="Charging cables for the Apple Watch, Amazfit Band 7, Galaxy Watch 5 Pro, Fitbit Sense, Amazfit GTS 2, COROS APEX 2, and Garmin Forerunner 955." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6vK9MH3VxuccFPa6VrwzRa.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A couple of years back, I asked Jitesh Ubrani, IDC's research manager of worldwide device trackers, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wearable-charging-is-an-unsolvable-mess">why smartwatch charging is such an unsolvable mess</a> and whether the EU should step in for a universal standard, just as they forced Apple to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-usb-c-confirmed">drop Lightning for USB-C</a>.</p><p>He explained that "wearables come in far too many shapes and sizes" for a universal standard to make sense.</p><p>If every watch had to use a Qi charging coil, for example, it would "stifle innovation" and "do more harm than good," particularly to smaller brands that design their watches to prioritize other perks like larger batteries.</p><p>Ubrani said that wireless charging would become "more ubiquitous in the coming years as costs come down and power consumption amongst smartwatches is reduced." But fitness watch brands stick with the status quo because slower charging isn't a big deal when your watch lasts 1–3 weeks.</p><p>So, until that distant future when wireless charging makes sense to fitness brands, COROS's adapter is the next best thing.</p>

<p>At the moment, Apple and Galaxy Watches use magnetized wireless charging cables, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/pixel-watch-4-renders-leak-indicate-thicker-build-and-removal-of-charging-pins">leaked Pixel Watch 4 renders</a> suggest that Google will ditch its current pin-charging system for wireless charging. However, they don't follow a particular standard, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-wireless-charging-standard">Qi2 wireless charging</a>, so they're not interchangeable.</p><p>Switching between Android and iOS isn't particularly common, but it would be nice if all the mainline <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android watches</a> and Apple Watches used interchangeable Qi2 chargers.</p><p>Qi2 supports fast wireless charging and a strong magnetized fit, making it less likely that your watch fails to charge because you didn't seat it properly. Plus, if you switch brands, your old charging cable doesn't suddenly become useless e-waste. Instead, it could charge other Qi-compliant devices.</p><p>Because these watches all use similar processors and hardware, I doubt it would be particularly onerous for any one brand to use an industry-standard charging coil. And because they only last a couple of days per charge, prioritizing faster charging is more important for these watches, anyway.</p><p>As long as using Qi2 wouldn't prevent watches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-review">OnePlus Watch 3</a> from hitting <em>faster</em> charging speeds, I don't see any downside to a more consistent universal watch standard. But since most brands would prefer the flexibility of their own unique charging solutions, I doubt will see this happen anytime soon.</p>

<p>This is Android Central's News Weekly, your go-to source for a concise roundup of the week's most significant tech stories. This is where we delve into the top headlines that provide the latest developments and innovations contributing to the digital landscape.</p><p>This week saw some major leaks, Android 16's alleged redesign, Galaxy S25's launch date and full specs leak, U.K. residents get access to Google's digital IDs,  Samsung teases its new foldable, and Meta's Q1 earnings show major AI priority shift. Let's dive in.</p>
<h2 id="android-16-s-ui-redesign-pops-up-in-a-leak-2">Android 16's UI redesign pops up in a leak</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:835px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.81%;"><img id="Bo4FVrk5YDhLtnTepV9Jya" name="android-16-lockscreen-redesign-leaked-look" alt="Android 16's code teases a lock screen redesign, that alters the clock font slightly and places the date/temp under it when there are no notifications." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Bo4FVrk5YDhLtnTepV9Jya.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="835" height="466" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>See all the UI changes </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-ui-icons-panel-redesign-leak"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>This week gave us a first look at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/android-16">Android 16</a>'s redesign and it comes from Mishaal Rahman. He seems to have stumbled on these UI changes while digging through Android 16's Beta 4. Rahman notices some changes to the shapes of app icons, stating that the OS could bring more "geometric" shape options, as well as the standard circle.</p><p>Rahman found choices like a square, a "four-sided cookie," and a "seven-sided cookie." Next up is the notification panel which could get a blurred/transparent user interface. The tiles within the panel also seem to have gotten a more rounded- bubble like appearance.</p><p>The lock screen also might get a fresh coat of paint. Rahman's snapshots show Google may alter the font of the clock while moving the date and temperature beneath it. If there are notifications, the clock will still move to the top left; however, the date/temp information will be featured on its right side, not under it.</p><p>Additionally, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-to-bring-a-dynamic-battery-indicator">battery icon may see a pop of color</a> as Google could ditch the old colorless icon for a horizontal battery with its percentage and a color-coded background.</p>

Meta said these losses were "due to lower <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/meta-quest">Meta Quest</a> sales" but "partially offset" by tripled Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses sales.</p><p>Meta's "five major opportunities" for further growth include using AI to build better ad campaigns, recommending more relevant social media and video content via AI, and creating "AI business agents that can do customer support and sales" in apps like WhatsApp and Messenger.</p><p>Lastly, speaking about its challenges, Meta said it's concerned about the EU ruling stating that its "subscription for no ads model is not compliant with the Digital Markets Act (DMA)." Meta says it's "in the process of engaging with the European Commission," and it senses a significant lull in profits could be in the cards.</p>

<p>NotebookLM's chatbot and research functions are now powered by Gemini 2.5 Flash, a thinking model with advanced reasoning techniques, Google announced today, May 2 in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/NotebookLM/status/1918412708426244589" target="_blank">post</a> on X (formerly Twitter).

SO busy that we forgot to mention that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/NotebookLM">@NotebookLM </a>is officially powered by Gemini 2.5 Flash," the official NotebookLM account posted on X (formerly Twitter).  "The 2.5 models are thinking models, so you should start to see more comprehensive answers, particularly to complex, multi-step reasoning questions."</p><p>The move comes after Google announced that NotebookLM's Audio Overviews are now available in over 50 languages earlier this week in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/google-labs/notebooklm-audio-overviews-50-languages/" target="_blank">blog post</a>. The change also added an <strong>Output Language</strong> setting for Audio Overviews that can be separate from your default language, which can be helpful for bilingual and multilingual research and studying.</p>

<p>The last time I checked, there were at least 35 different smart home devices strewn around my house. Most of them are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-led-light-bulbs-work-google-home">smart lights</a> or streaming devices, but I also have a variety of smart speakers, displays, and other devices. Not to mention a few smart cameras that we use to keep an eye on the house and its surroundings if we're gone for more than a few hours.</p><p>The problem is that everything that I've mentioned is controlled by a different app or service. I've tried my best to keep things as tidy as possible, such as relying on Philips Hue for smart light bulbs and a couple of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-security-cameras-store-locally-not-cloud">Nest Cams</a> to monitor the outside of my home.</p><p>However, while I'm okay with having a bunch of different apps installed on my phone, my wife isn't. Every new platform means getting her set up and logged in, then keeping my fingers crossed that everything works the way it's supposed to.</p><p>Recently, I finally said that enough was enough and decided that it was time to dive into Home Assistant. See, I've actually had a Home Assistant instance set up on an old <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/raspberry-pi">Raspberry Pi 4</a> for some time, but I've just been too <del>lazy</del> busy to take the time and finish getting everything set up.</p>

<p>The promise of Home Assistant is that it can act as the central hub for practically any smart device in your abode. And when I say "smart device," I mean almost anything that connects to the internet in some capacity. In addition to that, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whats-home-assistant-and-why-should-home-automation-enthusiasts-consider-it">Home Assistant</a> works with various "protocols" such as Matter, Thread, Zigbee, HomeKit, Nest, etc.</p><p>While improvements have been made to improve multi-protocol integration, none of them have managed to make good on the promise of a seamless smart home. Plus, the only company that seems to even care about releasing new products on a semi-regular cadence has been Amazon. Google's too wrapped up with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/the-switch-from-google-assistant-to-gemini-might-kill-nest-speakers-and-displays">phasing out Assistan</a>t in favor of Gemini, while Apple is content with living inside the Vision Pro.</p>
<h2 id="installing-home-assistant-is-as-easy-2">Installing Home Assistant is as easy</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="58rNzfVoMHP9DHtDVy82JH" name="home-assistant-setup-cli.jpg" alt="Home Assistant setup CLI" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/58rNzfVoMHP9DHtDVy82JH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1686" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As for getting started, you have a few different options. The easiest of which is to just pick up the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CXVKSG19">Home Assistant Green</a>," offering a plug-and-play solution, as you just need to plug in the power and Ethernet to get started. However, if you're willing to do a bit of tinkering, you can install Home Assistant yourself on a single-board computer (SBC), like the Raspberry Pi.</p><p>Or, you can spin up a Virtual Machine on your computer and install it that way. Seriously, there are even more methods, which go to show just how versatile this service really is. No matter what you install Home Assistant on, just make sure it has a constant network connection, otherwise, it'll only work when your computer is turned on.</p><p>As I said before, I have Home Assistant running on a Raspberry Pi that is connected directly to my router. More specifically, I'm actually running the Home Assistant Operating System, as it gives me the flexibility to install and use more integrations than the standard installation would. However, if you're just dipping your toes in the water, I'd recommend either <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/">HA Container or Core</a>.</p>
<h2 id="there-s-so-much-that-you-can-do-2">There's so much that you can do</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6547px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eDuRyAi5FvDenq7Pz6Vn65" name="lenovo-tab-m10-plus-home-assistant-dashboard-2.jpg" alt="Home Assistant Dashboard on Lenovo Tab M10 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eDuRyAi5FvDenq7Pz6Vn65.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6547" height="3683" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Once Home Assistant is running, you're presented with a pretty basic-looking home page, but that's kind of the point. It's not just a way of tying all of your smart home devices together. But it can consolidate all of the switches, toggles, and controls into a single location, removing the headache of flipping through pages of apps.</p><p>But wait! There's more!</p><p>Say you prefer the way that the Google Home app works, but obviously, you couldn't integrate a certain platform. This can solve that problem too! With a bit of time and patience, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.home-assistant.io/cloud/">Home Assistant Cloud</a> and the built-in Voice Assistant feature allow you to "expose entities" so that those incompatible devices will now appear within the Home app. <em>And</em> after the add-on is set up, you're able to control even Apple HomeKit devices using Assistant or Alexa.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2270px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.21%;"><img id="T9xVNfnoPaXAJVDxEXYhn5" name="home-assistant-cloud-features" alt="Home Assistant cloud features overview" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/T9xVNfnoPaXAJVDxEXYhn5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2270" height="1276" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Home Assistant)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The beauty is that this can be something quick that remedies a few pain points, or it can be a weekend project that doesn't really ever end. There are some pretty awesome integrations, such as tracking your Amazon deliveries, setting up a presence-based automation, and even turning your computer on.</p><p>Even after getting everything connected, you can enhance the experience even further by creating a custom dashboard. Some have even gone so far as to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/search/?q=kindle&cId=71a7f272-fe93-425c-a1c4-c9456055323c&iId=bcf6a2fa-3196-4f18-be9f-37bbb6c58545">turn an old Kindle</a> into a basic smart screen that shows the weather and upcoming calendar events, mounted on the wall.</p>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/1kbdip6/boyfriend_introduced_me_to_home_assistant_around/#lightbox"><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4310px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="AsHkhbMFowsFoCLhmnTp2R" name="home-assistant-dashboard-kindle-reddit" alt="Home Assistant running on an Amazon Kindle as a dashboard" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AsHkhbMFowsFoCLhmnTp2R.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4310" height="2426" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: r/homeassistant)</span></figcaption></figure></a>
<p>So if you prefer a more traditional platform like Google Home or Amazon Alexa, you've just supercharged it. But Home Assistant is right there for those who want a truly customizable experience with more built-in functionality than you'll find anywhere else. It provides exactly what we were hoping to see from Matter, but goes further than we could have even thought.</p>

<p>With the recent news about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/im-done-buying-google-nest-products">Google dropping support</a> for the first two Nest Thermostats, paired with very few new product releases, you might be looking outside of the Nest ecosystem. Well, thanks to Home Assistant, it doesn't mean that you'll be left to figure out how to use a completely different app.</p><p>On top of that, the release of Android 14 introduced the ability to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-change-lock-screen-shortcuts-android-14">customize your lock screen shortcuts</a>, meaning that you can replace the Google Home app on your phone with, oh, I don't know, maybe the Home Assistant app. Which is exactly what I've done on both my docked <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Pixel Tablet</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>, and I couldn't be happier. There's even a Home Assistant app for Wear OS, which is really just icing on the cake at this point.</p><p>If you're ready to venture down this rabbit hole, keep things simple, read the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/">documentation</a>, connect the basics, and explore the interface. Once you have a better grasp on what's possible, then let your inner tinkerer run wild and have some fun with it. Just keep in mind that Rome wasn't built in a day, and chances are, neither will your new smart home experience.</p>

<p>Several people have taken to Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://eu.community.samsung.com/t5/galaxy-s24-series/battery-draining-faster-after-one-ui-7-update/td-p/12117659/page/3">forums</a> and Reddit to report significant battery drain issues that are supposedly triggered by the new One UI 7 update. This has been seen specifically by Samsung Galaxy S24 series owners as well as some with the Galaxy Z Fold 6 (first spotted by<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/one-ui-7-triggers-battery-life-crisis-galaxy-s24-fold-6/"> Android Police</a>).</p><p>One UI 7 started<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/samsungs-one-ui-7-finally-resumes-again-expanding-to-more-regions-including-india"> rolling out</a> more widely over the past couple of days after several delays and even a brief pause of the rollout by the company due to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/serious-bug-pushes-samsung-to-stall-one-ui-7-rollout-globally">'serious bug.'</a> However, the problems don't seem to end with this UI.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Fold 6 </a>user on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyFold/comments/1kcr4l1/battery_life_got_worse_with_the_latest_ui7_update/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> said that their battery capacity was basically cut by half following the One UI 7 update: "I now end the day with just 20%-25% battery, down from 45-50% before upgrading," they said.</p>

<p>The story remains the same with some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-ultra-one-month-later">Galaxy S24 Ultra </a>users as well. They saw a huge drop in battery life since installing One UI 7. They stated that they lost close to 20% battery while the phone wasn't in use in less than three hours. Additionally, they're having to plug their phones in for charging more often than not.</p><p>While Samsung hasn't mentioned any such issues with the OS, some users suggest that clearing up cache could help the sitution, while others say that it is common for phones to act out during the first few days of the update. This could be because the device is leaning the user's usage pattern following the upgrade to One UI 7.</p><p>So the suggestion is to give your phone at least a week to settle in, before looking for ways to fix the battery issue. That said, if all else fails and you've passed the seven day mark, other users suggest factory resetting the device. While this sounds like a harsh workaround, it seems to have done the trick for many.</p><p>Android Central has reached out to Samsung about this and will update the article once we have more information.</p>

<ul><li>A Google TV product update revealed a handful of ways the company is improving its experience with an updated setup.</li><li>The post states Hisense’s 2025 U7 series and 2025 U8 series are the first to receive its new "improved app installs" and setup notifications on Android.</li><li>Last September, Google TV received an update that brought the TV Streamer's Home Panel to more users, making it easy to manage your cameras, temperature, and more.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google TV recently detailed a few ways it's revamping its setup experience for users to get them into their shows and movies quicker.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/google-tv/setup-new-google-tv-improvements/">Keyword post</a>, Google's product update says its new setup experience is "faster and easier" for users. This experience brings a handful of changes, but most notably, Google says users can "start watching right away." Google TV's upgraded setup brings "improved app installs," meaning you won't have to wait around for a while as your device prepares.</p><p>Additionally, Google says this upgraded app install method should give users more peace of mind when worrying about their TVs' onboard storage.</p><p>The post states users won't need to download an app to get their Google TV started. Now, during its initial setup, your Android phone will display a notification, which states "Set up your Google TV." Those on iOS will have to scan the on-screen QR code. Moreover, consumers can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googletv/answer/15158065?hl=en">connect eligible smart devices</a> to their Google TV much quicker than before.</p><p>Certain devices, like Google Home speakers, will let users pause their content, search for shows/movies, and more. Lastly, users can "customize" their TV with unique screensavers, parental controls, and individual profiles.</p><p>Google TV concludes by specifying that this new setup experience is "first available" for Hisense’s 2025 U7 series and 2025 U8 series. The company plans to expand coverage to other Google TVs and "select" Onn. streaming products from Walmart "later this year."</p>

<p>Shortly after the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv-streamer-vs-chromecast-with-google-tv-4k">Google TV Streamer</a> launched, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv-updates-control-center-entertainment-smart-home">rolled out an update</a> for Google TV devices. The patch aimed to give users more awareness and control when it came to their home and entertainment. The main highlight was the addition of the "Home Panel," a side-view packed with all of your connected smart home device information and cameras. Users could easily see who was at their door and check on other areas in or around the home without leaving the TV.</p><p>Additionally, the Home Panel on Google TV lets users control their lights and temperature for a complete control center. The experience further progressed with Google's new Sports tab on the "For You" page. The tab was designed to highlight "relevant" sports games, as well as YouTube Highlights.</p><p>While the TV Streamer is the official replacement of the Chromecast, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/chromecast/chromecast-with-google-tv-home-panel-feature-rollout">still rolled out a major update for it</a>. At the end of April, the Chromecast with Google TV dongle received the Home Panel update, bringing much of the smart home connectivity the TV Streamer and Google TV devices have.</p>

<p>Boox appears to be on a product-launching spree. After recently dropping portable e-readers, the company now has a new E Ink monitor dubbed Mira Pro (Color Version), which is now available to purchase.</p><p>It is a 25.3-inch monitor that claims to have paper-like visuals alongside rich colors. The latest monitor is aimed at professionals, programmers, students, and those who spend a lot of time on screens, as it offers an eye-friendly design.</p>

<p>The Mira Pro (Color Version) happens to be the first color monitor and an upgrade over the monochrome Mira Pro. It also features the Kaleidoscope 3 — the same as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/kobo-libra-colour-review">Kobo Libra Color</a> — color ePaper screen that claims to offer soft colors, which should work for tasks demanding color differentiation like “reviewing color-coded dashboards, analyzing data, or working with complex graphics.” The same screen was featured in the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/boox/boox-introduces-new-go-7-series-of-portable-ereaders">Boox Go Color 7 e-reader</a>.</p><p>The massive 25.3-inch can be used as a primary or secondary screen and supports split-screen multitasking. Then there’s adjustable dual-tone front lights to ensure readability in all lighting conditions and further making it eye-friendly.</p><p>The monitor further utilizes Boox Super Refresh technology that increases refresh rates alongside having four preset refresh modes. “The Mira software allows further fine-tuning of Refresh Speed, Dark Color Enhancement, and Light Color Filter for truly customized viewing.”</p>

<ul><li>Rumors suggest there are new Google One AI subscription tiers in the works for consumers.</li><li>These tiers could include a "Gemini Pro" and "Gemini Ultra" plan for consumers, alongside the pre-existing Gemini Advanced option.</li><li>Google recently upgraded Gemini Advanced with NotebookLM Plus and Veo 2 for video generation, but the company also teased more for I/O 2025.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Reports suggest Google is preparing to introduce a couple of new AI subscription plans for Gemini.</p><p>Speculation stems from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.testingcatalog.com/google-prepares-new-gemini-ai-subscription-tiers-with-possible-gemini-ultra-plan/">TestingCatalog</a>, which highlights the findings from a few tipsters on X. According to their discoveries, Google's Gemini code seems to suggest plans for the addition of two new Google One AI subscription tiers. Rumors claim the company could introduce a "Gemini Pro" and "Gemini Ultra" tier in addition to the pre-existing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-advanced-subscribers-can-now-use-gemini-flash-2-0-experimental-in-latest-gemini-app-beta">Gemini Advanced</a> bundle.</p><p>While Gemini's code seemingly points to this, tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/BartokGabi17/status/1917680002319147308">BartokGabi17</a> was able to surface an early preview of the Pro's limitations.</p><p>The post on X showcased a snapshot of an in-app pop-up that read, "You've reached your limit of generated videos." It also encourages the user to either wait for the next month to roll in or "upgrade to Gemini Ultra."</p><p>The publication reiterated a previous claim that Google was developing new "Premium AI Plus" and "Premium AI Pro" plans. With how things have seemingly progressed, there's a chance Google could rename these to better fit with what consumers already know.</p>

<p>The reported tagline about a "monthly limit" for video generation echoes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-veo-2-video-generator-gemini-advanced-whisk-rollout">an update to Gemini Advanced</a> that brought Veo 2. Google warned Advanced subscribers that they wouldn't be able to infinitely produce Veo 2's short, high-quality video clips with Gemini. However, the company didn't state what the ceiling looks like. Instead, Google says Gemini would let you know when you were approaching your limit.</p><p>It will appear as a pop-up, similar to what was found in the latest AI subscription tier leak.</p><p>In other news, Google One's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-ai-premium-plan-just-got-more-appealing-with-new-perks">AI Premium plan was upgraded</a>, giving users a little more bang for their buck. Existing subscribers were granted access to NotebookLM Plus at no extra charge. The update also gives consumers access to Gemini Advance's smarts in Gmail and Docs, alongside 2TB of cloud storage. With so much going on with Gemini — rumors of a "Pro" and "Ultra" tier, too — I/O 2025 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-gemini-io-2025-newsletter-teasers">could have more in store</a> than we realize.</p><p>Google recently teased "new possibilities" inbound for Gemini in a newsletter. While it refused to go into detail, the teaser claimed these new updates would help enhance user "productivity," as well as introduce new "interactions." Of course, this could allude to new additions to the Gemini app and browser experience, but there's a chance more could be announced.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung has announced the start of its "Open Enrollment" period for Galaxy devices in the U.S.</li><li>Users can enroll their device in the Samsung Care Plus with Theft & Loss protection plan, which offers screen and glass back repairs for $0.</li><li>The period is open from May 1 to June 15, but it's only available for the Galaxy S25, S25 Plus, S25 Ultra, Galaxy Z Flip 6, Fold 6, Tab S10 Plus, and Tab S10 Ultra</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung's reportedly feeling a little generous as reports state the company is giving Galaxy owners a new shot at its device protection plan.</p><p>The Korean OEM has started the "Open Enrollment" period for Galaxy owners interested in grabbing Samsung Care Plus, per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/us-galaxy-device-owners-get-another-shot-at-care-protection/">SamMobile</a>. This enrollment period reportedly only concerns consumers in the U.S., delivering Care Plus with Theft & Loss protection.</p><p>Samsung highlights this on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://rg2.samsungcareplus.com/us#/">protection plan's website</a>, stating those enrolling will receive "same-day" cracked screen and glass back repairs for $0.</p><p>At its core, Samsung Care Plus with Theft & Loss provides users with "unlimited drops, spills, and mechanical breakdown" coverage. If your Galaxy device has received damage, Samsung will carry out these repairs at one of its authorized locations. Breakdowns and repairs also include batteries.</p><p>More importantly, Samsung's fine print states this Open Enrollment period isn't available for <em>every </em>Galaxy device. According to the company, consumers with a Galaxy S25, S25 Plus, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">S25 Ultra</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-hands-on">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>, Fold 6, Tab S10 Plus, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review">Tab S10 Ultra</a> can participate. You can attempt to enroll your Galaxy device through the website or, on your phone/tablet, head to <strong>Settings > About Phone > Samsung Care Plus </strong>to check the service's availability.</p><p>This enrollment period is open from May 1 to June 15.</p>

<p>Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-care-plus-theft-and-loss-unlimited-screen-repair-announcement">recently upgraded</a> its Care Plus protection experience in January when it introduced "same-day $0 cracked screen and back glass repairs." This particular brand of device safety regarded consumers who purchased its plan's unlimited subscription. Moreover, Samsung warned users that its same-day modifier may only be available for eligible devices in "select" areas.</p><p>Likely, this is still the case, no matter Samsung's brief second chance enrollment period.</p><p>What happened earlier this year was the second major Samsung Care Plus update, after the company brought <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-care-plus-unlimited-battery-repair-notification">unlimited battery repair support</a> in 2024. Eligible consumers were those with Samsung Care Plus with Loss and Theft or the standard Care Plus plan. The specifics state that your battery is eligible for repair/replacement if it can no longer charge above 79%.</p><p>However, if your battery's suffered "additional damage," it will void the chance of repair.</p>

The green options and money-saving bits are pretty cool, and I like how it can set temperatures higher or lower when the house is empty. But I love being able to change everything from my phone. I don't have to try and haul myself upstairs because I'm chilly, and that makes a difference.</p><p>Then Google comes along and ruins everything by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/google-is-dropping-support-for-the-first-two-generations-of-nest-learning-thermostat">dropping support for it</a>. It will still work if I haul myself up those stairs where I can touch it, but what I need (really, what many disabled people need) is going away, and I won't be able to control it through an app on my phone. What the hell, Google?</p>
<p>Needless to say, I'll be buying another smart thermostat because they do make my life better. But it won't be a Nest. In fact, I'm done buying Google's smart home stuff for good. Ecobee has what <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/2025-ecobee-Smart-Thermostat-Essential/dp/B0DT9MC2Z9/" target="_blank">looks like a good option</a>, and maybe even Honeywell makes something that doesn't use a terrible app interface, so I'm exploring.</p>

<p>I do understand how the consumer electronics game works (yes, it's a game and you never win), so I don't expect Google to continue to provide active support for a 10-year-old product. I'm not asking for that, especially for free.</p><p>But why remove the most useful and basic feature? Why not offer an option to use it until it breaks without seeing any significant updates? Why not offer a service I can pay for to keep using it like Microsoft does for older, but critical, products? The only reason I can think of is that you know people will buy a new one. That's both evil and shitty.</p>

<p>A thermostat is not <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">a phone</a>. The thermostat I replaced with my Nest was <strong>30 years old</strong>. It worked fine, even though it never once got any sort of wild electronic update because mercury switches and thermocouples don't need them. A Nest thermostat doesn't <em>need</em> any updates either, once things work as expected. They just arrived to bring new features.</p><p>Keep those features. Google never once sent me one I asked for because I never asked. I want a thermostat to work the way it's supposed to work out of the box and to keep working that way until some random act of an angry god makes it stop.</p><p>I know "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence" target="_blank">planned obsolescence</a>" is a longstanding tech conspiracy theory, and I try not to buy into those. But in this case, nothing else fits. Maybe all this is because <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> is replacing other things, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-home">Google Home app</a> needs to change. Maybe it's something else.</p><p>What I do know is that I don't care. I just want to be able to change the temp without touching the thermostat like I've been doing for 10 years.</p>

Fortunately for budget-friendly buyers, Amazon has slashed a whopping <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Soundcore-Wireless-Bluetooth-Water-Resistant-Customization/dp/B0BTYDLTM3"><strong>50% off the SoundCore by Anker P20i true wireless earbuds,</strong></a> which still come with many modern listening features despite going for a mere $20 with this discount.</p><p>The SoundCore P20i wireless earbuds come with a charging case offering up to 30 hours of playback time, two microphones for phone calls and voice commands, and a mobile app that lets listeners pick from 22 preset equalization settings. Without the use of the charging case, these buds can get around 10 hours of battery life per charge, while charging them for just 10 minutes will net you around two hours of playtime, according to Anker. While buyers will miss out on features like active noise cancellation, that's not a big surprise considering the low price point.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you're looking for a serious deal on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">wireless headphones</a> or earbuds; you don't need super premium earbuds, just some that will get the job done; you want a pair of buds that has quick charging and a decent battery life with a charging case.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you need a pair of earbuds with active noise cancellation; you'd prefer to go with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">best wireless earbuds </a>available, regardless of high price tags; you want wireless over-ear headphones instead.</p><p>The Soundcore by Anker P20i wireless earbuds won't win any awards for innovation, but they sport an impressive number of features for having such an entry-level price point. For one, they come with a charging case that will get users up to 30 hours of playtime with intermittent use, while the buds on their own can offer up to 10 hours of battery life. Users can also customize the audio profile of the earbuds using Anker's mobile app, which offers 22 separate EQ profiles.</p><p>These sport a pretty healthy frequency range of 20 to 20,000 Hz, and while they won't sound like the industry-leading brand name options, most casual users can get what they need from them. The biggest downside is the lack of inclusion of ANC, which could be a dealbreaker for some, and especially those with a bigger budget to spend.</p>

However, instead of just two phones, Motorola launched three Razr 2025 models, taking more of a Samsung approach by emulating the Galaxy S lineup to an extent.</p><p>The lineup now consists of the Razr 2025, Razr Plus 2025, and the Razr Ultra 2025. Unlike Samsung's Galaxy S lineup, these phones feature different specs and other design changes to set them apart from each other. It also helps Motorola target different price points, so there's a model for everyone.</p><p>With that in mind, which Razr 2025 model should you buy if you're looking to get in on Motorola's next flip phones? This article will try to help steer you in the right direction so you can make an informed choice when the phones go on sale.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Denu4EfRCdzoo6borEdDZQ" name="Motorola-Razr-2025-hands-on-2" alt="Three Razr 2025 phones stacked on top of each other" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Denu4EfRCdzoo6borEdDZQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Razr 2025 is for anyone looking for an affordable flip phone that won't break the bank, yet still offers good performance. This is the most affordable Razr model, which costs the same as last year's model, although with a few notable upgrades that may make it a more attractive buy.</p><p>While the phone itself looks nearly identical, the phone has a stronger hinge and comes with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-7400-7400x-ultra-efficient-gaming-ai-chips">MediaTek Dimensity 7400X</a> chipset, which launched fairly recently as a mid-range AI-ready chip. It's seemingly a modest upgrade from the Dimensity 7300X in the Razr 2024, but with a focus on efficiency, users can probably expect pretty good battery life, especially with the larger 4,500mAh battery.</p><p>For more power, you'll want either the Razr Plus or Ultra.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="UciUWMuPWhajyHcQaw3GCQ" name="Motorola-Razr-2025-hands-on-4" alt="The Razr 2025 with Moto AI on the cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UciUWMuPWhajyHcQaw3GCQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Razr 2025, of course, comes with a large 3.6-inch cover screen, which isn't as large as the cover screen on the other Razr models, but is still great for checking notifications, opening apps, and taking selfies.</p><p>And speaking of selfies, the Pantone-validated cameras should be much improved over <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2024-review">last year's Razr model</a>, thanks to better color and skin tone reproduction. They likely won't be the best photos, which is what you'll want the Razr Ultra 2025 for, but at this price point, they're unlikely to disappoint.</p><p>Foldables are generally fairly expensive, but Motorola has managed to develop "affordable" flip phones that don't cost $1000. Android Central's Jerry Hildenbrand was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-havent-switched-phones-for-almost-a-year-and-i-love-it">more than happy with his decision to buy the Razr 2024</a>, and while the Razr 2025 is likely to be just as good a buy, it might be even better to wait until it goes on sale. And given Motorola's track record, that may happen soon and often.</p>

<p>The Motorola Razr Plus 2025 is designed for those seeking a well-rounded flip phone that delivers flagship performance without the premium price tag. It's the most curious entry of the bunch as it's literally just a refresh of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus 2024</a>. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but it makes one wonder whether they should just go for last year's model instead.</p><p>You can check out our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-plus-2025-vs-razr-plus-2024">Razr Plus 2025 vs. Razr Plus 2024</a> comparison for a breakdown of the similarities and differences between the phones. That said, the Razr Plus 2025 isn't a bad phone by any means... it just doesn't do the best job making a case for itself.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4214px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="wZDVDLRL6HzK2sW8MUhALe" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-hands-on-23" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 next to the Razr Plus 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wZDVDLRL6HzK2sW8MUhALe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4214" height="2370" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The phone is powered by a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8s-gen-3-announced">Snapdragon 8s Gen 3</a>, which is a sub flagship chip just under the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a>. It performs well, especially paired with 12GB of RAM, so you shouldn't have any concerns there. The phone also has pretty great displays that are plenty bright and with high refresh rates.</p><p>The cover screen is one of our favorite things about the Razr Plus 2024, so we're glad to see it back on the 2025 model. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-set-up-use-motorola-razr-cover-screen-apps">Apps on the cover screen</a> are much more expansive than on the Razr 2025, and the high refresh rate makes them feel more fluid.</p>

<p>A potential miss here is the camera system. You'll get some good (though not the best) photos with the Razr Plus 2024, and thanks to the Pantone-validated cameras on the Razr Plus 2025, we expect to see some improvements in that area. However, the phone still has a 2x telephoto lens, even though <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025-needs-to-ditch-telephoto-camera">we'd prefer an ultrawide sensor</a> for the secondary camera, something you'd get with the other Razr phones.</p><p>The Razr Plus 2025 will retail for $999 when it hits store shelves, and will be available in three different hues.</p>

<p>The Razr Ultra 2025 is for those of you looking for a top-of-the-line flip phone. Not only that, but it may be among the most impressive smartphones that we've seen so far this year, which is reflected in its price tag.</p><p>At $1,300, this phone doesn't come cheap, and you'll be spending about as much as you would for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>. At a price like that, it's easy to turn away and go for something less pricey, like the Razr 2025 or Razr Plus 2025. So, what does it bring to the table that makes it cost so much?</p><p>First off, you're getting the top-of-the-line <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> chip found on other flagship devices this year. It's paired with 16GB of RAM, which is more than anyone needs but should be plenty to power its various AI features, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">on-device AI processing</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="Y3NDvDc299CDy8eXWJcB6b" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-official-render-Snapdragon-8-Elite" alt="Razr Ultra 2025 with the Snapragon 8 Elite chip inside" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Y3NDvDc299CDy8eXWJcB6b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8000" height="8000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Speaking of AI, this phone gets all the new features coming to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a>, a few of which you won't find on the cheaper Razr 2025 models. That includes Look and Talk, an impressive feature that lets you simply look at the phone while in tent or stand mode to start talking to the AI assistant. You don't even need a wake word; it'll just start listening and responding to you.</p><p>And if you're like me and don't like using the power button to evoke the AI assistant, the new AI Key is a separate button that lets you customize it with different Moto AI actions, something you also won't find on the cheaper Razr models.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3890px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BdFpuBqFWpbE76gqdtgn3c" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-hands-on-06" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 cover screen with Moto AI "Listening..."" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BdFpuBqFWpbE76gqdtgn3c.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3890" height="2188" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Ultra also gets a higher-resolution Super HD+ display with higher peak brightness. Like the cameras, the display is Pantone-validated, which should further set the display apart from the other models.</p><p>Furthermore, compared to the other Razr phones, it has the largest battery, fastest charging, and arguably a more capable camera system with three 50MP sensors.</p><p>Lastly, the color options are the most unique I've seen. Cabaret and Rio Red are cute, but you'll be hard-pressed to find other phones with options like Alcantara (Scarab) or real wood (Mountain Trail). That alone is enough to consider the Ultra over its cheaper siblings.</p>

That means you can talk with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> conversationally while also adding visual details for context. Best of all, it'll work on virtually any Android phone, so long as you have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One</a> AI Premium subscription.</p><p>If you're curious about sharing your screen or live camera feed with Gemini or want to get an idea of when multimodal <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/gemini-live-real-time-screen-sharing-now-available-to-all-android-users">Gemini Live</a> might come in handy, this guide has you covered.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-need-to-use-gemini-live-with-live-video-and-screen-sharing-2">What you need to use Gemini Live with live video and screen sharing</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KcR7JnGvLMXQrMQfZThmBk" name="Gemini-Live-S25-Pixel-9" alt="Gemini Live on the Galaxy S25 and the Pixel 9." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KcR7JnGvLMXQrMQfZThmBk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Since Gemini Live is processed off-device, there are very few hardware requirements for the feature. It merely requires an Android device with 2 GB of RAM or more and Android 10 or newer. Of course, you should consider what you share with Gemini Live because it is leaving your device and being analyzed in the cloud. It isn't recommended to share private or identifying information with Gemini Live.</p><p>Additionally, most users will need to pay for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One AI Premium</a> to gain access to Gemini Live's camera and screen sharing features, since multimodality is currently a Gemini Advanced exclusive. With that being said, it's completely free for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Google Pixel 9</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Samsung Galaxy S25</a> series phones. You may have also received a Gemini Advanced trial period with your device, if it's a newer Pixel.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-share-a-live-video-feed-with-gemini-2">How to share a live video feed with Gemini</h2>
<p>Gemini Live could already have a conversation with you in a natural tone, but it can now take in objects in your surroundings for additional context when you share your live camera feed. Here's how to do it:</p>
<p>1. Launch Gemini by <strong>opening the app</strong> or <strong>long-pressing the power button</strong>.</p><p>2. Press the <strong>Live icon</strong> near the bottom of your screen.</p><p>3. Tap the <strong>Camera button</strong>.</p><p>4. Make sure the things you want to ask Gemini about are <strong>inside the camera's viewfinder</strong>.</p><p>5. <strong>Begin asking questions</strong> about the subject.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="gu7pUpii5SdrHTHGeoZeT9" name="Gemini-Live-Video-Streaming-Guide" alt="How to share your camera feed with Gemini Live." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gu7pUpii5SdrHTHGeoZeT9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Gemini is particularly good at identifying things you may not know the name of and providing more details about them. For instance, I used an old iPod Shuffle in the above example, and theoretically, I could've just used Google Search to find the answer. That only works if you know the name of the thing you're asking about, but Gemini Live can help <em>without</em> any known details just by using the camera.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-share-your-screen-with-gemini-2">How to share your screen with Gemini</h2>
<p>You can also share your screen with Gemini if there's something on your phone or tablet that could aid your conversation with Live. Currently, Google only supports sharing the entire screen with Live — you can't share a portion of the screen or limit it to a specific app. Here's how to get started:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Open the app, article, or screen</strong> you want to ask Gemini Live about.</p><p>2. <strong>Long-press the power button</strong> to activate Gemini.</p><p>3. Press <strong>Share screen with Live</strong>.</p><p>4. <strong>Begin asking Gemini Live questions</strong> about your screen.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="W4LK2rDJprUFxfuzgs7hgX" name="Gemini-Live-Share-Screen-Guide" alt="Sharing your screen with Gemini Live." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/W4LK2rDJprUFxfuzgs7hgX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When your screen is shared, Gemini can summarize what's on it, answer questions about it, and more. It's like if voice-only Gemini Live was combined with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>. Gemini Live can identify things you might see in an article or on social media and provide more information about them.</p>

<p>Gemini Live's new multimodal features, including live video streaming and screen sharing, can come in handy any time you'd have to describe something at length for context. Instead of telling, you can show Gemini what you're asking about using the camera or screen sharing. It brings Gemini on par with competing services like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/new-meta-ai-app-provides-llama-4-powered-challenge-to-gemini">Meta AI</a> or OpenAI's GPT-4o.</p><p>Plus, it's included on the newest Pixels and Galaxy phones, and available as a subscription for most other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> still in use.</p>

<hr>
<p>A new analysis by app intelligence provider <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://appfigures.com/" target="_blank">Appfigures</a> shows that Google's Play Store has been losing apps since the start of 2024. The report states that the Android app marketplace was home to  3.4 million apps worldwide, but the number dipped to around 1.8 million in just one year (as first reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/29/google-play-sees-47-decline-in-apps-since-start-of-last-year/">TechCrunch</a>).</p><p>That's nearly half (47%) of the apps deleted from the Play Store, and according to Google, this is good news for Android users.</p><p>"This reflects the company’s focus on delivering high-quality apps” and “commitment to continuous improvements for user safety,” said a Google spokesperson to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/658932/google-play-store-lost-half-apps">The Verge.</a></p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HJfw9eZvHip6bAEjYk9ZdS" name="Google-Play-Protect" alt="Play Protect on the Google Play Store" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HJfw9eZvHip6bAEjYk9ZdS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Back in March, the Google Play Store was impacted by a<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-mass-app-deletion-underway-confirmed"> massive ad fraud</a> that made users download "vapor apps" disguised as genuine popular apps. These ran recurring ads, making it difficult for users to delete and generating tons of revenue for fraudsters. This impacted over 56 million downloads that spanned across 180 apps,  and the only way to practically fix this issue was by deleting the apps that caused it.</p><p>Tech Crunch added that Google confirmed its new policies were at play here, "which also included an expanded set of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2023/07/boosting-trust-and-transparency-in-google-play.html" target="_blank">verification requirements</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2023/11/ensuring-high-quality-apps-on-google-play.html#:~:text=Required%20app%20testing" target="_blank">required app testing</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2023/11/ensuring-high-quality-apps-on-google-play.html#:~:text=Increased%20investment%20in%20app%20review" target="_blank">expanded human reviews</a> to check for apps that try to deceive or defraud users."</p>

<p>As seen in the image above, 200,000 app tiles that were removed from the Google Play Store were in the “games” category, followed by 160,700 in education, and 115,400 in business, The Verge noted.</p><p>Why is this a good thing? For users, this significant cleanup makes the Play Store less cluttered with unwanted spammy apps and makes it easier for users to find genuine apps. As for developers, the reduction of apps makes it only easier for users to find their apps, with less noise from low-quality or scam apps.</p><p>That said, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play-store/google-is-using-ai-to-safeguard-play-store">has been ramping up its efforts</a> to track down malicious apps and is "working on ways to make it even harder for malicious actors to hide or trick users into harmful installs, which will not only protect your business from fraud but also help users download your apps with confidence."</p>

<p>Motorola's Razr Plus used to be the top of the line when it came to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phones</a>, but with the company's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-series-hands-on">Razr 2025 series</a>, the Plus now sits squarely in the middle. With the Razr 2025 below it and the Razr Ultra 2025 as the premium offering, the Razr Plus 2025 is more of a direct successor to last year's Plus model than the Ultra is, and you'd be forgiven if you thought these two phones were the same.</p><p>Of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025">Razr 2025 series</a>, the Plus seems most similar to its predecessor. There are some differences between them, which this Razr Plus 2025 vs. Razr Plus 2024 comparison will attempt to highlight. This way, you can decide whether last year's phone is still worth picking up or if you want this year's Razr Plus. Let's dive in.</p>

<p>Before we compare the differences between these two phones, let's review everything that remains unchanged between generations. Unsurprisingly, this is a much longer list of things, and as you can see from the table below, many of the specs are practically unchanged between the two phones.</p><p>Like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus 2024</a>, the newer Razr Plus 2025 is powered by the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3, a sub-flagship chip that's more than capable of getting the job done, although it's clearly a step down from the more powerful <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> or even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">8 Gen 3</a>. Both phones also have 12GB of RAM, which should keep things running smoothly.</p><p>Display specs, such as resolution and peak brightness, are the same for both internal and external screens, while the camera sensors and battery capacity are unchanged. Even the phone dimensions are exactly the same, highlighting just how similar these two phones are.</p>

<p>I'll reiterate that while the above specs are identical between the two phones, they're not bad specs by any means. In our use, the 4,000mAh battery on the Razr is capable of keeping the phone powered throughout the day without constantly needing to seek out a charger. And for the moments when you do need a top-up, the 45W charging speed is faster than many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Galaxy phones</a>.</p><p>The cameras are also quite decent, although we're disappointed to see that Motorola has stuck with the 2x telephoto sensor for the secondary camera. We would have preferred an ultrawide camera to get the best of both worlds, but Motorola clearly wanted to make as few changes as possible.</p><p>That said, let's move on to the things that <em>are</em> different with the new Razr Plus 2025.</p>
<h2 id="motorola-razr-plus-2025-vs-razr-plus-2024-what-s-different-2">Motorola Razr Plus 2025 vs. Razr Plus 2024: What's different?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4214px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="wZDVDLRL6HzK2sW8MUhALe" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-hands-on-23" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 next to the Razr Plus 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wZDVDLRL6HzK2sW8MUhALe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4214" height="2370" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Razr Ultra 2025 (right) next to the Razr Plus 2025 (left). </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>So what makes the Razr Plus 2025 even worth buying over the Razr Plus 2024? After all, these phones are practically identical, right? Well, yes and no.</p><p>Here are some notable differences between the two phones:</p>
<p><strong>A new hinge:</strong> The Razr Plus 2025 features an improved titanium hinge, which promises increased durability. Furthermore, the phone can open and close much more easily, thanks to reduced spring tension, making it better for one-handed use.</p><p><strong>A better display:</strong> Although the display specs may be the same, there's one key way the display on the Razr Plus 2025 is actually superior to that of the 2024 model. The improved hinge means that there is even less of a crease, which is impressive given how it's nearly non-existent on the 2024 model. As this is a concern for many considering their first flip phone, it could make this phone a much more appealing option.</p><p><strong>Camera improvements:</strong> The camera specs are also identical between both phones, but Motorola has enhanced the way the Razr Plus 2025 cameras capture colors. The phone is among the first to feature Pantone-validated cameras, meaning color reproduction and skin tones should appear much better on the newer model.</p><p><strong>Better protection:</strong> Both Razr Plus models feature water resistance, but the Razr Plus 2025 takes it a step further, surpassing its predecessor's IPX8 rating with an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/is-the-motorola-razr-2025-waterproof">IP48 certification</a>. This means the phone is protected from solid particles larger than 1mm, although it does not necessarily protect the phone from dust ingress. This added protection is also a result of the new and improved hinge.</p>

<p><strong>Software and AI:</strong> At launch, the Razr Plus 2025 will ship with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> pre-installed. Unfortunately, owners of the Razr Plus 2024 are still waiting for the update, despite it having already been released for the Razr Plus 2023. Since they share the same update promise, the Razr Plus 2025 will be eligible for Android 18 and updates until 2029. The Razr Plus 2024 will only be eligible for Android 17, with support ending in 2028.</p><p>Motorola also highlights the new and improved <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a> suite, which features enhanced capabilities and AI integrations. However, it's unclear how many of these features will be available on the older phone, despite having the same chipset.</p><p><strong>Colors</strong>: The Razr Plus 2024 and Razr Plus 2025 have many of the same available hues, although the newer model is oddly missing some. They both share Hot Pink, Midnight Blue, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-2024-razr-plus-pantone-rich-mocha-shade">Mocha Mousse</a>, while the 2024 model also comes in Peach Fuzz and Spring Green, with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-paris-pink-limited-edition-launch">limited edition Paris Pink</a> also available.</p>

<p>Given how identical these two phones are, there's no right or wrong answer here. On the one hand, the Razr Plus 2025 is technically the newer phone, meaning it will get updates for an additional year after support ends for its predecessor. It also has some under-the-hood improvements that should enhance things like the display, camera, and overall durability. Those could be enough to consider the Razr Plus 2025 over its predecessor.</p><p>On the other hand, the Razr Plus 2024 is still a great phone and is set to continue receiving updates for a few years. It has the same specs as its successor, and you'll likely be able to find it in more colors and at a much cheaper price point (it's currently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.motorola.com/us/en/p/phones/razr/razr-plus-gen-2/pmipmgs38mh?pn=PB2J0004US">$200 off at Motorola.com</a> at the time of writing).</p><p>Of course, you could also choose one of the other Razr models from this year if you're really looking for a new flip phone.

<h2 id="will-samsung-up-its-software-promise-with-the-galaxy-z-fold-7-2">Will Samsung up its software promise with the Galaxy Z Fold 7?</h2>
<p>Despite many changes to the way Google and its partners will deliver Android OS upgrades over the past year, Samsung is not expected to expand the software update promise on the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>. Like the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and the current Galaxy S25 series, the brand's next foldable will likely get seven years of full OS updates and security patches. If true, this would mean the Galaxy Z Fold 7 would receive updates and bug fixes through at least 2032.</p><p>Qualcomm and Google recently made a joint announcement about plans to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-does-qualcomm-and-googles-8-years-of-android-support-promise-mean-for-us">offer up to eight years of software support</a> for Android phones powered by the latest Snapdragon chipsets.</p><p>While this would theoretically include the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and its expected <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite processor</a>, it's still up to individual manufacturers to extend their support window. It's possible that Samsung offers a longer support window for the Galaxy Z Fold 7, but we haven't heard any rumors or leaks indicating that so far.</p>

<p>Instead, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-z-fold-7-thinner-folded-profile-speculation-report">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 might ship with an "extra" software update</a> in an interesting fashion. Samsung's foldables typically ship with an existing version of One UI. For instance, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 launched with One UI 6, which already debuted on the Galaxy S24 series. This time around, Samsung could ship the Galaxy Z Fold 7 with One UI 8, making it the first Android 16-based Galaxy phone.</p><p>Samsung had numerous issues bringing One UI 7, based on Android 15, to older Galaxy phones. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-new-android-16-release-schedule-and-why-it-matters" target="_blank">new changes to the Android rollout schedule</a> mean that Android 16 will be ready in plenty of time for the expected launch of the Galaxy Z Fold 7. This is how Samsung might beat the odds and deliver <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-one-ui-8-alleged-early-preview-report">One UI 8</a> on the Galaxy Z Fold 7 out of the box.</p><p>We'll likely learn more about Samsung's software plans as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-summer-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">summer Galaxy Unpacked event</a> gets closer, courtesy of rumors and leaks. Until then, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 is still one of the best foldables money can buy.</p>

It can be used on iPhone or Android phones, tablets, laptops, and desktop computers. It's an incredibly versatile piece of software, but that means you may end up using Google Meet on a device with a poor-quality webcam or in a situation with bad lighting.</p><p>Luckily, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-meet-color-sampling-tile-redesign-rolls-out">Google Meet</a> has a few built-in features that use AI and other tricks to virtually improve your appearance. These include virtual backgrounds, background blurs, portrait touch-ups, and studio lighting effects. This guide will teach you how to use all or a mix of these features to make yourself look better in all your Google Meet calls.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-need-to-use-google-meet-s-video-enhancement-features-2">What you need to use Google Meet's video enhancement features</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="m9QXb2msRvwobrjVmahtPD" name="Google-Meet-on-Android-TV.jpg" alt="Google Meet homepage on Android TV" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/m9QXb2msRvwobrjVmahtPD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The various Google Meet video enhancement features each have different system requirements. For virtual backgrounds and effects, you must use an Android 9.0 or higher device. Google says supported devices include the "Samsung Galaxy S9 and up, Pixel 3 and up, and other similar devices."</p><p>You can also make use of studio lighting effects if you're on a desktop operating system and are enrolled in the Workspace Labs program. Google lists the following system requirements for studio lighting features:</p>
<ul><li>A browser version that supports enhanced video:<ul><li><strong>Windows, Mac, or Linux:</strong> Chrome version M114 and up or Firefox 110 and up. <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95414">Learn how to check your browser version</a>.</li><li><strong>ChromeOS:</strong> Version M114 and up. <a href="https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/177889">Learn how to upgrade your Chromebook</a>.</li><li><strong>Windows or Mac:</strong> Edge (Chromium) 114 and up.</li></ul></li><li><strong>For studio lighting:</strong> You must have processor that is equivalent or more performant than Intel Core i9-9880H (8C/16T), Intel Core i5-1235U (2P8E/12T), AMD Ryzen 5 5500U (6C/12T), and Apple M1 (4P4E/8T)</li><li>A browser that supports WebGL.</li><li>Hardware acceleration turned on.</li></ul>
<p>Additionally, Google warns that these features may use more battery life.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-set-a-virtual-background-in-google-meet-2">How to set a virtual background in Google Meet</h2>
<p>The most basic way to improve your appearance in Google Meet is to use background blur, or set a virtual background. This feature is available on most devices and is a quick and easy way to limit the effects of bad lighting or a distracting environment. Here's how to do it:</p>
<p>1. Open the <strong>Google Meet app</strong> and <strong>join a meeting</strong>.</p><p>2. Tap the <strong>Effects </strong>button overlayed on your camera view. It looks like a character icon with a star near the top right corner.</p><p>3. The <strong>Effects drawer</strong> will open to the <strong>Backgrounds tab </strong>by default.</p><p>4. Under <strong>Blur and uploads</strong>, choose <strong>Slightly blur</strong> (left), <strong>Blur</strong> (middle), or <strong>Upload</strong> (right). Your camera preview will update as you select each option, so you can see which one you prefer.</p><p>5. Alternatively, scroll to select a <strong>virtual background</strong>. You can generate a background with AI, choose a suggested background, or upload your own.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HJupe48ns8h3NyFQszQRhY" name="Google-Meet-Background-Blur-Steps" alt="Setting virtual backgrounds and using background blur in Google Meet." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HJupe48ns8h3NyFQszQRhY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>After that, you'll now have either a blurred version of your real-life background or a virtual one. This will eliminate distracting elements in your surroundings and shift the focus to your own appearance, and can negate the effects of bad lighting conditions.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use-portrait-touch-up-in-google-meet-2">How to use portrait touch-up in Google Meet</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1226px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:48.94%;"><img id="HjNySUC8hvyGV77PzJGr6n" name="google-meet-portrait-touch-up.jpg" alt="Google Meet Portrait touch up for web" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HjNySUC8hvyGV77PzJGr6n.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1226" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another handy Google Meet feature that'll improve your looks is called portrait touch-up. It's available on mobile devices and the web, and will slightly smooth out your complexion with two modes, as explained by Google:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Subtle:</strong> very light complexion smoothing, under eye lightening and eye whitening.</li><li><strong>Smoothing:</strong> slightly more complexion smoothing, under eye lightening and eye whitening.</li></ul>
<p>Like setting a virtual background or using background blur, this will positively affect your facial appearance. However, portrait touch-up specifically uses software to smooth your complexion and brighten your face, so it'll do more to improve your appearance. Here's how to use it:</p>
<p>1. Open the <strong>Google Meet app</strong> and <strong>join a meeting</strong>.</p><p>2. Tap the <strong>Effects </strong>button overlayed on your camera view. It looks like a character icon with a star near the top right corner.</p><p>3. The <strong>Effects drawer</strong> will open to the <strong>Backgrounds tab </strong>by default. Switch to the <strong>Appearance tab</strong> by tapping it.</p><p>4. Pick either the <strong>Subtle</strong> or <strong>Smoothening</strong> portrait touch-up effect, and optionally pick a style. The styles can further brighten up your face, so it is recommended if you are in a place with poor lighting.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PCrdqgQCjaJ7khu45xWTG8" name="Google-Meet-Portrait-TouchUP" alt="Enabling portrait touch-up in Google Meet." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PCrdqgQCjaJ7khu45xWTG8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, you'll have a brighter portrait and a smoother facial complexion for your Google Meet calls.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use-studio-look-and-studio-lighting-2">How to use Studio look and Studio lighting</h2>
<p>Studio look and Studio lighting are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-meet-combining-backgrounds-and-filters">two work-in-progress features</a> that are limited to Google Workspace Labs testers and supported desktop browsers. You can enroll for Workspace Labs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspace.google.com/labs-sign-up/" target="_blank">here</a>. As such, most people won't be able to use them. But if you are on a supported device with a Workspace Labs account, here's how you can:</p>
<p>1. Open <strong>Google Meet</strong> in a supported browser and get ready to join a meeting, but <strong>don't leave the green room</strong>.</p><p>2. At the bottom of your camera feed preview, click the <strong>Apply visual effects</strong> button.</p><p>3. From there, select the <strong>Appearance tab</strong>.</p><p>4. Under <strong>Studio lighting</strong>, flip the toggle to enable it and choose either <strong>custom</strong> or <strong>auto</strong> mode. With custom mode, you can change the position of your virtual lights, their tones, and brightness.</p><p>5. Under <strong>Studio</strong> <strong>look</strong>, flip the toggle to "improve detail" and "show you more clearly."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:62.50%;"><img id="tEV75eBhwQyuefoENz8g4M" name="Google-Meet-Studio.gif" alt="Google Meet studio lighting adjustments interface" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tEV75eBhwQyuefoENz8g4M.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1280" height="800" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>These features can do a whole lot to improve lighting and clarity, so if you're using a device with a bad webcam, consider signing up for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-calendars-web-client-gains-a-gemini-in-workspace-side-panel">Workspace Labs</a> on a desktop computer.</p>
<h2 id="when-to-use-google-meet-s-software-features-to-improve-your-appearance-2">When to use Google Meet's software features to improve your appearance</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="b7fksiia7qx6tJsTKM89UX" name="Google-Meet-logo.jpg" alt="Google Meet logo on laptop" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b7fksiia7qx6tJsTKM89UX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google Meet's video features can help you reduce visual distractions, improve your appearance, and make your video feed brighter. Virtual backgrounds and background blurs can help make your face the focus of a meeting, eliminating messy backgrounds or poor lighting. Meanwhile, portrait touch-up will smooth out your complexion, potentially giving you more confidence.</p><p>These are all available on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">latest Android phones</a>, and you should use them whenever you can. Remember, you'll need to set these for each meeting you join, but it'll only take a few seconds in Google Meet's "green room."</p><p>Finally, Studio look and Studio lighting are limited but helpful features, and it's possible they come to more Google Meet users in the future.</p>

<p>"Higher tariffs and more complex trade structures will be a normal part of business going forward," Pemble warned at the start of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www8.garmin.com/aboutGarmin/invRelations/reports/2025_Q1_Earnings_Call_Transcript.pdf">earnings call</a>.</p><p>A quarter of Garmin's U.S. revenue comes from products assembled in Taiwan, with a 10% baseline tariff once the temporary exemption expires. While they don't use a "significant amount of material" from China, reciprocal tariffs will "weaken the U.S. dollar," which makes up 60% of their profits.</p><p>Garmin's CFO says that of the "estimated $100 million of increased costs from tariffs" in 2025, they will be "mostly offset by expected favorable foreign currency impacts and planned mitigations." To the first point, Garmin believes that non-U.S. dollar currencies will strengthen, so its 40% of EMEA and Asia business will have inflated value.</p><p>However, it's much less specific about its "mitigation" plans. Pemble says that Garmin is "pursuing mitigations, some of which have already been established, while others will take more time. We are not ruling anything out, and we intend to be strategic and selective with these actions."</p><p>Pemble refused to say what these mitigations are (or will be), but it's not hard to surmise.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-connect-plus-in-depth-hands-on-much-more-than-an-ai-unfortunately">Garmin Connect Plus</a>, for all its negative press and customer outrage, is an example of successful "mitigation" that's already begun. A subscription gives Garmin a new revenue source, making post-launch updates more profitable as they increasingly fall behind a paywall.</p><p>During the earnings call, Pemble said that the AI boom made it the "right time" to launch Connect Plus, that "the response has been positive," and that "this is a long-term thing for us, a very important part of our Fitness segment going forward."</p><p>I'm not so sure about the positive response, but Garmin customers would probably prefer this optional nickel-and-dime solution to squeeze out more money over higher watch prices.</p><p>I doubt it's a coincidence that Garmin upped its Fitness "revenue growth estimate" from 10% to 15% after just one quarter, so quickly after the Connect Plus launch and with no new major products besides the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/leaked-garmin-vivoactive-6-looks-and-sounds-pretty-similar-to-its-predecessor">Vivoactive 6</a>, which made few upgrades over its predecessor.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ZZBTbeicHteBzFibiwPv8X" name="IMG_9788" alt="A Walking activity on the Garmin Instinct 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZZBTbeicHteBzFibiwPv8X.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Outdoor category had Garmin's biggest YoY revenue boost with $72.3 million. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Garmin Fenix 8</a>'s continued popularity is the main reason, but the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-cant-decide-if-the-garmin-instinct-3-is-a-triumph-or-a-letdown">Instinct 3</a> was another factor; it added an AMOLED display and better battery life but otherwise kept to the status quo with older sensors and few feature changes for a high price.</p><p>Garmin's 2025 strategy with the Instinct 3 and Vivoactive 6 shows Garmin's more subtle, in-progress strategy: sticking to a consistent release schedule while offering fewer improvements per generation, so it can tempt customers to upgrade more often without worrying about significant innovation.</p><p>The fact that Garmin hasn't given its latest watches the Elevate v5 sensor feels like proof of this system. Garmin counts on its brand strength and popular training tools to tempt people enough that they ignore the ways that Garmin falls short of other brands, like not offering ECGs or offline maps on its cheaper watches.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="TLrgkb32YSqxBvN99HLNBa" name="Garmin-Fenix-8-HRV-status" alt=""Last night HRV" graph on the Garmin Fenix 8" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TLrgkb32YSqxBvN99HLNBa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Garmin customers have already shown they'll pay inflated prices with the Fenix 8's success </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>"Everything is on the table," Pemble said when asked about increased Garmin watch pricing to mitigate tariffs. But that doesn't mean <em>every</em> Garmin watch will be more expensive.</p><p>"We're evaluating pricing not broadly, but specifically in context of each market and product line," Pemble explained. "There are cases where definitely, there's room to have different pricing, and there's other cases [where] it's more competitive and difficult to increase prices. So we're managing it case by case."</p><p>The Vivoactive 6, for instance, stayed affordable at $299, while the Fenix 8 was $200 more expensive. My guess is that Garmin will upcharge its premium-tier models because it already knows customers will pay above market rate, while the mainstream Venus and Forerunners stay low to compete with other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watch</a> brands.</p><p>It's also tried selling more budget "E" models like the Fenix E and Instinct E that cut major features, like an Apple Watch SE or Galaxy Watch FE. Selling <em>more</em> products, from premium to budget, is another way Big Tech brands are trying to combat tariffs.</p>

<p>Just this week, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/meta-q1-2025-earnings-show-major-ai-priority-shift-ray-ban-success">Meta warned shareholders</a> that tariffs could dip Asia-based ad sales up to billions of dollars, while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-q1-device-earnings-soar-its-chip-sales-take-a-hit">Samsung's Q1 earnings</a> explained how tariffs caused a "slowdown in growth" and will trigger declining smartphone demand.</p><p>Like Garmin, these Big Tech brands tried to assuage shareholders with their plans to counterbalance tariff effects. Samsung will "sustain profitability" with the upcoming Galaxy S25 Edge, while Meta will rely on Meta AI and Ray-Ban glasses to "offset" losses.</p><p>Basically, these companies plan to become more "efficient" and reprioritize their product categories to new, untapped areas. And the bigger the brand, the more tariff damage they'll have to mitigate.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">*APPLE ESTIMATES $900 MILLION IN COST INCREASES ON TARIFFS IN Q3<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1918055965867332069">May 1, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Garmin could easily focus on that second strategy. It already started this trend with Connect+; the next step is more LTE watches, based on a recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gadgetsandwearables.com/2025/04/29/garmin-fenix-8-lte/">Fenix 8 LTE leak</a>.</p><p>Some Garmin fans have begged for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whoop-40-review">Whoop-style band</a> for years, and while Garmin is unenthusiastic about smart rings, that could always change. Heck, Garmin could even revive its defunct Varia Vision lineup as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ar-running-glasses-arent-ready-yet-but-future-is-almost-here">fitness AR glasses</a>, another growing trend.</p><p>The point is, Garmin sells a hundred different products a year; what's a few more? It may decide to step outside its comfort zone and rush out new product categories it would have ignored in a pre-tariff world, simply to find new sources of revenue.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>To put things bluntly, last year sucked for the emulation community. Nintendo swept through and took away two of the best emulators that we've ever seen, leaving a massive void that has yet to be truly filled. However, it's usually not the massive corporations that are detrimental to the progression of emulators; it's the community.</p><p>Earlier this week, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/brunodev85/winlator">development of Winlator</a> was officially put on pause, following a barrage of harassment. The catalyst for it all was that after Winlator 10.0 was released, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EmulationOnAndroid/comments/1k95pzb/comment/mpu2vsr/?context=3">someone found</a> a Trojan that was raising flags in Windows Defender when the APK was downloaded to a computer.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1586px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="R3R7JmTbB2mUcP2AtqdeXN" name="winlator-development-notice-github" alt=""Development Paused" notice on the Winlator GitHub page" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/R3R7JmTbB2mUcP2AtqdeXN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1586" height="892" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Winlator/GitHub)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>After further inspection, it was the "TestD3D.exe" file, which was created and included by the developer as a way to offer benchmarking capabilities from within the container. This was later backed up, as people began running the APK through a variety of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.filescan.io/uploads/680e470446fe05453ca813f8/reports/ef1491ea-905f-4592-93c6-ccd0a295d3da/details">virus checkers</a>. It sure didn't take long for the news to spread like wildfire within the community, with many suggesting that brunodev85, the developer, was trying to cause harm.</p><p>From what I've been able to surmise, if you opened an application or game in the same container as one with the infected .exe, it too would become infected, wreaking havoc. However, the catch here is that all of that "havoc" would only be wreaked <em>within the container</em>. Similar issues would occur if you were to just create a different container, but that's it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="sBXQjbtuYN7q6yH3dLayiU" name="test-direct3d-app-winlator-z-fold-6" alt="Test Direct3D app in Winlator on Galaxy Z Fold 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sBXQjbtuYN7q6yH3dLayiU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The only way that this Trojan could cause actual problems is if you were to transfer infected files from your phone to your computer. This isn't something that many are likely to even consider, as it's usually just the other way around. But this also means that if you wanted to transfer a save file from your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">gaming handheld</a> to finish the game on your desktop PC, you'd probably end up not having a great day.</p><p>This is part of what makes Winlator special, as it's basically like running containerized virtual machines, but with the primary focus of being able to install and play PC games from an Android device. It's absolutely wild that this is something that our devices are capable of, even though there's <strong>a lot</strong> of trial and error that comes with getting games to work.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AfV2VzNryHJejxrcNJEpUX" name="multiple-emulators-on-s25-ultra-odin-2-pocket-dmg-z-fold-6" alt="Emulation on Android devices with the Galaxy S25 Ultra, AYANEO Pocket DMG, Galaxy Z Fold 6, and AYN Odin 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AfV2VzNryHJejxrcNJEpUX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Since Winlator burst onto the scene, we've seen a variety of "forks," or alternative iterations created, all while Bruno continued working on the "main branch." It's even reached the point that GameSir adopted Winlator as the backend for its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gamehub.xiaoji.com/"><em>GameHub</em> app</a>, which is essentially just a wrapper for Winlator, with a bunch of extra GameSir stuff thrown in.</p><p>As such, the developer made the project closed-source with the release of version 7.1, meaning that the entire codebase is no longer available for everyone to see. This is important, as the Trojan could have been spotted sooner, avoiding the entire situation.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1524px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="ekh2tAWBwdvxanYZwXewsF" name="winlator-false-positive-claims-github" alt="Winlator developer claims build throws a false positive flag before "completing" the GitHub issue" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ekh2tAWBwdvxanYZwXewsF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1524" height="858" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Winlator/GitHub)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At the same time, comments and questions have been previously brought up as to why Winlator would be flagged by antivirus software, only for the developer to claim it's a "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/brunodev85/winlator/issues/600">false positive</a>" or for the GitHub issue to be closed without any comment. So, to an extent, at least some of the backlash is warranted, but not to the extent that we saw.</p><p>I'm not here to debate whether Winlator should have remained open source or not, but what I do want to circle back to is the toxicity of the community. For one, this isn't the first time that we've seen a developer of a popular emulator leave the scene entirely. A similar situation happened with the popular PS2 emulator, AetherSX2.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="cRDAwt3DraZHw5TnohC4JP" name="PS2-emulation-hero.jpg" alt="EmulationStation for PS2 games on Android" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cRDAwt3DraZHw5TnohC4JP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That project closed up shop in early 2023, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidGaming/comments/13fm3yk/what_happened_to_aethersx2/" target="_blank">developer stating</a> that the reasons include "never-ending impersonating, complaints, demands, and now death threats." That situation came to a head after the AetherSX2 developer released an update that included an ad banner in the app. Previously, the developer was known for being staunchly against paid emulators, only to turn around and do the same thing.</p><p>However, when it comes to emulation, especially with higher-end consoles, people come out of the woodwork. Sometimes, a question gets asked and answered, and that's the end of it. But then, there are a few different scenarios that usually play out, no matter the emulator:</p>
<ul><li>Someone downloads the emulator and wants free ROMs or BIOS files.</li><li>People want to know why it can't run on lower-end hardware.</li><li>People want the developer to add a specific feature, despite it already being in the roadmap or confirmed that it won't be coming.</li><li>Impatience in the development process.</li></ul>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="5LG5X3EXaVBA8XZhPPZjbR" name="ps3-on-android-2" alt="Rayman on Pocket EVO and Gran Turismo via RPCS3 on Lenovo Legion Go S" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5LG5X3EXaVBA8XZhPPZjbR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unfortunately, often times when the developer(s) give a response that isn't favorable, that's when the backlash kicks in. And again, it's relentless to the point that some just stay away from emulation entirely, while others try to just enjoy what we have. If you need a good example as to why the community doesn't do itself any favors, just look at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://rpcs3.net/blog/2024/12/09/introducing-rpcs3-for-arm64/" target="_blank">announcement post</a> for when RPCS3 gained arm64 support.</p><p>"<em><strong>We have no intention of porting RPCS3 to these platforms at this time</strong></em><em>, so no discussion on these topics is needed. Unfortunately, this blanket decision is ultimately needed due to the high toxicity of several individuals in the Android community, who refuse to take no for an answer, some of which have already been banned from our communities.</em>"</p><p>At the time, it felt like a punch in the gut to the Android emulation scene, especially given what happened earlier in 2024 with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/nintendo-stikes-major-blow-android-emulators">Yuzu and Ryujinx</a>. This is just the reality of the space, where people want to do anything they can to cause problems if a developer (or team of devs) isn't giving them what they want.</p>

<p>Basically, the temper tantrum-like responses have just become meme fodder within the space. Everyone who pays attention knows what's going to happen whenever a major change is made or a brand-new emulator is released. Frankly, it's sad, as many of these emulators get started by just a single person, and are doing so out of love for the console, development, or whatever reasons they want.</p><p>Let me put it this way: there's enough hate, negativity, and vitriol in the rest of the world. It doesn't need to spread even further into our various hobbies and niches just because of an app or emulator.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/zimacube-nas-review">tested an early variant of the ZimaCube NAS</a> at the end of 2023, and while I noted at the time that it had plenty of potential, there were too many issues — both hardware and software — to recommend it widely. Thankfully, IceWhale (the brand behind ZimaCube) has been quite busy over the course of the last year, ironing out a lot of the initial issues and doing a better job with the software.</p><p>The result is that the ZimaCube Pro is a very different beast to the regular model I tested 15 months ago. The NAS has more powerful hardware, and it includes 10GbE connectivity in addition to the dual 2.5GbE ports. It is highly extensible, and there's even Thunderbolt 4. With the ability to slot 10 drives in total, the ZimaCube Pro handles heavy storage needs with relative ease.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="pHgHYoEvR4DeJXzDSECJKQ" name="ZimaCube Pro" alt="ZimaCube Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pHgHYoEvR4DeJXzDSECJKQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There hasn't been a better time to pick up a NAS system, with new entrants like UGREEN delivering exciting models with terrific hardware and the ability to run TrueNAS. While the ZimaCube Pro is on the costlier end of the scale, the caliber of the hardware makes it a great choice if you want a powerful home server to stream content anywhere.</p>
<p>IceWhale debuted the ZimaCube and ZimaCube at the end of 2023, and both models are now available globally. The ZimaCube Pro <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://shop.zimaspace.com/products/zimacube-pro-personal-cloud">costs $1,099 on the brand's website</a>, and you get a NAS that's powered by the 12th Gen Intel Core i5-1235U, 16GB of RAM, 256GB SSD installed as standard, Thunderbolt 4, 10 Gigabit Ethernet, and HDMI connectivity.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QyTY29LxmscNb8e2mSAT7Q" name="ZimaCube Pro" alt="ZimaCube Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QyTY29LxmscNb8e2mSAT7Q.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The standard ZimaCube is also available, and you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://shop.zimaspace.com/collections/zimacube-series/products/zimacube-personal-cloud">pick it up for $519 as of writing</a>. You don't get 10GbE connectivity, the NAS is powered by the N100 and 8GB of RAM, and you don't get as much bandwidth for the M/2 SSDs. Outside of that, it is identical to the Pro model, and if you want to save some cash, I'd suggest getting the regular variant.</p><p>The ZimaCube Pro looks identical to the standard model, so I'm not going to talk too much about the design. The metal construction is clearly built to last, and I didn't have any issues with the NAS after two months of testing. The regular ZimaCube is also going strong after 15 months of use, so the build quality isn't something that's worrisome.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="mERZUeQ9UkdxjYH5cz9nAQ" name="ZimaCube Pro" alt="ZimaCube Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mERZUeQ9UkdxjYH5cz9nAQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The NAS has a mesh door that's magnetically attached to the front, and the drive bays are housed behind it. It continues to be annoying to slot in drives as you don't get a tool-less design, but they're securely housed, and you get four M.2 slots in addition to the six regular drive bays. The extensibility gives the ZimaCube Pro an advantage, and you can add a total of ten drives in the NAS as standard.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="U4L9EK6iamRCngeYBSzFQQ" name="ZimaCube Pro" alt="ZimaCube Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U4L9EK6iamRCngeYBSzFQQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While I like the design, it doesn't have much in the way of ventilation. Most brands have vented sides that allow air inside the chassis, but that isn't the case on the ZimaCube Pro. Another downside is that the built-in fan is the loudest of any NAS I tested; even though IceWhale is using a new cooling solution, the fan gets loud even when the NAS isn't under loud, and it has an audible whine most of the time. Honestly, I'd suggest switching out the built-in fan if you're interested in this NAS.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="K3yCHoZLgeu4z58nHSgKVQ" name="ZimaCube Pro" alt="ZimaCube Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/K3yCHoZLgeu4z58nHSgKVQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Switching over to the hardware, the ZimaCube Pro uses a 12th Gen 10-core Intel Core i5-1235U, and it is terrific. It comes with 16GB of RAM installed — as two 8GB modules — and you even get a 256GB SSD. The real star of the show is the connectivity; with dual 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet ports and a 10 Gigabit port, the ZimaCube Pro is designed for multi-Gigabit networks.</p>
<p>There's also dual Thunderbolt 4 ports at the back alongside two USB-A and USB-C ports, and HDMI. Clearly, the main reason to pick up the ZimaCube Pro is the robust connectivity, and it wins out against its immediate rivals in this regard. That said, the software isn't quite as polished, and setting up the NAS is a bit convoluted.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QzTfF2Nr2X6pdHYxeykYEQ" name="ZimaCube Pro" alt="ZimaCube Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QzTfF2Nr2X6pdHYxeykYEQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I slotted in HDDs I tested on another NAS, and it just booted up that OS — which was just bizarre. ZimaOS doesn't include the ability to format drives while installing, so you'll need to manually erase data on HDDs before slotting them inside the NAS. It is annoying as every other NAS I tested until now has an option to erase data during initial configuration, and this is an oversight by IceWhale.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="T8k2TCggGdkjkc9D4ttDQQ" name="ZimaCube Pro" alt="ZimaCube Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/T8k2TCggGdkjkc9D4ttDQQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Zima OS software itself is usable; it gives you access to Docker containerization, a decent set of utilities in the store, and system monitoring dashboards. While it's gotten better over the last year and a half, it just doesn't have the same level of polish as other NAS brands. I didn't see any issues with moving data to and from the NAS, but you miss out on several extras that are standard on mainstream models, such as backing up photos and videos automatically.</p><p>However, you can easily install any OS of your choosing, and that in itself is a big allure — the best use case for the NAS is to set up an instance of TrueNAS Scale. If you don't mind tinkering to set up an alternative OS, the ZimaCube Pro is a great choice; it has one of the best overall hardware packages in this category. But if you need something that's ready to go out of the box, I'd suggest taking a look at the UGREEN DXP6800 Pro instead.</p>

That's particularly true when talking about something as genuinely cool as a folding phone, and Motorola's Razr line is the crème de la crème. However, that excitement typically doesn't last, especially not a year later when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025">the next iteration</a> is just about to debut.</p><p>To further complicate things, this isn't even her first folding phone. She started with the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3, then transitioned to a Galaxy Z Flip 4 in hopes of getting more than a half-day's battery per charge. Unfortunately, issues with battery life and screen durability persisted, so she turned to Motorola and its better-looking cover screen and hinge design.</p><p>Turns out, that was the right choice, and even though a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-series-hands-on">new wave of Razr phones</a> is about to launch, she's sitting pretty with her little green Razr Plus 2024 and couldn't be happier about it.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="gESYfYoXS2QaPatrbU5U2Y" name="motorola-razr-plus-2024-closed-cover-screen-01" alt="Holding a Motorola Razr Plus 2024 while it's closed with the cover screen illuminated and unlocked" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gESYfYoXS2QaPatrbU5U2Y.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Since she has been using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus 2024</a> for a year, it made sense for her thoughts to primarily drive this article, so I sat down with her the other night and asked if she could make a checklist of pros and cons for the phone.</p><p>"Pros: Compact size for purse or pocket, yet full-size phone when unfolded.  Quick use of the front screen without needing to be flipped open. Feels satisfying and fully disengaged when snapped closed.  I love the color and texture."</p><p>"Cons: I can't think of any."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="7zbKSLXR52WREAiNvwEai8" name="motorola-razr-plus-2024-open-home-screen" alt="The Motorola Razr Plus 2024 open with its home screen showing, on a tea tray next to some roses and tea pots" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7zbKSLXR52WREAiNvwEai8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What's impressive here is that she had a pretty notable list of problems with her previous Samsung Galaxy Z Flip phones before, yet after a year of using the Motorola Razr Plus 2024, she couldn't think of anything negative worth mentioning.</p><p>I recalled a few times when she noted that she "couldn't zoom out" when taking a photo, referencing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025-needs-to-ditch-telephoto-camera">the lack of an ultrawide camera</a> in the Razr Plus 2024. When I reminded her of this, she shrugged it off and didn't think it was actually that big of a deal in the end. A "minor inconvenience," as she put it.</p><p>In fact, the camera has been one of the highlights of the phone, in my recollection, despite her not mentioning it on the list of positives above. One distinct moment I can remember was back in October when we went to a water park with family in Florida. We had just finished the day and were on the way back to the car via the park's shuttle system, and my wife was taking photos of everyone's tired, wet faces.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kmxA8vznEPkq9pPkTqSiFo" name="motorola-razr-plus-2024-closed-camera-viewfinder-01" alt="Taking a picture of me taking a picture of the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 with its cover screen camera viewfinder active" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kmxA8vznEPkq9pPkTqSiFo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As she was about to snap a photo of her sister, brother-in-law, and their kids, her sister gawked at the phone right as my wife took the photo. The result is the raw amazement of seeing yourself on the front of a foldable phone as the photo is being taken, one of the many helpful tools the Razr has for folks who love taking pictures.</p><p>My colleague, Derrek Lee, can also attest to this being the usual reaction he gets when taking photos of people with the Razr.</p><p>And while the ultrawide lens is certainly missed, I think adding a bit of zoom detail versus having the ultrawide lens was the right choice in the end. I know Derrek doesn't agree with me on this point, but it seems that Motorola's user surveys agree with me, as indicated by the Razr Plus 2025's cameras.</p>
<h2 id="size-is-key-2">Size is key</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="HKWDkAoGdAKV5WWfemRYBh" name="motorola-razr-plus-2024-closed-green-03" alt="The back of the green Motorola Razr Plus 2024 while it's closed, sitting on a tea tray next to some roses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HKWDkAoGdAKV5WWfemRYBh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Whenever my wife and I meet someone who has never seen the Razr, they always ask her if she likes it and what her favorite thing about it is. The answer to the second question is always the size. "I can fold it up and fit it in a pocket or even a small purse, something that I haven't been able to do with phones for a long time."</p><p>I feel like people always talk about how much they hate modern phone sizes and they wish things were smaller, but the only way to do that is to compromise on components, and no one wants that in the end.</p><p>Flip phones allow companies to cram in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-vs-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6">basically everything you want</a> into a phone that's both large enough to accommodate components like great cameras and big batteries, enough screen space to be enjoyable to use, yet also be small enough to fit in a tight jean pocket.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="oQ9D9eG2S7v9atQLmYRd8D" name="motorola-razr-plus-2024-open-browsing" alt="Doing some sock shopping on the Motorola Razr Plus 2024's large inner display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oQ9D9eG2S7v9atQLmYRd8D.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's also no denying the usefulness of the cover screen. Unlike Samsung, Motorola's cover screen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/24-hours-using-only-the-motorola-razr-and-galaxy-z-flip-cover-screens">is largely unrestricted</a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/24-hours-using-only-the-motorola-razr-and-galaxy-z-flip-cover-screens" target="_blank">,</a> allowing you to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-set-up-use-motorola-razr-cover-screen-apps" target="_blank">run full apps</a> without needing to adjust settings or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-set-up-and-use-apps-on-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-cover-screen" target="_blank">download a separate</a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-set-up-and-use-apps-on-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-cover-screen"> app</a>. I see her on her cover screen all the time, and the fact that she told me without prompting only further emphasizes how useful it is.</p><p>Motorola also really nailed the hinge and the display in a way Samsung has struggled to over the years. I don't have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> to directly compare it to right now, but we had to replace the screen protector on both her Z Flip 3 and Z Flip 4 every 3-4 months as it would inevitably start lifting off the display right at the hinge. One of her phones cracked right at this line, and I blamed the cracked screen protector for it.</p><p>This has yet to happen on the Motorola Razr Plus 2024. Motorola's display folds differently from Samsung's previous models, and it clearly works better for both the display <em>and</em> the preinstalled screen protector.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Unlike with her previous two Samsung Galaxy Z Flip phones, the Motorola Razr Plus 2024's display didn't show signs of wear and tear after a few months.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>When I asked her if she's ever noticed any peeling or bubbling, the immediate response was "Nope!" She also added that she doesn't "really notice a bump in the folding part of the screen either," once again alluding to Motorola's superior screen and hinge design for this product.</p><p>Additionally, she can show me videos and posts on her phone, unlike when she used the Galaxy Z Flip 4, which has a terrible <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a> rate and hurts my eyes to look at. Motorola lets you disable PWM dimming entirely, making it a great foldable choice for sensitive eyes.</p><p>I was also pleasantly surprised by how easy it was to find a good case and MagSafe adapter for the phone. She's been using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/RMOCR-Moto-Razr-Plus-2024/dp/B0D4DXWTRZ/">this $9 clear case</a> paired with the OhSnap Snap 4 Luxe Mag Safe grip ring (find it at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/ohsnap-snap-4-luxe-magnetic-phone-grip-stand-ultra-thin-fits-any-phone-supports-magsafe-charging-rose-pink/6576262.p?skuId=6576262">Best Buy</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ohsnap.com/products/snap-grip">OhSnap's website</a>) and hasn't felt the need to change it. It adds very little bulk to the phone, and the addition of the OhSnap ring gives us the ability to use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/iottie-qi2-car-vent-mount">this excellent Qi2 car charger</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="C9JWqT3NRgE6xTfBCc45cH" name="motorola-razr-plus-2024-clear-case-with-ohsnap-magsafe-ring" alt="A clear case for the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 with an OhSnap Snap 4 Luxe MagSafe ring attached" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C9JWqT3NRgE6xTfBCc45cH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Lastly, I also noticed that she didn't mention battery life at all, which is a <strong>massive</strong> change coming from the Z Flip 3/4. Both of those phones had downright terrible battery life, and while the Flip 4 improved things, she regularly had to charge both models before the day was over.</p><p>That's not a problem for the Razr Plus 2024, which ranked in the top 10 for best battery life <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/motorola-razr-plus-2024-battery-and-charging_id159756">from Phone Arena</a> last year. Despite having a more "power-efficient" Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 — that's marketing speak for less powerful — I can't recall a time she's ever complained about the phone being slow or laggy.</p><p>While I fully expected the Razr to be a good choice after all the praise it got at launch, this phone more than exceeded even my wildest expectations as a replacement for Samsung's Z Flip series. Motorola more than won my wife over here, and her experience has only further proven to me that the company makes the best foldable phones you can buy today.</p>

<ul><li>Google is rolling out built-in AI image editing in Gemini, so you can tweak both AI-generated and your own photos directly in the app.</li><li>You can now swap backgrounds, add or remove objects, and blend photos with AI magic right in Gemini.</li><li>The upgrade combines text and visuals, so you can tell Gemini a story and get both the words and images to match.</li></ul>

<p>Google’s built-in AI image editor for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> now lets you tweak both your own photos and AI-made ones right in the app.</p><p>Starting today, Google is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/image-editing/" target="_blank">rolling out</a> built-in AI editing tools in the Gemini app. This means you can soon swap backgrounds, add or remove objects, and blend your photos with AI magic.</p><p>This editing feature isn’t just for AI-generated images. Gemini also lets you tweak your own photos uploaded from your phone or computer.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.31%;"><img id="UxAQdiDLdwhuqQHaRVxbyV" name="Gemini-image-editor" alt="image editor in Google Gemini app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UxAQdiDLdwhuqQHaRVxbyV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="901" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You can keep fine-tuning your edits just by telling Gemini what you want, and each change stays in sync with the overall look. It's a big step up for Gemini, moving from just chatting to handling detailed image edits too.</p><p>Gemini uses a step-by-step editing flow, giving what Google calls richer, more context-aware results by blending text and visuals as you go.</p>
<h2 id="story-mode-activated-2">Story mode activated</h2>
<p>This upgrade also taps into Gemini’s multimodal powers, letting you mix words and visuals in one go. Say you ask it for a nighttime dragon story—it won’t just write it, it’ll throw in custom visuals to bring it to life.</p><p>Google says Gemini’s built-in image editing is rolling out gradually and should hit over 45 languages and most countries in the coming weeks.</p><p>Any image edited in Gemini will quietly get a SynthID digital watermark, a hidden tag from Google that flags AI-made content. Google is also thinking about stamping all images made by Gemini with it, not just the edited ones.</p><p>This new rollout follows Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-used-the-gemini-api-and-ai-studio-to-make-the-i-o-2025-puzzle">earlier AI image editing test</a> in AI Studio back in March, which grabbed headlines mainly because it could remove watermarks from any image, raising quite a few eyebrows.</p><p>The warm reception to that first release has cleared the path for what's next, and those powerful editing tools are now making their way directly into the Gemini app.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung has reportedly settled on using its own Exynos 2500 system-on-a-chip for the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a>, per a report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.chosun.com/english/companies-en/2025/04/30/B4NIBOIHQRDOVBIS3QO4PELV7Y/" target="_blank">The Chosun Daily</a>. Industry experts tell the publication that despite estimated yield rates of between 20% and 40% for the Exynos 2500, it will power the Galaxy Z Flip 7. Meanwhile, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> is still expected to feature a Snapdragon processor.</p><p>Reportedly-low yield rates for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-fe-exynos-2500-impact-rumors">Samsung's Exynos 2500</a> and alleged price hikes for Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon chip put the Galaxy Z Flip 7's processor up in the air. Now, it seems like the South Korean tech giant will in fact move to an Exynos chips for its next flagship clamshell foldable. This comes after Samsung was believed to have been testing Galaxy Z Flip 7 units with Snapdragon chipsets internally as recently as last month.</p><p>"It appears the company has determined that yield has stabilized to a workable level," an anonymous industry official told The Chosun Daily. "The relatively smaller shipment volumes of foldable phones, compared to the Galaxy S series, also made it easier to opt for Exynos."</p>

<p>Samsung Foundry's struggle to fabricate chips reliably and efficiently has forced its flagship products to rely on MediaTek and Qualcomm processing of late.

<ul><li>Galaxy S25 Edge leaks in all angles, colorways, leaving nothing to the imagination.</li><li>The leak gives in-depth insights into the alleged specs of the device, along with pricing.</li><li>The device is said to weigh just 163 grams, and show up in Titanium Jet Black, Titanium Icy Blue, and Titanium Silver.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A German tech <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,150666.html">website</a> is leaving no stone unturned when it comes to the most recent Galaxy S25 Edge leak. In an exclusive post, the publication seems to have got its hands on alleged hardware and software information of the upcoming Galaxy S25 Edge. It also shows off the phone, in all the alleged colorways, and all angles with official-looking renders of the device.</p><p>We've been privy to many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/new-leak-shows-off-samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-in-titanium-variants">leaks</a> that gave us similar information about the phone until now, including the latest one that talks about how the phone <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-tipped-for-may-debut-new-leak-claims">is set to launch</a> on May 13. However, this post gives us in-depth information from the dimensions of the device, to whether or not it will come with Qi2 support.</p><p>To start,  the publication doubles down on the rumor about its launch set for May 13. And it goes on to say the device will be 5.85 millimeters thick. And much like the Galaxy S25 Ultra, it would be made of titanium with glass covers on the front and back. These glass covers will be protected by Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2, and an all-new Corning Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2, much like the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-series-hands-on">Motorola Razr 2025 series.</a></p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1354px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:51.85%;"><img id="k89SYrkM5ieK5Mkgqoq7ND" name="Galaxy-S25-Edge-renders-leak" alt="Renders of the alleged Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/k89SYrkM5ieK5Mkgqoq7ND.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1354" height="702" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WinFuture)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As for the display, the Galaxy S25 Edge will allegedly have a 6.7-inch AMOLED panel with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 pixels and a dynamic refresh rate of 120 Hz. The display is said to have an ultrasound-based fingerprint reader under it.</p><p>At the phone's core is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://winfuture.de/special/qualcomm/">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> for Galaxy, just like the other variants in the lineup. It features 12 GB of RAM and 256 or 512 GB of internal flash storage, the publication adds.</p><p>While we were aware that the phone would get two rear cameras and a selfie camera, the leak purports that it uses a single 200-megapixel sensor for the main camera and a  12 MP ultra-wide lens with a 120-degree field of view. The front camera comes with a 12 MP lens. Winfuture notes that only the main camera features optical image stabilization.</p><p>Much like the other phones in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-launch">Galaxy S25 series</a>, this fourth variant is also said to get an IP68 dust and water resistance certification. Additional features include support for wireless charging, Bluetooth 5.4, and Wi-Fi 7.</p>

<p>However, the battery woes for this device continue as it is expected to show up with a smaller 3,900 mAh capacity. On the software front, it is said to get Android 15 and One UI 7 out of the box.</p><p>Lastly, the publication adds that this premium phone would come with a hefty €1,249 pricetag.

<ul><li>Google said it will be opening up AI Mode to anyone using Labs in the U.S., and ditching its waitlist for it.</li><li>It is introducing actionable tools along with a Gemini-like feature that will give you a history of your search results.</li><li>The tech giant said it will be testing out AI Mode with a small percentage of U.S. folks outside of labs.</li><li>These features will be rolled out to anyone using AI Mode on Labs in the coming weeks.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/search/ai-mode-updates-may-2025/">announced</a> today (May 1) that it will be opening up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-tests-experimental-ai-mode">AI Mode </a>to anyone using Labs in the U.S. and will discontinue its waitlist. It will also make things easier for people to interact with AI Mode. In the coming weeks, the company will be adding the ability to tap for more details in search results within AI Mode.</p><p>Users will also be able to view places and product blocks for local spots, such as restaurants, salons, and stores. With these blocks, those using AI Mode can see information like ratings, reviews, and opening hours for a specific place at a glance.</p><p>And the Search query was shopping-centric and something to do with a specific product, users will see options with real-time prices (including the latest promotions), images, shipping details, and local inventory, all on AI Mode.</p><p>For instance, if you're setting out on a camping trip, you can ask AI Mode for the "best foldable camping chair that would fit in a backpack for under $100," as opposed to just asking " show me a foldable camping chair" on Google Search. These search queries can be more personalized to your situation.</p><p>"AI Mode will give you a comprehensive breakdown of recommended products that fit your budget, along with product details and links to retailers," the Keyword stated.</p>
<div class="instagram-embed"><blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version="6" style="width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);"><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DJHhRQzMLWD/" target="_blank">A post shared by Google (@google)</a></p><p>A photo posted by  on </p></blockquote></div>
<p>Next up, Google is adding a feature common to streaming platforms — picking up where you left off. This is specifically handy when you have to step away from your device because something else has come up. Or when you want to return to a more specific search query and retrieve some additional information from it.</p><p>When users click the new left-side panel to access their past searches, each topic will include the information that AI Mode has already found for them, just like the chat history panel on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-geminihttps://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a>.</p><p>Lastly, Google brings some good news to users outside of its Labs. The tech giant said it will be rolling out AI Mode to a small percentage of people in the U.S. who will see the AI Mode tab in Search. This could mean that Google plans on a larger rollout of this feature in the weeks to come.</p>

<hr>
<p>Personal and Business users on Google are picking up a huge update that revamps its calling experience and more.</p><p>Earlier today (May 1), Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/05/google-voice-three-way-call-support-and-updated-user-interface.html">Workspace blog</a> posted the patch notes for an update that's rolling out for the Voice app. The notes highlight two major changes: three-way calling support and a reworked calling interface. Three-way calling support begins with you (the host). Google states users can begin a call with one person, and its newly reworked UI will display its "Add" and "Merge" options in a more prominent space.</p><p>The "Add" button is placed in the top row of options, alongside Transfer and Hold, when in a call. Tapping this sends you to a list of "Suggested" contacts, while also giving you the chance to search for someone you're looking for. Adding a third person will place their call on hold at the top of your call screen.</p><p>However, the "Add" button morphs into "Merge" after doing this. Google Voice will combine all parties into a "Conference call" where everyone can speak together.</p><p>Many of these elements, such as the call on hold notification at the top, as well as the other previously mentioned tools, have been moved to more noticeable placements. Google says this should make the tools for managing your calls more "easily accessible."</p>

<p>While the update for Google Voice involves three-way calling support <em>and </em>the UI rework, the post says everything won't drop everywhere. According to the post, three-way calling is arriving for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/google-workspace">Google Workspace</a> customers with a Voice Starter, Voice Standard, Voice Premier subscription. It will also rollout for SIP Link Standard and SIP Link Premier customers.</p><p>The UI updates will soon arrive for all Google Voice users. The update has started today (May 1) and is expected to complete in roughly 15 days.</p><p>Google Voice hasn't had a ton going on; however, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/its-now-easier-to-delegate-google-voice-calls-and-transfer-your-number">another notable update</a> came in February. The update brought a new feature to the app called "call delegation." The feature works like a corporate phone line. Users on a call can tap "Transfer" to send that line to another person. Users can either transfer it right away or hit "Ask First," which likely seeks out confirmation from the other person.</p><p>While that was a "highly-requested" feature, Voice's February update also included the ability to transfer calls from a personal account to a paid enterprise account.</p>

<p>Gemini's takeover across Google's ecosystem continues as a new report claims it's starting to hit smartwatches.</p><p>Evidence of Gemini slowly encroaching on the Assistant's space in Wear OS was highlighted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/first-signs-of-gemini-landing-on-wear-os/">Android Police</a>. The post cites a tipster's report that when launching the AI assistant on their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-review">Galaxy Watch 4</a>, Gemini's logo is there to greet them before the app fully opens.</p><p>The changes are happening very slowly as, aside from Gemini's starry-diamond logo, it's still yet to make a proper appearance.</p><p>After the app opens, the Assistant is still utilized in full force by Wear OS. Its logo is present at the top and the AI's classic multi-colored scheme is still present at the bottom. The publication adds that it also spotted the small Gemini cameo on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-vs-watch-2">OnePlus Watch 2</a>, indicating Google is likely beginning to spread its model to wearables more prominently.</p><p>Lastly, the post reiterates Wear OS v1.18, which changed "Assistant" to "Digital Assistant" in the full app list. The app in the Wear OS list also displays the Gemini logo; however, as the publication suspects, the name is most likely just a placeholder.</p>

<p>We've been expecting Gemini to make its formal appearance on Wear OS since January, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-may-soon-get-gemini">when an APK teardown</a> surfaced Google's plans. Its early code said users would be able to “easily talk back and forth to get more done with an assistant on your watch." Of course, this is backed by "reimagined Google AI," which is just code for Gemini.</p><p>In March, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-on-wear-os-sounds-an-awful-lot-like-google-assistant">Google confirmed Gemini</a> was headed to Wear OS, but more information, most recently, shows it's more than just a rebrand. Code from v1.18 of Google APKs suggested that the entire app on Wear OS would get a total upgrade. It also showed that users will surface the AI by saying "Hey Google," reminiscent of the old Assistant. Other important bits of information, like whether or not Wear OS' Gemini will interact with its extensions, remain to be seen.</p><p>It's a hope of ours, but not confirmed.</p><p>Keep in mind that Google recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-gemini-io-2025-newsletter-teasers">teased "new possibilities" coming</a> for Gemini during its I/O 2025 event in May. Its teaser didn't go in-depth; however, there's a chance we might see tidbits about the AI in Wear OS and other places.</p>

<p>The Galaxy S25 Ultra may be powerful and loaded with all of the latest AI capabilities, but it's also pretty expensive, which is why this 18% discount from Amazon is such a welcome sight. That's the largest discount that the 256GB smartphone has ever received from the retailer, plus up to $785 (in the form of an Amazon gift card) is up for grabs if you want to process a trade-in. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DP3GQ4QY" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="24ac777c-c365-469a-b289-de3240c9f30c" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra 256GB: $1,299.99" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra 256GB: $1,299.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>Senior editor Andrew Myrick called the Galaxy S25 Ultra "so close to perfection" in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">his 4.5/5-star review</a>, and it isn&apos;t hard to see why. Straight out of the box, you&apos;re getting a gorgeous 6.9-inch slab with a 120Hz AMOLED display and S Pen stylus embedded directly into the device, while under the hood you&apos;ll enjoy the powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, 12GB of RAM, and all of the latest Galaxy AI and Gemini-powered software features. The battery life is also excellent, while the S25 Ultra&apos;s upgraded ultrawide camera easily rivals the performance of the latest Pixel phones. And of course, like the rest of the S25 series, you&apos;ll also be guaranteed to receive seven years of OS and security upgrades.</p><p>We&apos;ve seen plenty of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-deals-of-the-month">Galaxy S25 deals</a> over the past few months, but it&apos;s nice to see a promo that doesn&apos;t require a trade-in or major change to your wireless service. Naturally, spending $1,000 on a smartphone is still a hard sell for many folks, so consider looking at the base model <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-review">S25 Plus</a> if this Ultra deal isn&apos;t working for you.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google is in the process of rolling out a few tools that gives Gemini users quicker access to their favorite features.</p><p>In a press release, Google states the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini app</a> on Android and iOS is beginning to receive an update that brings home screen widgets. The company states these widgets enable users to invoke "key actions" without needing to dive into the full app. On Android, the post states users can soon tap and hold their home screen and tap "Widgets" to find the Gemini app's new selection.</p><p>Google says Android users will find widgets that'll help them easily access their camera, file/image sharing, and more. Moreover, the post adds that a standout aspect of these new widgets is the ability for users to initiate "new chats with Gemini directly from the home screen widget."</p><p>After choosing, users can customize/resize these new widgets on their phones or remove them by tossing them into the "Remove" option at the top.</p><p>These widgets started rolling out on April 30 for devices with Android 10 and higher.</p>
<h2 id="gemini-app-development-continues-2">Gemini app Development Continues</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="FFvZEBujRzeeVAA4ZSMsMf" name="google-gemini-mwc-sign.jpg" alt="Google Gemini on Android at MWC 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FFvZEBujRzeeVAA4ZSMsMf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Users on iOS can tap and hold their home screen and tap "Edit" to find their widgets. Additionally, Google says iPhone users can "customize the actions on widgets" by "long pressing on widgets and select actions in the menu." The update has also started rolling out on iPhones with iOS 17 and up. Google states smartphones will see a gradual rollout; however, it should be mostly complete by "early next week."</p><p>You may remember <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-on-iphones-slight-rework-lock-screen-apple-update">an update for iOS devices</a> in March that brought Gemini's widgets to its lock screen. The tools provided include Type Prompt, Talk Live, Open Mic, Use Camera, Share Image, and Share File.

<p>Walkabout Mini Golf is one of the best Meta Quest games ever made, and it's also the 20th best-selling Meta Quest game. This success has allowed the developers at Mighty Coconut to support it for years, regularly cranking out new courses and features for gamers to play around with.</p><p>Today's release of the latest course, Raptor Cliff's, marks the culmination of a trio of Walkabout-related announcements, making April 2025 an extra special month for the game. Before that, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mightycoconut.com/updates/priceupdate2025">Mighty Coconut announced</a> it would fold six previous DLC courses into the main game, with a nominal $5 price increase, nearly doubling the number of base courses. That's $5 <em>total</em> for what used to cost players $4 per course, and existing players are getting that <strong>for free</strong>.</p><p>To round out the festivities, Mighty Coconut partnered with FormX Design to debut the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://formx.design/products/griptoputter3">Grip-to-Putter 3</a>, the third generation of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/helloreal-quest-golf-putter">my favorite VR golfing accessory</a>. All of this adds up to a splendid month for the best mini golf game you'll ever play, and all you'll need is a Meta Quest headset <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/walkabout-mini-golf/id1531384971">or an iPhone</a> to enjoy it.</p>

<h2 id="the-meaning-behind-the-apostrophe-2">The meaning behind the apostrophe</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:50.00%;"><img id="grUCeC8kkgsgoakE4r5sZB" name="walkabout-mini-golf-raptor-cliffs-screenshot-01" alt="A screenshot of the Raptor Cliff's course in Walkabout Mini Golf taken from a Meta Quest 3 showing Raptor Cliff's portrait in the gift shop" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/grUCeC8kkgsgoakE4r5sZB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1024" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You probably saw "Raptor Cliff's" and wondered if it was a spelling mistake. I thought the same thing until I walked through the new course with Walkabout's senior art director, Don Carson, and one of the level designers, Henning Koczy. As it turns out, there's a very specific reason the apostrophe is in the name.</p><p>The reason has a name, and his name is Raptor Cliff. He's the mascot for the roadside golf course attraction featured in the latest Walkabout Mini Golf DLC, and you can find his picture behind the gift shop, right at the entrance to the course (pictured above). Carson told me the course was designed specifically to evoke the feeling of the roadside attractions along the Northwestern American coast in the 1970s, which he used to visit with his grandparents when he was a kid.</p><p>"There's no anachronism in the gift shop" that makes its theme inherently obvious, but you might draw from the cars on the road that the course doesn't look like this in 2025. As a roadside attraction, the team wanted to emphasize that "this isn't Jurassic Park" and that the dinosaurs think you are friends, not food.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8zihnyWGYY7RDTh7oyWRZB" name="walkabout-mini-golf-raptor-cliffs-screenshot-06" alt="A screenshot of the Raptor Cliff's course in Walkabout Mini Golf taken from a Meta Quest 3 showing the hole where you have to hit the ball in the brontosaurus's mouth" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8zihnyWGYY7RDTh7oyWRZB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That all starts right at the beginning of the course as you putt your way through the middle of a giant redwood tree, only to be greeted by a giant red T-Rex with its tongue hanging out like a dog. Watch him long enough and you'll see his belly shake as he scratches himself while watching you golf.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>"All our dinosaurs are so very well fed that they're just like big dogs," Carson told me, which helps allude to the idea that this is not Jurassic Park.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>"All our dinosaurs are so very well fed that they're just like big dogs," Carson told me, which alludes to the idea that these aren't scary man-eating lizards like you see in the movies. Several holes feature dinosaurs more prominently, like one where you roll the ball up a Stegosaurus's back, or another hole where you hit the ball into a Brontosaurus's mouth and then have to putt between its legs on the next hole below.</p><p>There's even a Triceratops that lets you sit on its back, plus a new zipline mechanic, cars you can ride on (that actually move around the island), and several new mechanics found throughout the course. In one section, I noticed that you had to bounce a ball off a sign to make it to the next part of the hole, and I asked the team how often they build for scenarios that can't be done in real life.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fwPgwSAv6eHMAY6ctHaFZB" name="walkabout-mini-golf-raptor-cliffs-screenshot-05" alt="A screenshot of the Raptor Cliff's course in Walkabout Mini Golf taken from a Meta Quest 3 showing a camping van by the coast alongside a ridable triceratops and a dinosaur in the ocean" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fwPgwSAv6eHMAY6ctHaFZB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>"A normal golf course wouldn't really do this. I kind of forget how tame a realistic golf course has to be. You can't get the ball off the ground for fear of hitting another patron in the head. So this unpredictable bounce off the sign is probably not going to happen in real life." It's one of the many reasons I love mini golf in VR, and it's just the start of what makes this course so special.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>A normal golf course wouldn't really do this. I kind of forget how tame a realistic golf course has to be.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>As I was admiring all the little details found in the second caddy shop on the course, Carson told me to keep an eye out for little stories hidden along the way as I progressed through the course. "Emma Mercado, who does all the avatar accessories and avatar heads, also she does a lot of our set decoration, and she imbues so much of the environment with little bits of story."</p><p>Behind the counter in the gift shop at the beginning of the course, you can find a pair of dinosaur slippers and a half-eaten container of fudge that an employee obviously broke into. But the real fun tidbit to learn was that Emma has an almost obsessive interest in placing "jilted love affairs" scattered throughout several courses.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uXnuzpTX5xxbshiVhDgFaB" name="walkabout-mini-golf-raptor-cliffs-screenshot-04" alt="A screenshot of the Raptor Cliff's course in Walkabout Mini Golf taken from a Meta Quest 3 showing the roadside fudge stand and an old station wagon" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uXnuzpTX5xxbshiVhDgFaB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>"There was always some vignette somewhere where someone had broken up with someone else. You could tell by the arrangement of props," Carson told me.</p><p>"My favorite being up in the rooftops of Venice. Someone had obviously whipped out an engagement ring and you see the wine's been knocked over and the flowers have been thrown off the roof and are leaning up against the chimney."</p>
<p>It all fits so well together in the theme of each course, which Carson told me was specifically planned out to offer something for everyone throughout the year. Course size and complexity are additional considerations made by the team, and while Koczy told me that holes are normally designed to be between 60 and 80 square meters, larger courses like Mount Olympus require a bit more space.</p><p>But Raptor Cliff's was designed to feel cozy and warm, "like a trip to summer camp," as Carson put it. The warm glow of the sun and the simple joy of a roadside tourist attraction provide a wonderful break for your cramped legs and bored brain, something that, ironically, fits quite well in our modern-day-to-day, where so many of us sit on our rear ends for hours at a time.</p>

<p>While I've named the YOGES Adjustable Length club the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-meta-quest-3-accessories#section-quest-3-3s-accessories-you-might-also-want">best Quest 3 accessory</a> for VR golfers for quite some time, FormX's new Grip-to-Putter 3 just took its place as the new best. The previous Grip-to-Putter 2 design didn't work very well for the Quest 3 because the controller is tracked differently than the Quest 2, so FormX went back to the drawing board for the third generation.</p><p>While it doesn't feature the adjustable length feature of the YOGES club, it does offer a more useful feature for Walkabout Mini Golf: a physical grip-to-putt handle. See, Walkabout has this clever in-game feature called grip-to-putt, which makes your club transparent until you hold down the grip button on your controller.</p><p>This mechanic allows you to practice your swings without fear of hitting the ball until you're ready, but it's not possible to use with a normal golf club controller attachment since you can't reach the grip button while holding the club handle. The Grip-to-Putter 3 has a little trigger on the handle that you press and hold to activate grip-to-putt functionality, and it works as well as you would hope.</p>

<p>And that's not the only thing that's really great here. Most golf club attachments are a bit of a pain to get set up, as you typically have to slide the wrist strap through a tiny hole and wrap it around the handle to keep the controller from flying away. With Grip-to-Putter 3, you just slide the controller into a chamber and lock it in with a little green sliding mechanism. No wrist strap, no custom battery door, no hassle at all.</p><p>The one negative thing I found with the design is that when inserting the controller, sometimes it's easy to push it too far into the chamber. This causes the grip button to be held down, negating the grip-to-putt functionality. It's an easy enough fix — just pull the controller up a bit until it clicks — but I played through more than half the course before realizing grip-to-putt wasn't broken because of a game bug, rather because of the physical controller's positioning.</p><p>However, this only happened once, and now that I'm aware of it, it won't happen again. I love using clubs like this because they add real weight and club physics to your virtual club, which ends up translating into better scores in my experience. If you're looking for the ultimate Walkabout Mini Golf club attachment for your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Meta Quest 3</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-review">Quest 3S</a>, this is the one to get.</p>

<ul><li>A Weibo tipster claims REDMAGIC is developing a new gaming tablet, which could launch in May "at the earliest" or June "at the latest."</li><li>The tipster suggests the tablet will offer a slightly smaller 9 inch OLED display with the Snapdragon 8 Elite.</li><li>REDMAGIC launched the Nova gaming tablet last September with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, a 10,100mAh battery, and a 10.9-inch display.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>If you're looking for a new gaming tablet, you might be spoiled for choice as rumors heat up about a new challenger.</p><p>These rumors branch off a post from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5161097771352748">Digital Chat Station</a> (DCS) on Weibo, claiming this new gaming tablet could come from REDMAGIC's kitchen (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/05/01/android-gaming-tablet-9-inch-oled-display-redmagic/">9to5Google</a>). The tipster claims the OEM could opt for an OLED screen instead of the LCD provided on its tablet from late 2024. Moreover, there's speculation that REDMAGIC's next gaming tablet screen could be "custom" with a "high-refresh" rate at 9 inches.</p><p>DCS purports the company could grab Qualcomm's latest flagship SoC, the Snapdragon 8 Elite, for its 2025 gaming addition.</p><p>The comments hold more, with the tipster replying to user interest and claiming this device could launch "May at the earliest, June at the latest."</p>

<p>While some of the more "exciting" specs weren't speculated, we have REDMAGIC's latest release, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/nubias-new-gaming-tablet-crushes-the-competition-with-a-premium-chipset-and-built-in-fan">the Nova</a>, to compare the rumors to. The tablet launched with a slightly larger screen — 10.9 inches — than what we're seeing rumored currently. It took things further with 2K resolution and a 144Hz refresh rate. Internally, REDMAGIC packed the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 SoC, a 20,000 RPM fan, and many more thermal gymnastics within it to keep the tablet cool for longer gaming sessions.</p><p>Powering it is a 10,100mAh battery. It remains to be seen just how far REDMAGIC will push these key areas when this new version arrives (if it's to be expected). Another key takeaway is its launch, which was in early September 2024. The company quickly turned around with an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/redmagic-nova-gaming-tablet-international-launch-details">international launch announcement</a> a couple of weeks later.</p><p>With the tipster's "May at the earliest, June at the latest" assumption, the initial debut would concern China, leaving global consumers (potentially) waiting for a global rollout shortly after. This is all pure speculation, so keep your eyes peeled for more official information.</p><p>In other news, Lenovo teased a gaming addition of its own: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/lenovo/lenovo-legion-tab-fourth-gen-social-media-teasers">the Legion Tab Gen 4</a>. Perhaps there's some competition brewing as these two devices could launch around similar times.</p>

Doing so gives these drives the ability to transfer content at 1,000MB/s — 10 times higher than normal drives. I used <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/storage/teamgroup-x1-max-most-versatile-ssd-ever">Teamgroup's X1 Max</a> over the last six months, and it transformed how easy it is to access large amounts of data on the go.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="4bpdogFgFnDcxsEwPZmRLC" name="Seagate Ultra Compact SSD" alt="Seagate's Ultra Compact SSD against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4bpdogFgFnDcxsEwPZmRLC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Seagate is now getting in on the action with the Ultra Compact SSD; as you can guess by the name, the SSD is designed to be portable, and it looks just like a regular flash drive — albeit a little taller than usual. It is available with 1TB of storage <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Ultra-Compact-External-Solid-State/dp/B0DJ9J4BNG">for just $84</a>, and I'm using the 2TB model, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Ultra-Compact-External-Solid-State/dp/B0DJ9K1QSY">comes in at $149</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="zgLxjVAwngk7tYBvehmxMC" name="Seagate Ultra Compact SSD" alt="Seagate's Ultra Compact SSD against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zgLxjVAwngk7tYBvehmxMC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The SSD is considerably smaller than most regular external SSDs like Samsung's T7 and Crucial X10 Pro, and the cable-free design makes it easy to use anywhere. The drive connects through USB-C, and I didn't have any issues using it with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-is-the-most-exciting-phone-around">Huawei Mate XT</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/oppo-find-x8-ultra-review">Find X8 Ultra</a>, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-ipad-pro-m4-13-inch-long-term-review">iPad Pro M4</a>. I also plugged it into my Windows machine to transfer data from the internal SSD, and I routinely saw transfers of 910MB/s.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="THSx3yTcBpZT7LCRW2daRC" name="Seagate Ultra Compact SSD" alt="Seagate's Ultra Compact SSD against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/THSx3yTcBpZT7LCRW2daRC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The drive tends to get a little hot with extended transfers, but this hasn't been a problem as such in the month I used it. Coming in at just 24g, it's effortless to carry, and Seagate bundles a protective sleeve made out of silicone that does a good job safeguarding the drive itself and the USB-C connector. The drive gets IP54 dust and water resistance, but that's only when you use the protective sleeve.</p>

<p>There's also a lanyard that lets you attach the drive to a keyring, and the diminutive size combined with great build quality makes this a strong contender if you need rugged portable storage. On that note, the chassis itself is made out of aluminum, with Seagate using 35% recycled materials in the construction.</p>

<p>The USB-C port is based on the USB 3.2 Gen 2 standard, and it has a 10Gbps bandwidth. You get a tiny LED that serves as the status indicator, and I didn't have any problems with the drive in daily use. It showed up immediately on Windows, Android, iOS, and my iPads, and moving data was a breeze. The only issue is that there's no password protection — that's still an area where Samsung's SSDs have an inherent advantage.</p>

<p>I find stick SSDs to be less of a hassle to use with phones than traditional external SSDs (no cables to go missing), and Seagate did a great job overall with the Ultra Compact. It is small enough to take anywhere, plugs into any USB-C device without a problem, and has ultra-fast transfers. So if you need to extend the storage of your phone or just want a reliable external SSD to back up data on the go, Seagate's Ultra Compact is a terrific choice.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung's April update with a March security patch is now available for Galaxy Watch 6, 5, and 4 series in Korea and the U.S., following an initial release for the Watch 7 and Ultra.</li><li>The update, around 500MB depending on the model, focuses on security and stability enhancements.</li><li>More regions are expected to get the latest firmware in the coming weeks.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung is rolling out new updates to a few of its  Galaxy Watch models this week across regions, including Korea and the U.S.</p><p>In its April update, the Korean OEM seems to have snuck in a (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/04/29/samsung-galaxy-watch-update-april-2025/">9to5Google</a>) March security patch as well. The update first started rolling out for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-hands-on">Galaxy Watch 7</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Ultra</a> model <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/04/10/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-ultra-april-2025-update/">early last month</a>; however, it now appears to be a wider rollout as it is reaching older Galaxy Watch models for regions starting with Korea and also in the U.S.</p>

<p>Per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sammyguru.com/samsung-update-blitz-continues-with-a-big-release-for-galaxy-watch-4/?utm_source=twitter">multiple</a> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-watch-5-pro-big-update-no-improvements-changelog/">reports</a>, the Galaxy Watch 6, Watch 5, and Watch 4 series will be receiving this One UI 6-based update that measures around 500MB or more, depending on the watch model.</p><p>While the firmware brings the older March security patch, the changelog indicates that it also includes stability improvements next to security improvements. As the update just began the roll out, it is expected to reach more regions in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>In other Galaxy Watch news, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/new-leak-suggests-samsungs-galaxy-watch-ultra-2-could-launch-this-summer">new leak</a> has shared some information on what to expect from the next Ultra smartwatch from Samsung. Tentatively named Galaxy Watch Ultra 2, it is tipped to be launching alongside the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldables</a> — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Fold 7</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Flip 7</a> — with the Unpacked event likely happening in July. The leak has further mentioned that there won’t be any significant changes when it comes to the Ultra watch design and pricing.</p><p>However, the leak has also indicated that some notable changes can be seen when it comes to storage space — more of it is expected on the Ultra 2, and a new interface reminiscent of One UI 7 will also likely be included. With improved storage and perhaps a more user-friendly UI, the smartwatch might sport the same squircle look as the Galaxy Watch Ultra.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-92">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Samsung has finally confirmed the tri-fold phone is happening, with a potential late 2025 release.</li><li>In its Q1 2025 earnings call, Samsung credited its foldable lead to constant innovation and teased even more exciting updates this year.</li><li>The Galaxy G Fold might feature a 9.9-inch screen, a major upgrade over the 7.6-inch display on the Z Fold 6.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>After a long stretch of rumors and guesswork, Samsung has finally given a not-so-subtle nod that its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-tri-fold-name-change-hardware-specs-rumored">tri-fold phone is actually happening</a>. If its timing lines up, we could see it land sometime in late 2025.</p><p>In Samsung’s Q1 2025 earnings<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-q1-2023-earnings"> call</a>, the South Korean tech giant credited its lead in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone segment</a> to nonstop innovation and hinted at even more fresh ideas coming this year (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sammyguru.com/samsung-hints-at-2025-launch-for-its-long-rumored-tri-fold-device/" target="_blank">SammyGuru</a>). The goal is to boost its edge and get foldables into more hands by showing people what the tech can truly do.</p><p>It’s been a while since Samsung dropped a phone with a brand-new form factor, the last one being way back in 2020. So, it’s fair to say we’re overdue for something fresh. Right now, all signs point to the tri-fold design being the next big thing in its lineup.</p><p>Samsung has been stuck in a bit of a form factor loop since 2020, when the OG Galaxy Z Flip brought some fresh clamshell experience to pair with the book-style Fold. Since then, it has been all about yearly touch-ups.</p>
<h2 id="we-re-way-overdue-for-something-new-2">We’re way overdue for something new</h2>
<p>But now, with no word around any other wild new designs, the tri-fold is looking like the next bold move the company is lining up.</p><p>The tri-fold rumor has been floating around for years, but earlier this year, Samsung gave it some teeth. When it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/did-samsung-just-tell-us-a-tri-fold-phone-is-coming-soon">showed off a sneak peek of what’s coming</a>, one device looked like a tri-fold phone, and it finally turned all that chatter into something real.</p><p>Samsung also mentioned that foldables will bring “large-screen experiences for Fold,” which might be a subtle nod to the rumored 9.9-inch screen on the upcoming Galaxy G Fold. If true, that’s a big jump from the 7.6-inch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review" target="_blank">Galaxy Z Fold 6 display</a>.</p><p>During the earnings call, Samsung was asked about its foldable strategy, and the company made it clear it's all about boosting competitiveness through form factor innovation.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3119px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="AGyKNb3RmavuoSfaBqgTJA" name="samsung-unpacked-android-xr-triple-fold" alt="Samsung Unpacked 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AGyKNb3RmavuoSfaBqgTJA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3119" height="1755" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's a potential catch, though, with reports suggesting the Galaxy G Fold might only launch in China and Korea. If that’s the case, getting your hands on it outside those areas could be a bit of a challenge.</p><p>The initial quantity might be limited too. With this being Samsung’s first dive into the world of multi-fold phones, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-g-fold-could-come-sooner-than-you-expect">early talk points to it kicking things off with around 200,000 units</a>.</p><p>It’s a pretty calculated move to see how people react to this brand-new phone design. Since this is a totally fresh form factor for the company, it's keeping the first batch small and only releasing it in a few markets.</p>

<p>For years, the word "emulation" has been synonymous with "piracy." It doesn't help when you have bad actors leaking games before they're even released, only for others to livestream those same games, while telling people how to also illegally obtain the necessary files.</p><p>But for me, retro gaming and emulation are so much more than just seeing someone try and "stick it to the man." This is a topic that I could probably write enough to fill a short novel, but I won't be doing that here. Instead, I picked four reasons why being able to play a game from 1985 in 2025 is so important to me.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="m2ajATvio3JbYa2kVpsVaZ" name="super-mario-bros-3-on-retropie" alt="Super Mario Bros. 3 via RetroPie" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/m2ajATvio3JbYa2kVpsVaZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Admittedly, I didn't really dive deep into gaming until about 10 years ago or so. I would go through phases when I was addicted to heading over to a friend's house with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/gaming-accessories/we-need-more-accessories-like-the-new-backbone-one-xbox-edition">Xbox</a> to have a Halo LAN party. Which later transformed into playing Call of Duty with friends for countless hours. But for the most part, I just enjoyed going outside, touching grass, and playing sports.</p><p>To this day, there's nothing quite like being able to fire up Super Mario Bros. for the millionth time or Link's Awakening DX on one of my retro <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">gaming handhelds</a>. And if I'm in a particularly foul mood, there's always The Lion King for the Sega Genesis, which I've still never actually beaten.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kAQhdcpBTHwb247NfrTpw5" name="ayaneo-pocket-micro-review-14" alt="Zelda on the AYANEO Pocket Micro next to the Pocket DMG" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kAQhdcpBTHwb247NfrTpw5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's crazy to think about the number of classic games that are now just a couple of taps away. There are literally thousands upon thousands of games that can be stored and played from the slab of glass in your pocket. Of course, it doesn't feel exactly the same compared to playing on the original hardware. But there are things you can do to replicate the feeling of a CRT, as long as you're willing to spend some time tinkering.</p>
<h2 id="discover-all-new-experiences-2">Discover all new experiences</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="q9CNzMjcBt4AktGg2WqhbR" name="ps3-on-android-1" alt="Rayman on Pocket EVO with aPS3e on Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/q9CNzMjcBt4AktGg2WqhbR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Throughout the years, my family primarily stuck to Nintendo and Microsoft, with a bit of Sega thrown in the middle. The first Sony console any of us had was a PSP, and then later a PS Vita. Because of that, the only time I ever could play anything PlayStation was if I were to head over to a friend's house.</p><p>There are even some Nintendo consoles that I missed out on, such as the 3DS, GameCube, Wii, and Wii U. There are a whole lot of incredible games that I didn't get to enjoy firsthand. But now, all it takes is a few taps on my phone, and I'm piloting an X-wing alongside Luke Skywalker as part of Rogue Squadron.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5712px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Fr8qS98NFcVBhfm5hidqJh" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-ultra-gamesir-galileo-g8.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra with the GameSir G8 Galileo controller attached" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Fr8qS98NFcVBhfm5hidqJh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5712" height="3213" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Thanks to emulation, I'm able to dive into the library of PS1, PS2, and PS3 games that I never had the chance to play before. And until recently, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/whats-going-on-with-ps3-for-android-emulation">PS3 emulation on Android</a> was thought to be a pipe dream. That's no longer the case courtesy of RPCS3-Android, which has been merged into a newer RPCSX project.</p><p>If you had told me that I would be able to play PS3 games on a smartphone with an almost 8-inch screen that folds in half, I would've thought you lost your marbles. But that's exactly what I'm able to do, and it's just absolutely mind-boggling and incredible.</p>
<h2 id="pushing-devices-to-the-limit-2">Pushing devices to the limit</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AfV2VzNryHJejxrcNJEpUX" name="multiple-emulators-on-s25-ultra-odin-2-pocket-dmg-z-fold-6" alt="Emulation on Android devices with the Galaxy S25 Ultra, AYANEO Pocket DMG, Galaxy Z Fold 6, and AYN Odin 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AfV2VzNryHJejxrcNJEpUX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Whenever I get my hands on a new Android device, one of the first things I do after the initial setup process is load up a few <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-emulators-android">emulators</a> and ROMs. Switch is usually first, as that gives me a pretty good idea of what to expect right out of the box. But that's only part of the fun.</p><p>For example, say you picked up something like the AYN Odin 2 or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocket-s-review">AYANEO Pocket S</a>, and your favorite Switch game isn't running as smoothly as you'd have expected. Well, before giving up the goose entirely, there's actually quite a bit of tinkering that you can do.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZMXNGqG8sPRZfMtWhentvP" name="ayaneo-pocket-s-review-11.jpg" alt="AYN Odin 2 and Odin 2 Mini with Ayaneo Pocket S" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZMXNGqG8sPRZfMtWhentvP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To start, play around with the different settings and options that are built into the emulator you're using. The most common culprits are changing the Accuracy Level, turning off VSync, making sure that Docked Mode is enabled, etc. If you go through everything and only see marginal improvements, you're still not out of luck.</p><p>That's where <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/K11MCH1/AdrenoToolsDrivers">Turnip drivers</a> come into play, as these are custom-tuned drivers for the built-in GPU on your device. The problem here is that just because a new driver is available, it doesn't necessarily mean that it will actually resolve your issue. So I always recommend trying out a bunch of different drivers until the game is running the way you hoped.</p><p>Even then, there are limitations, as Turnip drivers are only compatible with Qualcomm Snapdragon-powered devices. When it comes to MediaTek, Exynos, or Tensor, then you're relying on a Mali GPU, and emulators won't even let you try to use a Turnip driver with a Mali GPU. Which means, what you see is what you get.</p>
<h2 id="one-more-thing-2">One more thing</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1998px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="8d5k5C6gNuGd4b5BbCYBpQ" name="turn-galaxy-z-fold-3-into-nintendo-ds-lifestyle-1" alt="Turn Galaxy Z Fold 3 into Nintendo DS" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8d5k5C6gNuGd4b5BbCYBpQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1998" height="1124" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In years past, the above reasons served their collective purpose as to why I've been enamored with retro gaming and emulation. However, something rather special happened almost a year and a half ago. At the time of this writing, it's been almost 450 days since I became a father.</p><p>He doesn't care one way or another about the teether in the shape of the NES controller, other than the fact that it makes his mouth feel better. Nor does he care about the Fisher Price controller that lights up and plays music, other than that it makes noise.</p><p>But more recently, he'll come and crawl up next to me on the couch while I'm playing some Pokémon Ruby on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/times-running-out-on-these-prime-day-gaming-handheld-deals">RG35XX SP</a> or Wind Waker on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/heres-why-im-getting-the-retroid-pocket-flip-2-and-the-pocket-classic">Retroid Pocket Flip 2</a>. Sure, part of it's the vibrant colors that draw him in, but he also just seems genuinely interested in whatever's happening.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="PyFrrdb6Rjkajnucyd5BCR" name="rabbit-r1-miyoo-mini-plus-game-boy-advance-sp.jpg" alt="Rabbit R1 next to Miyoo Mini Plus and Game Boy Advance SP" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PyFrrdb6Rjkajnucyd5BCR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To that end, while I don't want him to grow up any faster (seriously, how has it been 14+ months already?), I also can't wait to introduce him to some of the games that I played. But instead of being huddled around the family CRT, we can sit back and enjoy games on TVs that are much larger, much thinner, and won't have to worry about neck pain.</p><p>For the record, I've already started mentally planning how I'll get everything set up. But knowing me, I'll go through a million ideas first, only to figure out a way to connect a handheld, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/raspberry-pi">Raspberry Pi</a>, or my phone to a CRT TV.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-5g-advanced-2">What is 5G Advanced?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VdsLucrbnzL8i9uPFpzBKo" name="t-mobile-5g_2.jpg" alt="T Mobile 5g" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VdsLucrbnzL8i9uPFpzBKo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: T-Mobile)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Are you ready for 5G Advanced? Do you even know if you're ready, or if you need to be? No worries, let's take a quick look at what the next generation of connectivity looks like, and if you need to start looking for a phone that uses it, the next time you buy.</p>
<p>5G Advanced is a "friendly" name given to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.3gpp.org/specifications-technologies/releases/release-18">3GPP Release 18</a> standards. It's sometimes referred to as 5.5G, and it serves as a bridge between current technology and 6G. It offers (potentially) significant improvements to network speeds, efficiency, and even the network. Yes, that's a thing, too.</p><p>It's expected to be commercially deployed (that means the network equipment is ready) by the second half of 2025. Instead of focusing on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/mobile-broadband-5g-still-needs-fixing" target="_blank">mobile broadband</a> — achieving a good connection in more places — it has been developed to enhance connectivity options for industrial IoT (Internet of Things) devices and help them become more autonomous.</p><p>You might hear people tossing the word <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/metaverse">Metaverse</a> around, too. In theory, a connection with 10 Gbps throughput and ultra-low latency can help support immersive applications, but it cannot address the existing flaws and lack of direction. It's better to think of the things it can fix on its own, like server-based AI applications, telemedicine, or learning through VR, than lumping everything together.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PTtJR9XMAtT5k5vHSkyWGb" name="meta-quest-3-meta-quest-3s-glitchy" alt="The Meta Quest 3S stacked on top of a Meta Quest 3 with a glitch filter applied to the image" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PTtJR9XMAtT5k5vHSkyWGb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The standards put forth by the 3GPP (you know them as the people behind <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/mwc-2025">Mobile World Congress</a>) provide for a few things to make this a reality: up to 10 Gbps network speeds, network latency as low as 1 millisecond, better intelligent traffic management via AI, support for 100 times more connected devices per square kilometer, and the ability to do all this while reducing energy consumption by 30%.</p><p>It's essentially the same type of promises we see year after year from phone makers, claiming that things <em>could</em> be up to X% better.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-benefit-2">How do I benefit?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nJckbVR4AmCygx5RuYtjU6" name="waymo-current-legacy-vehicles.jpg" alt="Waymo's legacy car beside its more current model." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nJckbVR4AmCygx5RuYtjU6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1280" height="720" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Waymo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Indirectly, you'll benefit if (and that's a big if) cities harness the tech to become "smart" with network-connected utilities, traffic signals, parking meters, etc. With these working as intended, they will be more convenient for us to use.</p><p>You could also save money on your bills. If everything uses 30% less power to do more, those savings could be passed on to consumers. Not only will 5G Advanced help companies meet green energy goals, but it should also lower operating costs.</p><p>It's also a really big step towards a realistic fleet of self-driving vehicles. Maybe not like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/automotive/waymo-driverless-vehicles-downtown-phoenix">Waymo</a>, but autonomous freight transport needs this kind of tech behind it if it's ever to become a reality.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>5G Advanced is a big step towards better self-driving cars and can potentially save consumers money.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>More directly, it will solve problems in healthcare, especially in rural areas. A high-speed, low-latency network allows the use of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/googles-glass-enterprise-edition-industry-workers-gets-upgrade/">AR equipment</a> for training, as well as a clear benefit to the telemedicine industry. Since it's not done over a wire, the equipment can also be used in emergency service vehicles for more urgent applications.</p><p>If we had this 30 years ago, I might not be in a wheelchair today. For the sake of the next generation, I hope it pans out.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Mr8skv235NeD5miZHHjWGg" name="T-Mobile-store-logo.jpg" alt="T-Mobile store logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Mr8skv235NeD5miZHHjWGg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I know this isn't exactly what you're looking for, and you're wondering if this will improve <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones" target="_blank">your next phone </a>or if it's a specification you should look for. Seeing companies crow about their advancements, claiming how important they are without saying exactly why, doesn't help here, either.</p><p>The sad fact is that it's very unlikely that any of this makes a difference for consumer electronics outside of very niche cases. You'll be able to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/xbox-game-streaming-app-appears-google-play-store-wishlist-it-here">stream games</a> faster if you're on a faster network with lower latency. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oculus-quest-2-v28-update-adds-120hz-wireless-pc-vr-streaming-and-more">Streaming VR</a> won't be so terrible. Your phone, though, isn't going to be any faster because the current generation of hardware doesn't<em> need</em> the network to be any faster. You can only process so much information, and having it come in faster won't change anything. One day, though.</p><p>Some companies claim to have complete U.S. coverage for 5G Advanced soon, and some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/network/t-mobile-reaches-5g-advanced-nationwide-milestone-unlocks-the-modern-wireless-network-for-consumers-businesses-and-developers">even claim to have it today</a>, when in reality, they're using numerous older standards and labeling it a "Magenta Spin." This doesn't help nearly as much as telling why this improvement is important, even if it's not going to change your phone.</p>

<p>Wear OS (aka Android Wear) and Google Glass both went public in 2014, but they had nothing to do with one another. Now, Google should show off its new AR glasses at I/O 2025 later this month. But this time, Google would be smart to make Android watches part of its XR experience. Yes, really!</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-io-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">Google I/O 2025</a> starts on May 20, but Google and Samsung have been showing off Android XR demos for months, starting with the Samsung Moohan XR headset and most recently at an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-android-xr-smart-glasses-ted-2025">XR TED Talk</a> with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-gear/samsung-could-be-working-smart-glasses">"Project HAEAN"</a> AR glasses that record and memorize what you see.</p><p>Google has no Wear OS panels planned for I/O, but it will hold two Android XR panels. One's focused on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://io.google/2025/explore/technical-session-2">Android XR SDK and AI tools</a>, while the other centers on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://io.google/2025/explore/technical-session-22">building AR apps</a> by adding "3D models, stereoscopic video, and hand-tracking" to existing Android apps.</p><p>It's a reasonable bet that we'll see AR glasses tech on the I/O stage, in other words. Since I'll be attending I/O, I hope I'll finally have a chance to demo them and see how well the Gemini commands and gesture controls work.</p><p>But having watched <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az5QL_NLBvg">Marques Brownlee's Android XR demo</a> and read <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24319528/google-android-xr-samsung-project-moohan-smart-glasses">The Verge's AR glasses demo</a>, I can already tell that no matter how well they work, voice and gesture controls alone aren't going to cut it for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a>. And Android smartwatches are the obvious backup choice.</p>

<p>I tend to use controllers when I play VR games on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a>, but every time I've used hand tracking on a Quest, Apple Vision Pro, Snap Spectacles, and other XR devices, my response is usually, "Wow, this <em>almost</em> works!"</p><p>In a room that's too dark or in direct sunlight, the inside-out camera tracking will struggle to capture your hand gestures properly. In ideal lighting, with your hand always held up in the camera's view, you can pinch to select menu options with reasonable accuracy. But I still expect missed inputs and prefer the simplicity of a controller.</p><p>Now picture using these glasses <em>outdoors</em>, where these deliberate, unnatural gestures might make passersby think I'm gesturing <em>at them</em> — or just a weirdo.</p><p>Smart glasses are meant to blend in, but this is a double-edged sword; calling attention to the fact that I'm wearing tech will only bring back the "Glasshole" problem and make people uncomfortable. (Maybe they'll be called X-aRseholes?)</p>

<p>Gemini voice commands are a more seamless fit. The demos I've seen show that Gemini can carry out actions reliably after a few seconds to process. In the multimodal Live mode, you simply point at or focus on something to have Gemini answer your question about it — no controller required.</p><p>But when it comes to my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses</a> and asking the Meta AI to take photos, I (again) only really talk to the assistant when no one's around.</p><p>Google likes the idea of people talking freely to AR glasses at any time. And sure, maybe they'll become ubiquitous so that public AI chats are socially acceptable. But if I'm on public transit, in an office, or at the grocery store, I <em>might</em> ask the occasional quiet question, but I'd much rather have a less disruptive, non-spoken alternative.</p><p>Maybe you're less concerned about societal norms than me. You'll still have to worry about ambient noise disrupting commands or accidentally triggering Gemini. And there's always a few seconds of waiting for Gemini to process your request, and trying again if Gemini gets it wrong, while tapping buttons feels more immediate.</p>

<p>When Meta designed its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Orion AR glasses</a>, it also created an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-semg-wristband-whitepaper">sEMG neural band</a> that recognizes finger gestures so you can subtly trigger actions, without vocalizing or keeping your hands in view. Meta knew this problem needed to be solved to make AR glasses more viable, at some point.</p><p>But in Google and Samsung's case, they already have ready-made wearables with input screens, gesture recognition, and other tools that'd mesh surprisingly well with smart and AR glasses.</p>
<h2 id="why-wear-os-and-android-xr-should-sync-2">Why Wear OS and Android XR should sync</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="SUYun2bhF7fsxK5qmDnV5i" name="google-pixel-watch-3-google-tv-controls.jpg" alt="Google TV controls on Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SUYun2bhF7fsxK5qmDnV5i.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We mostly use Android watches to check notifications, track workouts, and ask Assistant questions. But they can also trigger actions on other devices: Taking a photo, unlocking your phone via UWB, toggling Google TV controls, checking your Nest Doorbell feed, and so on.</p><p>Imagine if Wear OS had an Android XR mode. It could still show phone notifications, but its display (when tilted-to-wake) would mirror whichever app you have open on your glasses. Contextual actions like video playback controls, taking a photo, or pausing a Gemini Live chat would trigger immediately with a tap.</p><p>Even better, imagine if you could twist the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3</a>'s crown or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8 Classic</a>'s rotating bezel like a scroll wheel in menus or browsers, specifically affecting whichever window you're looking at. That sounds much better than pinching and flicking your hand over and over!</p><p>Galaxy Watches support a few basic gestures like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-to-use-apple-watch-double-tap-on-galaxy-watch-6">double taps</a> and knocking, and I wonder if this could reinforce Android XR controls, offering a second source of information that you want to select or move something, even if the camera missed the input.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jriGiXXyBox8gzXnTUD28B" name="meta-ray-ban-smart-glasses-hypernova-mockup" alt="A mockup of what Meta Hypernova smart glasses could look like using transparent Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jriGiXXyBox8gzXnTUD28B.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I'd generally feel more excited about AR glasses if I knew I had a tactile backup option to voice commands, even if Gemini and hand gestures are the primary, expected control schemes. The only question in my mind is whether Google can make <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS</a> work as a controller.</p><p>This <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.patentlyapple.com/2025/04/a-new-samsung-patent-illustrates-android-xr-smartglasses-using-a-galaxy-ring-watch-to-navigate-the-xr-ui.html">patent site</a> spotted Samsung patents for using a smartwatch or smart ring for XR controls, though the article is painfully vague on details, except to say that the emphasis was more on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Galaxy Ring</a> than the Galaxy Watch.</p><p>It's evidence, at least, that Samsung's engineers are looking for alternative XR control schemes. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Project Moohan</a> XR headset may ship with controllers, but the eventual goal is to sell all-day smart glasses and AR glasses; those require a more subtle and consistent control scheme than gestures and commands — at least in my opinion.</p><p>I understand why Samsung's first instinct would be to use smart rings as controllers; they're seamless and don't have a separate OS to worry about. But until I hear otherwise, I'll keep arguing that Wear OS would be a better fit and more useful!</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge happens to be the most-awaited phone from the manufacturer, and it has seen a couple of delays ever since it was previewed at the Galaxy S25 series launch. While it was earlier set to launch in April, it didn’t happen, but the new leaked launch date is just a couple of weeks from now.</p><p>Tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/1917673864131203234/photo/1">Evan Blass on X</a> has shared the launch date teaser of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-teaser">Galaxy S25 Edge</a>, which is scheduled for May 13. The leaked image looks a lot like Samsung's official poster showcasing the phone sideways, also comes with a tagline “Beyond Slim” — presumably indicating it is the Galaxy S25 Edge after all. Now, it looks like the image has been taken down on the X post due to copyright issues, as seen below.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">FYI pic.twitter.com/Y9frwPeIvm<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1917673864131203234">April 30, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>The Galaxy S25 Edge is the new ultra-slim phone from Samsung that has been shown off alongside the Galaxy S25 trio. It carries a sleek, lightweight design (measuring around 5.8mm in thickness) and two primary cameras instead of three as seen on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> and S25 Plus models. The rear panel also looks significantly different from the trio as it sports an all-new camera visor. While the full specs of the device haven’t been announced by Samsung yet, it is expected to be powered by the same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-soc-for-galaxy-s25-series">Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a> as seen on the flagship trio.</p><p>However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/new-leak-shows-off-samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-in-titanium-variants">leaked renders</a> of the Galaxy S25 Edge later have showcased the device in all its colorways and the supposed Titanium finish. The slim phone is expected to come in Silver, Icy Blue, and Black colorways. The other expected specs comprise a 6.7-inch QHD+ display and a 3900mAh battery capacity.</p>

<p>It is encouraging to finally look at the launch date of the Galaxy S25 Edge, which was already anticipated because the initial rumored launch date was in April, as mentioned, and was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-delays-galaxy-s25-edge-release-from-april-to-may-or-june-2025">delayed</a> due to multiple <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/tech-issues-pushed-the-galaxy-s25-edges-launch">unknown reasons</a>.</p><p>The slim phones appear to be a new trend as a couple of other companies like Oppo, OnePlus, and Apple are releasing their first compact phones later this year. OnePlus is gearing up for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-13t-the-compact-powerful-phone-is-coming-to-india-as-oneplus-13s">OnePlus 13s launch</a> in India, which is a revamped version of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-13t-smal-display-flagship-power-china-launch">OnePlus 13T from China</a>.

That's different with the iPhone 16 Pro Max and the Pixel 9 Pro XL — which I use over the course of the year — so when it comes to these two devices, I usually go with a clear or leather case.</p>

<p>When accessory brand Torras asked if I'd be interested in taking a look at its Ostand OAir and OFitness collection, I was interested. While I used Spigen, ESR, and Mujjo cases in the past, two things about the Torras cases stood out: an integrated kickstand at the back, and vibrant colors.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PJkf6H57KfDNQ2B8tSnvBf" name="TORRAS iPhone 16 Pro Max Ostand Case" alt="TORRAS iPhone 16 Pro Max Ostand Case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PJkf6H57KfDNQ2B8tSnvBf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The brand sent over two colors in the OFitness collection — Mint Green and Coastal Blue — along with the three color variants available in the OAir series, and having used the cases for the better part of a month now, I'll admit that they're pretty great. Although they're bulkier, I predominantly used the OAir cases because of the added protection and better colors.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="b4UEW6nz2ewtKRHMbabzBf" name="TORRAS iPhone 16 Pro Max Ostand Case" alt="TORRAS iPhone 16 Pro Max Ostand Case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b4UEW6nz2ewtKRHMbabzBf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Torras did a great job with the color selection, and the OAir cases in particular add a vibrancy to the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max. The case has a textured finish at the sides that makes it easier to hold the phone, and the buttons don't interfere with tactility in any way whatsoever.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="7gP4hqmGXtYDbCTbyiwxAf" name="TORRAS iPhone 16 Pro Max Ostand Case" alt="TORRAS iPhone 16 Pro Max Ostand Case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7gP4hqmGXtYDbCTbyiwxAf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's a metal insert over the Camera Control button, and it makes accessing the button a little harder. If anything, I see it as a net positive as I tend to launch the camera accidentally, and the cover does a good job preventing that. You'll need to press harder to adjust the zoom level using the button, but again, I find it to be easier to use the onboard viewfinder controls.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="EagzSDTM9xyhurbZ6BU9Cf" name="TORRAS iPhone 16 Pro Max Ostand Case" alt="TORRAS iPhone 16 Pro Max Ostand Case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EagzSDTM9xyhurbZ6BU9Cf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The OAir case weighs 42g on its own, and when slotted into my iPhone 16 Pro Max, the overall weight was 269g. It definitely adds noticeable weight and bulk, but the upside is that you get rugged protection. The case has raised edges at the front that ensures the panel doesn't take any damage should the phone fall face-down — I tested this quite extensively, and it held up incredibly well.</p>

<p>What I like about the case is that the top and bottom sections have additional protection (Torras calls these airbags), and after a half-dozen tumbles, it did a thorough job safeguarding my phone. The back also has a raised profile over the cameras that ensures the modules don't get scratched easily.</p>

<p>You get the standard cutouts at the bottom around the USB-C port and speakers, and you'll have to use a charging cable with a slender connector; I mostly use cables with built-in power meters, and I wasn't able to connect these to the phone when the case was attached.</p>

<p>The best feature on the case is the built-in kickstand; it has full 360-degree swivel, so you can adjust the angle to your needs, and it locks the phone to that position. It hides away seamlessly when not in use, and it doesn't interfere with MagSafe at all; if anything, the case has really strong magnets, and I didn't see any issues while charging the iPhone 16 Pro Max with several Qi 2 stands.</p>

<p>The OFitness case also has the same kickstand and a similar texture finish at the sides, but you miss out on the protection at the corners. These cases are lighter at 36g, and while they're not as rugged as the OAir models, they still do a good job in daily use.</p>

<p>The OFitness <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://torraslife.com/collections/iphone-16-pro-max-cases/products/ostand-fitness-for-iphone-16-pro-max">cases cost $42.99 each</a>, and if you're interested in buying the OAir cases, you'll <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://torraslife.com/products/oair-for-iphone-16-pro-max?variant=42637851951146">need to shell out $64.99</a>. That's on the higher end of the scale as these cases go, but the reliable protection combined with great color choices and built-in kickstand makes it an easy recommendation.</p>

<p>The Motorola Razr 2024 is our top pick for the best budget foldable phone, recommended for most people looking to enter this segment. It's not too expensive considering the technology you get, and it does a fine job for most tasks. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-arrives-as-a-trio">Motorola Razr 2025</a> is the latest refresh, arriving in early May, and it comes with some notable upgrades.</p><p>If you were considering between the Motorola Razr 2025 vs. Razr 2024, should you pay full price for the new model or save a bit and get the older one? Either way, the base Razr model is one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone" target="_blank">best budget foldables</a> on the market. The 2024 model had issues with camera quality and audio from the speakers, which we're hoping have been addressed in the 2025 refresh. Let's compare the two and see what's similar and what has been improved in the new model.</p>

<p>Motorola's Razr 2025 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-arrives-as-a-trio">will go on sale starting May 15</a>, and pre-orders will start on May 7. The new Razr comes in at the same price of $699.99 in the U.S. for 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. It comes in new Pantone colors called Spring Bud, Gibraltar Sea, Parfait Pink, and Lightest Sky. There should be pre-order and trade-in offers too, which can offset some of the cost. If you don't want to buy it unlocked, the Razr 2025 should also be available with all the major U.S. carriers, for a small monthly fee.</p>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2024-review">Motorola Razr 2024</a> is still very much available, and my guess is, will be for some time. Motorola is selling it for $100 lower than the launch price at $599.99 for the singular variant with 8GB RAM and 256GB of storage. The phone comes in Spritz Orange, Koala Grey, and Beach Sand. Like the 2025 model, you can buy this unlocked from all the big online retailers like Best Buy, Amazon, and Walmart or via the three major carriers in the U.S..</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="85zvTUz22GC6EASuuRR5gh" name="Motorola-Razr-2024-review-05.jpg" alt="The Motorola Razr 2024 display open at an angle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/85zvTUz22GC6EASuuRR5gh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Motorola Razr 2025 is nearly impossible to tell apart from the Razr 2024 model, save for the new colors. The dimensions of both phones are virtually identical, as they have a thickness of 7.3mm and weigh 188 grams. What's not visibly apparent are the new changes made to the Razr 2025's build. The hinge now gets a titanium reinforcement, which is said to be 4x stronger than before. The new model is also IP48 rated (IPX8 on the Razr 2024), which finally adds official dust proofing, just like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>.</p><p>In principle, you <em>should</em> be able to use the same cases for the 2024 Razr on the 2025 model.</p><p>Motorola hasn't made many changes to the displays on the new Razr 2025 either. Honestly, it didn't really have to, considering the 2024 Razr had pretty epic screens for its price segment.</p><p>Both phones feature a 6.9-inch folding LTPO AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and up to 3,000 nits of peak brightness. The outer display measures 3.6 inches, and it too is an AMOLED panel with a 90Hz refresh rate, and up to 1,700 nits of peak brightness. You get Gorilla Glass Victus for the outer displays, which offers good durability.</p><p>We're yet to test the Motorola Razr 2025, but in all likelihood, the displays and ergonomics should be identical to the 2024 model. In our review of the latter, we loved the vibrancy and richness of the displays, the premium textures of the construction, and the fact that you can open apps like Google Maps directly from the outer display.</p>
<h2 id="motorola-razr-2025-vs-razr-2024-hardware-and-specs-2">Motorola Razr 2025 vs. Razr 2024: Hardware and specs</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="UciUWMuPWhajyHcQaw3GCQ" name="Motorola-Razr-2025-hands-on-4" alt="The Razr 2025 with Moto AI on the cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UciUWMuPWhajyHcQaw3GCQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Motorola Razr 2025 features a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-7400-7400x-ultra-efficient-gaming-ai-chips" target="_blank">MediaTek Dimensity 7400X</a> SoC, which is likely to be more advanced (and more AI-capable) than the Dimensity 7300X in the Razr 2024. But if you compare the specs of both chips a bit more closely, the only real change is a 100MHz bump in CPU clock speed in the new model, while pretty much everything else is the same.</p><p>Translated, the Razr 2025 should perform nearly identically to the 2024 model in real-world app usage and probably somewhat better. We might see a minor bump in benchmark numbers, but that's about it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iVVpGJVGyrbBpc4uBFMXNZ" name="Motorola-Razr-2024-review-02.jpg" alt="The Motorola Razr 2024 cameras" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iVVpGJVGyrbBpc4uBFMXNZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What has actually improved is the battery capacity. The Razr 2025 features a larger 4,500mAh capacity compared to the 4,200mAh capacity in the Razr 2024. We were already quite happy with the Razr 2024's battery life, and we're excited that the 2025 model should fare even better.</p><p>Charging speeds have remained the same, though, at 30W wired and 15W wireless. You'll also need to buy a compatible charger from Motorola separately or choose from any of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-phone-charger">best USB-C chargers</a> on the market.</p><p>The 2024 Razr didn't have stellar cameras, despite its decent specs on paper. Compared to the Razr Plus 2024, the standard Razr produced overprocessed images when shooting during the day, especially with HDR shots. The camera app was also quite sluggish at times, which really took away from the whole photography experience.</p><p>As for camera specs, both phones have nearly the same sensors on paper. There's a 50MP primary camera with an f/1.7 aperture and optical stabilization, a 13MP ultrawide with autofocus so it can take macro photos, and a 32MP selfie camera in the folding screen that's capable of 4K 30fps videos.</p><p>These were some of the things we experienced when we reviewed it back in August 2024, so we're hoping these issues have been addressed on the 2025 Razr. Pantone-validated color and skin tones for the primary camera are new additions, so we'll have to see how this translates into actual photo quality.</p>

<p>Motorola is doubling down on its AI efforts in the Razr 2025 with all-new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a> features. The AI suite, previously in beta, now offers features like notification summarization, recording transcripts, the ability to recall information, and lots more, via Catch Me Up, Pay Attention, and Remember This.</p><p>All these features now work in tandem with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> and Gemini Live. The Razr 2025 ships with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a>, and it will be getting three years of OS upgrades and four years of security patches.</p><p>The Motorola Razr 2024 shipped with Android 14, but it too is destined to get three OS upgrades, which means it will be relevant for a few more years. All of the new AI features in the 2025 model should make their way to the Razr 2024, too, considering the chipset is essentially the same. Motorola doesn't have the best track record for timely software updates, which is the only real issue here.</p>

<p>If you're looking to get yourself a new foldable phone, I'd say <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-2025-razr-makes-me-like-last-years-model-even-more">wait for the Motorola Razr 2025</a> to go on sale and pick it over the 2024 model. You should be able to snag some pre-order offers and get the price down a bit.</p><p>The reason for opting for the latest model is simple — it costs the same, offers dustproofing, a larger battery, a stronger hinge, and the latest software. Not to mention a choice of some pretty cool new colors. Existing owners of the Razr 2024 need not upgrade to the 2025 model as there's not much to be gained.</p><p>The 2024 Razr is still a great buy at $100 less than the 2025 model. If you're not in any hurry, I'd wait for some of the big sales when Motorola drops massive price cuts on its phones. Other than the average cameras, the rest of the phone is pretty great even in 2025, and it makes an even better deal if you can find it for under $500.</p>
