                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>YouTube highlighted an upcoming test that brings picture-in-picture viewing during mid-roll ads.</li><li>The service intends to create a less disruptive experience as it continues its fight against ad blockers.</li><li>YouTube's war against ad blockers involved cutting users off from viewing its content if they had one while also testing new server-side ads.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>YouTube is kickstarting a test for a limited group of users that might alleviate the headache surrounding its recent ad war.</p><p>On YouTube&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/18138167?hl=en&msgid=289284231">features and experiments</a> page, the platform detailed the beginning of picture-in-picture (PIP) videos during mid-roll (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/youtube-tests-pip-ads-3468412/">Android Authority</a>). The post states that this feature will become available to creators, giving the option to enable picture-in-picture for ads played <em>during </em>their content.</p><p>YouTube didn&apos;t make the specifics clear about this new PIP format for mid-roll ads. So, either the creator&apos;s content will morph into a smaller display, leaving the ad to take over the player in full, or vice versa.</p><p>The service adds that the new format is intended to help creators facilitate a less disruptive experience for their viewers. Moreover, it seems that creators <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7385599?sjid=12635603178992791037-NA#channel_settings_midroll">can find this new option</a> within the "Monetization" settings of the Live Control Room.</p><p>"Some viewers on select devices" are said to experience the new PIP ad format in the months ahead. Those on mobile and desktop should keep their eyes out moving forward. YouTube creators should also gain the new mid-roll ad option around that same time.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="6pvjASLAuGSMQzSoFxqBqG" name="YouTube-Premium-lifestyle.jpg" alt="YouTube Premium homepage on Android" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6pvjASLAuGSMQzSoFxqBqG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Less disruptive ads would be a welcome sight, as mid-roll ads currently rip users away from their content. More importantly, this alternate method could be seen as a way for YouTube to make <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-global-efforts-clock-ad-blockers">its strong stance on ads</a> more palatable. The platform recently started cracking down on users packing an ad-blocker by cutting off the video stream if the website detects the add-on.</p><p>If they wanted their content back, users could whitelist YouTube or disable the ad-blocker altogether. The company gave ad-block users "three strikes" before they were banned from watching videos.</p><p>Google then reiterated how important ads are for YouTube, as they generate revenue for the platform, but watching ads supports your favorite creators.</p><p>YouTube&apos;s efforts don&apos;t end there, as it was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-server-side-injectable-ads-test">spotted testing server-side ads</a> just before the summer. The ads would appear as an "injection" into the video stream instead of appearing as a separate entity. The latter is how your ad-blocker would spot and keep them from sight. With injectable ads, ad-blockers would have difficulties sensing and blocking them.</p><p>Of course, users can always grab <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-premium">YouTube Premium</a>, which is likely the road we&apos;re pushed toward. However, we&apos;ll have to see how this new, less disruptive mid-roll ad operates and whether we can stomach it.</p>

<hr>
<p>We&apos;re nearly midway through the first full week of August and Google is starting to push its latest security update to its portfolio of phones.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/289456705/google-pixel-update-aug-2024?hl=en&sjid=18076123174810562378-NC">community post</a>, Google detailed the contents of its August 2024 patch notes, which aim to solve some persistent Pixel problems. The Pixel 5a (5G), Pixel 7 series, Pixel 8, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">8 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Pixel Tablet</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a> will download version <strong>AP2A.240805.005</strong>. </p><p>Those with a Pixel 6 series device will grab AP2A.240805.005.<strong>F1</strong> while the Pixel 8a sees AP2A.240805.005.<strong>A1</strong>.</p><p>Headlining the August update are a couple of display and graphics problems still plaguing the phones. Google states the patch should solve a "screen brightness flicker" that would occur under "certain conditions." The post states this fix specifically involves the Pixel 8 and 8 Pro.</p><p>Another supplementary fix rolls in to bolster the performance of a Pixel&apos;s screen alongside stability enhancements. Users with a Pixel 8 are in the crosshairs of this particular fix.</p><p>The rest of the changelog is as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Fix for issue occasionally causing devices to be in a reboot loop after factory reset in certain conditions (Pixel 6 series)</li><li>Fix for stability issues when switching from a user without a screen lock, to a user with a screen lock under certain conditions (every eligible Pixel phone)</li></ul>

<p>Google typically offers more insight into its latest security update via the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/pixel/2024-08-01">Android Bulletin</a>; however, this month&apos;s offering is light. The company mentioned that a "High" severity issue regarding a Pixel subcomponent was corrected in August. Three more "Moderate" level fixes arrived for Qualcomm components, such as the Pixel camera and WLAN, that showed signs of issues.</p><p>A standout fix for August is Google&apos;s fix for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-6-factory-reset-might-zap-your-phone">reboot loop problem</a> <em>after </em>factory resetting a Pixel 6 series device. Users quickly reported that their Pixel 6 failed to turn on properly after a complete rest. The failure was accompanied by an error message stating that Android couldn&apos;t load and that the user&apos;s data "may be corrupt."</p><p>Google informed users of a workaround to avoid any problems, but a concrete fix wasn&apos;t readily available — until now.</p><p>This update comes just after Google started rolling out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-august-2024-update">August 2024 patch for the  Pixel Watch models</a>.</p><p>Let&apos;s also not forget that Google is preparing for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-event-2024-date-announced">hardware event on August 13</a> that should reveal the next Pixel 9 series, the Pixel Fold successor, and more.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google has started rolling out the latest August update to Pixel Watch models as of Monday (August 5). The update will bring the latest security patch for the original Pixel Watch and the Pixel Watch 2.</p><p>The latest update doesn&apos;t bring any radical changes to the Pixel Watch models and is a pretty minor security update, as noted by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelwatch/thread/289284148/google-pixel-watch-update-august-2024?hl=en&sjid=7303768851874470255-NA">changelog</a> shared via the community blog.</p><p>The Pixel Watch and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a> owners will receive the Wear OS 4-powered update bearing <strong>TWD9.240805.001.A2</strong> version. Although it is the latest security patch, which should technically be August 5, 2024, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/08/05/pixel-watch-august-2024-update/">9to5Google</a> notes that it is still July 5, 2024, even after installing it.</p>
<p>Google says that the rollout will be in phases over the next week and will depend on the carrier and the device. Owers of both Pixel Watch models will receive a notification on their smartwatches once the OTA update becomes available. Meanwhile, Google has also started rolling out the August update for its Pixel phones, including models ranging from the Pixel 5a (5G) to the most recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a>.</p><p>In other news, Google is gearing up for its Pixel products&apos; <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-event-2024-date-announced">launch event</a> on August 13, which should probably also mark the official rollout of Android 15 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a>.</p>

<ul><li>The Connect IQ app for Garmin watch faces and apps will now take Garmin Pay payments.</li><li>Garmin recommends devs charge $4.99 for content.</li><li>Disney (Star Wars, Marvel), TaylorMade, Porsche, NASA, and GoPro make up the first wave of ConnectIQ paid faces and apps.</li><li>Previously, third-party devs could only make money through third-party services like PayPal.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Garmin wants to make its Connect IQ app more attractive to third-party developers by making it easier for users to pay for their content directly through the app and their Garmin Pay account. </p><p>Connect IQ had no payment method up until now, so developers employed third-party platforms, asking users to make voluntary donations after installing the watch face. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a> owners, meanwhile, couldn&apos;t see in the app how much developers expected them to pay for their content.</p><p>Now, the Garmin Connect IQ app shows prices directly in the app, simplifying the process for both sides. Garmin will take a 15% cut of profits, lower than the typical 30% fee that app stores charge. They&apos;ve also confirmed that they "will continue to allow developers to use third-party monetization systems" if they prefer.</p><p>"Enabling premium apps allows third-party developers to be rewarded for their hard work," says Dan Bartel, Garmin VP of Global Consumer Sales. "We are thrilled that some of the largest brands in the world have joined us to launch new watch faces and apps."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="K9bKSxQ93sx6z8DsDgit4Q" name="garmin-connect-iq-premium-watch-faces.jpg" alt="New premium watch faces in Garmin Connect IQ" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/K9bKSxQ93sx6z8DsDgit4Q.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To showcase the "new" Connect IQ marketplace, Garmin added a few premium watch faces from partners like Disney. For instance, there is a Grogu watch face with changing poses throughout the day, as well as Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, and Tony Stark watch faces. All of these cost $4.99, Garmin&apos;s "suggested retail price" for all watch faces.</p><p>Other new premium watch faces include NASA watch faces that showcase new space-themed photography every hour, a TaylorMade watch face with a matching "dimple pattern of a TP5 golf ball," and three Porsche watch faces based on its wordmark, crest, and 917 Salzburg livery design.</p><p>Most intriguingly, Garmin has added a GoPro Camera Control app that lets you start or stop recordings or take photos directly from your Garmin watch. That&apos;s the kind of smart function that Garmin watches traditionally haven&apos;t supported. It costs $5.99.</p><p>Connect IQ will still offer free watch faces, but developers who previously considered making them as a hobby and using PayPal donations to make money as too much of a hassle might now start charging users instead. This could lead to more creative watch faces, but it could also make downloading them a little costlier.</p><p>Garmin recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/youtube-music-is-now-on-compatible-garmin-smartwatches">added YouTube Music to Garmin watches</a> via Connect IQ, which already has a few well-known apps like Spotify, Deezer, Amazon Music, and Komoot — all of which require subscriptions to work. Beyond these, perhaps this Connect IQ facelift could attract more developers to sync their devices with Garmin watches, knowing they can profit directly.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google&apos;s focus on AI continues as a recent app update teases Gemini&apos;s capabilities on your earbuds.</p><p>Discovered in version 15.31 of the Google app, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/08/05/gemini-earbuds-ai-assistant/">9to5Google</a> states the company is preparing to launch "Gemini on Earbuds." It seems Pixel Bud owners should prepare to see a notification informing them of Gemini&apos;s newfound in-ear capabilities. The string description, which is what users will see on their phones, reads, "Your new AI assistant is on your headphones."</p><p>The code strictly mentions "<strong>gemini_on_buds</strong>," which <em>could</em> mean Google is planning to support over-ear and in-ear audio sources with its AI model. The publication also spotted another feature description: "Talk to Gemini on earbuds."</p>

<p>Anyone who watched Google I/O 2024 or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-biggest-announcements">caught a recap</a> will know how AI-heavy the company&apos;s future is. More importantly, Gemini&apos;s existence has continued to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-does-gemini-mean-for-google-assistant">move in on the old Assistant</a>, pushing it out for the latest AI model. It&apos;s likely that with the expected launch of the Pixel Buds Pro 2, users can touch and hold a bud to summon Gemini — which is how the current line of buds surface the Assistant.</p><p>Additional findings about "Gemini on Earbuds" pair well with what was discovered earlier this year <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-gemini-app-will-come-to-headphones-that-support-google-assistant">during a Google app beta</a>. The APK dive produced an error message that highlighted Google&apos;s work to "expand availability" and bring Gemini to headphones. A support document stated that Gemini isn&apos;t intended to "replace" Assistant on non-mobile devices, likely due to its visual reliance.</p><p>So, it remains to be seen just how much Gemini can handle audibly before throwing users to their phones.</p><p>We&apos;re expecting the Pixel Buds Pro 2 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-event-2024-date-announced">on August 13</a>. However, an early ad for an accessory might&apos;ve spoiled a design change. A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/pixel-buds-pro-2-leaked-ad-design">Spigen ad for a Buds Pro 2 case</a> showed off a slightly bulkier device in the classic egg-shaped charging case. There&apos;s a chance that the bulkier body packs in internal improvements, though that&apos;s just speculation. </p>

<p><strong>P asks:</strong></p><p><em><strong>I am using an iPhone 14 Pro. I send a Signal text to an Android phone, it shows a blue bubble like an iMessage. Does this use my data?</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>If I send an iMessage to the same Android phone, it shows a green bubble. Am I using my data?</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Thank you.</strong></em></p>
<p>Nothing on our phones is as confusing (and ever-changing) as messaging. There are plenty of apps, Apple and Android do it differently, and in most of the world everyone is just using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whatsapp">WhatsApp</a>. With Apple focusing on supporting the RCS standard, it seems like everyone is talking about messaging but none of the companies involved take the time to make it simple.</p><p>Your questions are great, and I think a lot of folks wonder about the same things, especially if they aren&apos;t using an unlimited data plan. I&apos;ll answer them really quickly, and then we can explain it further.</p>
<p>Signal and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/rcs-vs-sms-vs-imessage-whats-difference">iMessage</a> (the official iOS messaging app) have nothing to do with each other. If you send a Signal message to someone with an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> using the Signal app, it&apos;s more like using Facebook Messenger than the iMessage app. The bubble is blue because Signal is simply using the color blue for them.</p><p>Sending a message with the Signal app uses your data connection or your Wi-Fi.</p><p>When you use the iMessage app to send a "regular" message to an Android phone, it&apos;s not being sent as an iMessage; it gets sent as an old-style SMS text (for now). In the iMessage app, SMS messages are shown in green.</p><p>Sending a message like this <em>doesn&apos;t</em> count against your data, but it does count against any limit on SMS your plan might have.</p>

<h2 id="how-messaging-apps-handle-my-monthly-data-2">How messaging apps handle my monthly data</h2>
<p>A lot of this confusion with Signal is because, as late as last year, Android users of the Signal app could use it to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-text-messaging-apps">replace their SMS app</a>. All texts and Signal messages went through the same app, with Signal messages being encrypted and having a richer connection to better send photos or other media.</p><p>I used Signal this way until the app was changed, and it is no longer a candidate for Android&apos;s default messages app. Yes, if you have a lot of messages, the only way you can quickly figure out what is what is by the bubble color.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GB5TtmLRcpbMih8aXYemjj" name="Google-Messages-iMessage-green-bubble.jpg" alt="Google Messages on an Android phone and iMessage on an iPhone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GB5TtmLRcpbMih8aXYemjj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I still use Signal as my messaging app of choice with the other people I talk to, but they need to <em>use</em> the Signal app, too. It&apos;s not a bad idea to have a fully encrypted and open-sourced messenger that is regularly checked by security professionals to ensure its quality.</p><p>Of course, it&apos;s more convenient to just use Google Messages/iMessage (or WhatsApp) because that&apos;s what your friends use.</p>
<p>The Apple Messages app is changing, too. The coming version of iOS is going to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-why-imessage-rcs-support-important">support what is known as RCS messaging</a>. This is the new messaging standard put forth by the same people who governed SMS and it&apos;s something almost every phone carrier in the world supports at some level.</p><p>Apple&apos;s RCS isn&apos;t going to be like Google&apos;s RCS, though, because Google was an early adopter of the protocol and had to add its own "stuff" onto it to make it better. Google&apos;s RCS platform supports just about everything iMessage does, including end-to-end encryption. The current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-rcs-and-why-it-important-android">RCS</a> standard doesn&apos;t have that built-in just yet, but I expect it will soon.</p><p>It also appears that RCS messages on iPhones <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/apple-announces-rcs-support-coming-to-iphone#section-update">will still use green bubbles</a>, though, which will probably make things still a little confusing for some.</p>
<p>Nowadays, it doesn&apos;t matter as much what messaging app you use because they all support the same types of features. It didn&apos;t used to be that way which is why apps like Signal gained popularity.</p><p>There will always be plenty of messaging platforms and each will say they are the best. Choice is great and we can pick the one that we like.</p>

<ul><li>A new Pixel Watch 3 leak shows the regular model in action next to its bigger sibling.</li><li>The design will likely remain the same as the Watch 2 but with slightly smaller bezels.</li><li>The leaked promo also reveals the latest fitness features for the Pixel Watch 3.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google&apos;s big launch event is just two weeks away, and we’re expecting to see new Pixel phones, including a foldable, plus the Pixel Watch 3 series. Leaks are still rolling in, and the latest one gives us a sneak peek at the Pixel Watch 3, highlighting its new features.</p><p>The leak comes from Steve Hemmerstoffer, who had already leaked a lot of Pixel stuff, spoiling all the fun for Google before the launch event. The latest leak includes a promo video of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3</a> in Spanish.</p>
<div class="looped-video"><video class="lazyload-in-view lazyloading" data-src="https://www.androidheadlines.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Pixel-Watch-3-Promo.mp4" autoplay loop muted playsinline src="https://www.androidheadlines.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Pixel-Watch-3-Promo.mp4"></video></div>
<p>The leaker paired with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/exclusive-google-pixel-watch-3-promo-video">Android Headlines</a> to showcase the newest promo, which shows the Pixel Watch 3 in two different sizes — the regular 41mm size and the latest 45mm dial. Aside from the new size, nothing has significantly changed on the upcoming smartwatch in terms of design. Again, it comes with a circular dial with the rotatory crown on the right pane.</p><p>The bezels, however, appear smaller than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a>, and it is particularly noticeable on the new bigger 45mm dial. The promo further confirms several health tracking features for the smartwatch as well as various watch faces and tiles users can play with. For instance, a new Cardio Load feature is quite similar to what users are accustomed to with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fitbit">Fitbit watches</a>. </p><p>Additionally, users can utilize real-time coaching to beat their personal best. The Pixel Watch 3 should also be greeting users with a Morning Brief feature daily to get started during the day.</p>
<p>Other expected features of the Pixel Watch 3 include a battery capacity similar to last year, with a promise of a 24-hour battery. It is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-3-imagery-google-fitbits-features-leak">rumored</a> to have 20% faster charging speeds than before, and that is for the 41mm model. The pricing leak from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/exclusive-google-pixel-watch-3-price">Android Headlines</a> indicates that the Pixel Watch 3 should likely start at $349 for the Wi-Fi model, and the LTE model can go up to $449.</p><p>Meanwhile, the 45mm model will probably start at $399, whereas the LTE model should bump its price to $499. In comparison, the latest counterpart, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-hands-on">Galaxy Watch 7</a>, starts at $299 in the U.S.</p>

<p>The next generation of home entertainment is here but with a twist as Google double dips to add smart device controls.</p><p>Today (August 6), Google bids farewell to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/chromecast-with-google-tv-hd-review">old Chromecast dongle</a> and introduces the sleek new TV Streamer. In a blog post, the company highlights that this new "entertainment and smart home hub" gives you access to YouTube TV, Netflix, Disney+, Apple TV, and more.</p><p>Additionally, there are a plethora of free, live TV options, which Google states reach nearly 800 channels.</p><p>Compared to the Chromecast dongle, the Google TV Streamer offers twice the memory and 32GB of storage. Google states such internal enhancements should aid the box in loading apps much faster. Plus, users can utilize 4K HDR, Dolby Vision, and Dolby Atmos for clear, crisp, and well-pronounced sound and visuals.</p>

<p>The Google TV Streamer includes the company&apos;s redesigned remote control, featuring a textured back and a restructured button layout. The company states users can program the new customizable button to open their frequently-used apps or to switch inputs. Users can also rediscover the remote through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a>&apos;s voice functionality, instead of digging through the couch.</p><p>Other additions include Google&apos;s implementation of its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">AI model, Gemini</a>. The company states its AI will make it "even easier" to find what you should watch next. Through the TV Streamer, Gemini will piggyback off your "preferences" to create a curated selection of content it thinks you might enjoy.</p><p>These suggestions will be based on movies and shows available to viewers through their subscriptions. The AI will also display reviews, summaries, and "season-by-season" breakdowns to help viewers make an informed choice.</p><p>After connecting a Google account, users can dive into their Photos album and use it in the Sreamer&apos;s Ambient mode. This will create a screensaver that&apos;s a trip down memory lane or users can lean on Gemini for an AI-generated piece of art instead. Google adds that users can connect their TV Streamer to their internet via Wi-Fi or an ethernet cable.</p>

<p>The Google TV Streamer has another side which is the availability of smart home control options. Users can control various <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/best-smart-home-devices">smart home devices</a> from their living room, like Google&apos;s devices or those <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/matter-1-3-upgrade">with Matter support</a>. With hands-free capabilities, users can turn off their lights or start automation. The box doubles as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/matter#section-what-is-thread">Thread border router</a>, giving users more reach and reliability for their smart home devices.</p><p>Alternatively, users can utilize the TV Streamer&apos;s "Google Home panel," which lets them view a live feed of their connected camera, alter the temperature, and more. Google states the box&apos;s smart home support works well with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/the-new-nest-thermostat-has-a-better-display-and-you-can-personalize-its-home-screen">new Nest Learning Thermostat</a>, too.</p>

<p>The TV Streamer isn&apos;t losing its casting feature as users can start something on their Android phone and then throw it onto the TV. The ability to control music from the TV is another way the Streamer adds to a seamless at-home entertainment experience.</p><p>The Google TV Streamer is available for pre-order today for $100 at the Google Store and third-party retailers. The device is available in Porcelain and Hazel colorways.</p>

<hr>
<p>Almost a decade after the last refresh to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nest-thermostat-review">Nest thermostat</a>, Google today launched the fourth-generation Nest Learning Thermostat with a customizable home screen, a new “Dynamic Farsight” feature, and a nearly bezel-less display.</p><p>The new Nest thermostat is available to buy in the U.S. for $280, with shipping scheduled to start on August 20. Each thermostat comes with a Nest Temperature Sensor (2nd Gen). If you need extra sensors for more precise temperature control, they&apos;re available for $40 each or $100 for a three-pack.</p><p>At this price, the new Nest thermostat is Google’s priciest model yet, but it may arguably be worth it with the advanced Nest Temperature Sensor included. You can get it in Polished Obsidian, Polished Silver, and Polished Gold finishes.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="NSDaSgCETBMXfPc5uCHPVi" name="nest-learning-thermostat-4th-gen-colors-render.jpg" alt="Nest Learning Thermostat (4th Gen) Color options" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NSDaSgCETBMXfPc5uCHPVi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google says the new temperature sensor is designed to smooth out temperature differences throughout your home.</p><p>You can set the thermostat to focus on the temperature of one room or balance the climate across several spaces with extra sensors. Users can also choose which sensors to prioritize at different times of the day.</p><p>Google has kept the Nest&apos;s iconic stainless steel casing but paired it with a larger, rounded glass display. The new crystal LCD screen is now 2.7 inches, which is 60% bigger than before.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="uxuyBUSfwF6bNdVougL4km" name="nest-learning-thermostat-4th-gen-changing-temp-promo.jpg" alt="Nest Learning Thermostat (4th Gen) changing temperature lifestyle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uxuyBUSfwF6bNdVougL4km.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The new smart thermostat breaks away from the previous flat design by reducing the bezel around the display. This allows the user interface to extend beyond the old black border seen on the third-gen model.</p><p>Google has also packed a ton of AI into the new thermostat. It can set up smart schedules that learn your preferred temperatures and adjust accordingly. If your routine changes, like waking up earlier or going to bed later, Smart Schedule tweaks itself to keep you comfortable and save energy.</p><p>The classic Eco feature has been upgraded to Adaptive Eco, which smartly balances energy savings and comfort. It figures out the best indoor temperature based on outside conditions, so you’ll return to a comfy home within an hour of arriving, as per Google.</p><p>Users can either let the energy-saving tips automate themselves or manually approve or decline them through the Google Home app.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="Nb5WhdHQrXD8GptKnQmNN5" name="nest-temperature-sensor-2nd-gen-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Google Nest Temperature Sensor (2nd Gen) lifestyle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Nb5WhdHQrXD8GptKnQmNN5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Nest Temperature Sensor (2nd Gen) </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A big perk of the latest-generation thermostat is that it works with any Matter-enabled smart home system. So, you’re not stuck with just <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-home">Google Home</a>—you can also integrate it with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-alexa">Alexa</a>, HomeKit, or SmartThings.</p><p>Another upgrade is Dynamic Farsight, which takes the old Farsight feature to the next level. Previously, the thermostat&apos;s display would light up when you got close, showing you key information like the temperature, weather, and time.</p><p>Now, Dynamic Farsight gives a customized visual experience. From afar, you can set what shows up on the display, and as you get closer, more details appear. It can display weather conditions with visuals like cloud images for foggy days and offer clock faces inspired by the Pixel Watch. Plus, you can design your own home screen look.</p><p>These upgrades make the new Nest Learning Thermostat a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-thermostat-multiple-zones">top contender in the smart thermostat</a> market. Its Matter compatibility, advanced temperature sensor, and sleek design put it ahead of the competition.</p>
