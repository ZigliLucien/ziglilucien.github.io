<ul><li>Fitbit is rolling out its integration process for users Health Connect data.</li><li>Users will find options to sync active calories burned, basal body temperature, and basal metabolic rate statistics from Health Connect.</li><li>The "You" tab now houses a new "Records" tab that will let users toggle Health Connect stats on the "Today" tab.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is rolling out integration for the Fitbit app that lets Health Connect users bring their stats over.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/04/02/fitbit-app-health-connect-2/">9to5Google</a>, the Fitbit app is starting to display a "New Health Connect features" card that contains your health and wellness stats. Its arrival lets users set things up by tapping devices (or battery percentage) in the top left corner. From there, you&apos;ll find the new Health Connect card alongside a "set up" button.</p><p>During this process, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-sign-fitbit-premium">Fitbit</a> states that users will be able to sync their fitness data <em>and </em>have the choice to decide which stats carry over. The permissions page lets users select between active calories burned, basal body temperature, and basal metabolic rate statistics. Users can toggle any of these stats to carry over into the Fitbit app or  "allow all" to take everything.</p><p>Unfortunately, users only can track their combined health statistics on their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>. The publication notes that the Google Pixel Watch, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a>, Fitbit watches, and trackers only support Fitbit-based metrics.</p><p>To begin seeing your combined health stats on the "Today" tab, users must first hop into the "You" tab for a new "Records" section. In there, folks should find a settings page letting them decide whether the app should show Fitbit data only or a combination of Fitbit and Health Connect stats.</p><p>That settings page informs that users will see data from both parties, including information about steps, distance, energy burned, and more.</p>

<p>Fitbit&apos;s option to integrate users&apos; Health Connect stats with its app is "slowly" appearing across Android devices. Users should give it some time or even the rest of the week before it appears widely.</p><p>Other news involving Fitbit includes the appearance of a new "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/fitbit-kickstarts-walk-mate-notifications-study">Walk Mate</a>" feature in its app code back in March. It was discovered that these personalized notifications would tailor themselves to fit the individual health needs of the user. The app&apos;s code seemingly spoiled the idea that Fitbit is designing these notifications for folks with an average of 8,000 steps a day or less.</p><p>Also, an updated Fitbit support page detailed the coming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-fitbit-third-party-app-removal-announced">removal of third-party content</a> for its devices for EU residents. Slated to occur in June, users in the EU will lose access to third-party clock faces and apps for a few of Fitbit&apos;s devices. Users have until the removal date to download and install any third-party content they&apos;d like before disappearing for good, leaving behind Google and Fitbit-made apps only.</p>

<ul><li>A dive into Android 14 QPR3 Beta 2.1 shows Google is working on a new "color contrast" settings page to boost app readability.</li><li>The page, tucked inside the beta's code, would let users alter the contrast level of "text, buttons, and icons."</li><li>Android 14 QPR3 Beta 2.1 rolled out yesterday (Apr. 1) and included many bug fixes and solutions for system glitches.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A dive into Android 14&apos;s latest beta seems to show signs of a new settings page that could help boost the readability of apps.</p><p>As spotted by Mishaal Rahman at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2024/04/android-15-color-contrast-settings">Android Headlines</a>, Android 14 QPR3 Beta 2.1 contains a hidden "color contrast" page that lets users alter how text appears on their displays. Google&apos;s description reads, "higher contrast makes text, buttons, and icons stand out more." The page under development gave Rahman a quick preview of how his changes would affect an app.</p><p>It looks like users will be given three options to change: default, medium, and high. Leaving the contrast at "default" lets the Android system express your Material You theme in paler colors as it currently does. However, pushing things to "medium" or even "high" shows how deep and rich the colors become.</p><p>This page includes a second toggleable option that lets users "maximize text contrast." Google states that this button will "add a black or white background around text to increase contrast."</p><p>It&apos;s worth noting that Android supports these changes across its UI in light and dark modes. The settings page warns that users may find that not all apps support "all color and text contrast settings."</p>

<p>Rahman states this new color contrast page could be the final product of an older "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1645448240991547396">contrast levels</a>" slider seen during Android 14 Developer Preview 2 in 2023.</p><p>Those diving into the code of Android 14&apos;s latest beta will be able to surface the new settings, but it remains hidden for the average tester. Rahman states that once it officially rolls out, users will find it under <strong>Settings > Accessibility > Color and Motion</strong>. Speculation suggests this should happen during the arrival of Android 15 later this year.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-qpr3-beta-21-out-now">Android 14 QPR3 Beta 2.1</a> started rolling out to enrolled Pixel testers yesterday (Apr. 1), which included a slew of bug fixes. Many of the bugs Google aimed to squash involved launcher issues, charging and freezing problems, and other system glitches.</p><p>Google revealed its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-second-developer-preview">second developer preview</a> of Android 15 back in March, and with it came a few hints about what&apos;s in store, like satellite connectivity. Most recently, it was discovered that Android 15 will likely hold a long-awaited redesign for its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-volume-panel-redesign-collapsible">volume panel</a>. The new design shows a menu that would spring up from the bottom of your display, bearing large pill-shaped sliders for altering your audio.</p><p>While we await Android 15, April was previously stated to hold the start of its open beta as we approach its full release later this year.</p>

<ul><li>Rumors suggest Sony could keep the same camera hardware for its upcoming Xperia 1 VI.</li><li>Such a move would see the device featuring the same 48MP primary lens, 12MP ultra-wide lens, and 12MP telephoto lens.</li><li>There's speculation that Sony is more interested in boosting the device's image quality, and this could happen because it is leveraging new AI software.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Information is slowly surfacing about Sony&apos;s next flagship, and new rumors suggest some aspects could stay the same.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sumahodigest.com/?p=28702">Smartphone Digest</a> (Japanese), murmurings on Weibo state Sony&apos;s Xperia 1 VI might stick with the same camera tech as the Xperia 1 V (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/sony_xperia_1_vi_may_have_exactly_the_same_cameras_as_its_predecessor-news-62259.php">GSMArena</a>). The upcoming device may continue to feature a 48MP primary lens, a 12MP ultra-wide lens, and a 12MP telephoto lens.</p><p>Rumors add that the device&apos;s primary lens could adopt Sony&apos;s Exmor T sensor for mobile.</p><p>Supposedly, Sony is more concerned with the image quality of its Xperia 1 VI sensors as the company looks to leverage AI software. The publication states this stronger focus could result in the phone&apos;s camera performance in "auto mode."</p><p>The Xperia 1 VI was allegedly spotted receiving its FCC certification, as well. This could mean we&apos;re approaching its official launch, but we&apos;ll have to wait and see.</p><p>Last year&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/sony-xperia-1-v-launch">Xperia 1 V</a> featured the same 48MP, 12MP, and 12MP triple array on its rear panel. A deeper look at the specifications shows that the primary lens features f/1.9 aperture and a 1/1.35" sensor, which is rumored to remain the same.</p><p>What&apos;s more, the Xperia 1 V was launched last year with an Exmor T sensor. This fact confirms speculation that any improvements Sony implements will be due to its internal software.</p>

<p>This second batch of rumors surfaced two weeks after the upcoming Xperia 1 VI was rumored to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/sony-xperai-1-vi-display-aspect-rumors">lose its high-quality display</a>. Also, from Weibo, it was alleged that the device would drop from 4K resolution to 2K Plus. Additionally, a change to its form factor could shift the phone into a shorter and slightly wider design.</p><p>Sony is rumored to move away from its 21:9 aspect ratio in favor of a 19.5:9 setup.</p><p>Moreover, sightings about the phone&apos;s approval of FCC certification might line up with whispers about a May 2024 launch window. The Xperia 1 V launched in May 2023, so it would make sense if Sony did the same thing this year.</p>

It&apos;s an awesome device for streaming content or getting work done on the go, but not everything here is perfect.</p><p>As we describe in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-review">our OnePlus Pad review</a>, the tablet seems to lag occasionally while browsing (something appears to be up with the software) and you can&apos;t expand the storage beyond the 128GB that&apos;s available on the device. Some folks may also take issue with the tablet&apos;s large size, and you&apos;ll need to buy a keyboard separately if you wish to use the Pad like a laptop. Aside from those issues, the OnePlus Pad is an excellent choice if you need something with long-lasting battery life and a vibrant display. And thanks to this 17% discount at Amazon, the tablet is as cheap as it&apos;s ever been.</p>

<p><em>The OnePlus Pad was basically launched as a direct competitor for the Google Pixel Tablet.

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Android users aren&apos;t typically too envious of the iPhone experience, but I think it&apos;s safe to say that MagSafe is a notable exception. Since Apple introduced the magnetic connection and wireless charging standard with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apple-iphone-12-review">iPhone 12</a> series, MagSafe has grown into what is easily the largest accessory ecosystem on the planet. It gets everything right, from simplicity to functionality to compatibility. An accessory you bought for the long-retired iPhone 12 mini will work with the brand-new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15 Pro Max</a> with no problem. </p><p>Luckily, the MagSafe experience is imminent on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>, and that&apos;s thanks to the Qi2 standard. We don&apos;t know which mainstream phone will be the first to launch with Qi2, but it&apos;ll likely come sometime this year. Many were disappointed that Samsung didn&apos;t include Qi2 in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24 series</a> that launched in January. </p><p>If you don&apos;t want to wait, the Peak Design ecosystem brings the MagSafe experience to Android phones today. As a longtime MagSafe user, I spent a few weeks using magnetic accessories provided by Peak Design on my iPhones and Android smartphones. With as little as one Peak Design phone case, your phone can tap into the expansive MagSafe ecosystem of accessories. If this is what the future of Qi2 on Android holds, I&apos;m excited about it. </p>
<h2 id="what-the-future-of-accessory-compatibility-holds-2">What the future of accessory compatibility holds</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4535px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FUJjixzaeqRyK5Y62c7wM7" name="Peak-Design-Case-MagSafe-Charger-Comparison.jpg" alt="An iPhone and an Android phone using MagSafe chargers." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FUJjixzaeqRyK5Y62c7wM7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4535" height="2551" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Late in 2023, the Wireless Power Consortium <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.chargewithqi.com/resources/qi2-the-new-qi2-standard-for-wireless-devices/" target="_blank">announced</a> that the Qi2 standard was ready to be included on new devices. There are a handful of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-wireless-charging-standard">benefits to the Qi2</a> standard, like 15W wireless charging as opposed to 5W speeds using regular Qi. And since devices must be certified by the WPC in order to use the Qi2 name and branding, you&apos;ll be certain that chargers and accessories will work with your phone. </p><p>However, the bigger part of Qi2 has little to do with charging. The standard includes support for the Magnetic Power Profile, and this is partially derived from Apple&apos;s own MagSafe tech. Qi2 includes a ring of magnets that&apos;ll help your phone align perfectly with a wireless charger&apos;s coils, which increases charging efficiency. More importantly, the Qi2 standard&apos;s magnet ring is interoperable with MagSafe. A future is shaping up where you&apos;ll be able to buy Qi2 or MagSafe accessories and use them with basically any new phone you can find.</p>
<h2 id="the-peak-design-ecosystem-is-a-solution-for-today-2">The Peak Design ecosystem is a solution for today</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4535px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="p9YxwTozKkmFdJW6KhxEFL" name="Peak-Design-SlimLink.jpg" alt="The SlimLink connector on a Peak Design Everyday Case." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p9YxwTozKkmFdJW6KhxEFL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4535" height="2551" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are a surprising number of ways to get MagSafe to work with your Android phone in 2024. Some cases include built-in MagSafe rings, or you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/consider-adding-magsafe-adapter-for-android">slap a MagSafe ring sticker on any phone</a> or case of your choosing. To me, using a Peak Design Everyday Case is one of the better options. There are Everyday Case options for all the biggest Android phone models, and they have more features than just MagSafe compatibility. In fact, Peak Design includes its own SlimLink connection standard as an alternative to MagSafe on the Everyday Case. </p><p>What separates Peak Design&apos;s ecosystem from all the other ways of getting MagSafe on Android is that it feels official. Things like magnetic sticker rings and cheap MagSafe phone cases often feel like hacky solutions rather than polished ones. By comparison, it&apos;s impossible to see that the Everyday Case supports MagSafe just by looking at it. Aside from the SlimLink mounting point, the Everyday Case looks just like any other premium case with a canvas exterior and plastic frame. </p><p>Completing the experience is a wide variety of first-party accessories that compare with Apple&apos;s own official <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phones">MagSafe accessories</a>. For example, the Peak Design Mobile Wallet is like an Apple MagSafe Wallet, but better. I&apos;m on my third leather MagSafe Wallet from Apple, and I have had two replaced under warranty because they literally fell apart. So far, the Mobile Wallet seems better than the MagSafe Wallet in a number of ways. It also matches the Everyday Case in the same way that a leather MagSafe wallet matches Apple&apos;s official leather iPhone case.</p>

<p>However, the best part of using the Peak Design Everyday Case is that you can use it with non-Peak Design accessories. I&apos;ve used my Mobile Wallet with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15 Pro Max</a>, which I use without a case. I&apos;ve also used an official Apple MagSafe charger with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7a-review">Pixel 7a</a> through an Everyday Case. With these accessories, you can use the same great products with iPhones <em>and</em> Android phones. Considering that accessory makers consistently put more effort into creating products for iPhones, interoperability is a huge win for Android users.</p>
<h2 id="it-apos-s-only-going-to-get-better-with-qi2-2">It&apos;s only going to get better with Qi2</h2>

<p>By simply putting a Peak Design case on my Android phone, I&apos;ve been able to replicate the MagSafe experience. However, even a case won&apos;t be required for this kind of functionality in the not-so-distant future. When Android phones start shipping with Qi2, the accessory market will gain some much-needed parity between the iPhone and Android markets. If my time using Peak Design accessories is any indication, the future of smartphones with Qi2 looks bright. </p>

<ul><li>Google published a research paper about a new generative AI model for weather forecasting called Scalable Ensemble Envelope Diffusion Sampler (SEEDS). </li><li>Weather forecasting can be expensive, especially when highly trained AI models and supercomputers are involved, and that's where SEEDS comes into play.</li><li>Right now, Google's weather-forecasting AI models are comparable in accuracy to other methods, but they are much more efficient and cost-effective.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Even with detailed weather information in the palm of our hands, thanks to our smartphones, the weather consistently surprises us. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-weather-ui-redesign-phone-rollout">Weather</a> forecasting won&apos;t ever be perfect, but there may be room for it to improve, thanks to emerging technology. Using fancy artificial intelligence models and supercomputers seems like an obvious solution, but those options come with high costs. However, Google thinks it can make medium-range weather forecasting more efficient with generative artificial intelligence. </p><p>Google recently published a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adk4489" target="_blank">report</a> and subsequent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.research.google/2024/03/generative-ai-to-quantify-uncertainty.html" target="_blank">blog post</a> on SEEDS, an AI model that stands for Scalable Ensemble Envelope Diffusion Sampler (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-seeds-weather-forecast-ai-prediction/" target="_blank">Android Police</a>). The company cites the problem with current methods for weather forecasting, such as physics-based simulation. While accurate, physics-based simulation becomes incredibly expensive at a large scale. </p><p>By comparison, Google says that SEEDS can "efficiently generate ensembles of weather forecasts <em>at scale </em>at a small fraction of the cost of traditional physics-based forecasting models."</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Introducing SEEDS, our newest generative AI technology that advances medium-range weather forecasting. We can now generate ensemble forecasts more efficiently, helping us better predict rare and extreme weather events. 🌩️ #WeatherForecasting Learn more at https://t.co/wcVXjpS1dx pic.twitter.com/iLOEWVZelS<a href="https://twitter.com/GoogleAI/status/1773774362413355099">March 29, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>As they currently stand, AI models are not more accurate than other weather forecasting methods, but they are comparable. In the future, models like SEEDS could grow to be more accurate than physics-based models. However, a more realistic future could see a mix of physics-based models and generative AI models used to balance accuracy, efficiency, and scalability. </p><p>"SEEDS leverages the power of generative AI to produce ensemble forecasts comparable to those from the operational U.S. forecast system, but at an accelerated pace," Google says. "The results reported in this paper need only 2 seeding forecasts from the operational system, which generates 31 forecasts in its current version."</p><p>Google thinks that the increased efficiency of generative AI could allow weather reporting institutions to invest in forecasting in different ways. If a model like SEEDS could take a few physics-based models and turn them into a multitude of weather distributions, the money and resources saved from using fewer traditional simulations could fund a greater number of forecasts released more often. Alternatively, Google says the extra resources could be used to create more detailed physics-based models. </p><p>The SEEDS model joins MetNet-3 and GraphCast as Google&apos;s newest weather-related technologies. Whether or not SEEDS ever powers a consumer-grade product, it&apos;s cool to see use cases for AI outside of chatbots and image generators.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung Galaxy phones released in 2020 received their last monthly update with the March 2024 security patch. </li><li>From now on, the Galaxy S20 series will get quarterly software updates until support is completely dropped. </li><li>The specific smartphone models affected are the Galaxy S20, Galaxy S20 Plus, Galaxy S20 Ultra, Galaxy S20 FE, Galaxy Note 20, and Galaxy Note 20 Ultra.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung made waves when it decided to extend software support for a handful of older devices a few years ago and more recently when it promised seven years of support for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24 series</a>. However, through all of this, the Galaxy S20 series has been left out. The company&apos;s smartphones released in 2020 did not get the operating system upgrade to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>, and now, its run of monthly software updates has ended. </p><p>As <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s20-quarterly-updates-3430310/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> first reported, the Galaxy S20 series is no longer eligible for monthly updates and will receive them on a quarterly basis instead. Owners of the Galaxy S20, Galaxy S20 Plus, Galaxy S20 Ultra, Galaxy S20 FE, Galaxy Note 20, and Galaxy Note 20 Ultra — all released in 2020 — should now expect updates four times a year, usually every three months. Following a lack of support for Android 14, the switch to quarterly updates is the latest step toward obsolescence for the four-year-old smartphone lineup. </p><p>While it might be disappointing to lose support for monthly security updates, this was somewhat expected. Samsung promised three years of OS upgrades for the Galaxy S20 series, which originally shipped with Android 10. After getting the bump to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-13-review">Android 13</a> in 2022, Samsung&apos;s original promise was met. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DJghtKahdF46jXTqP7Wp8k" name="ringtone-picker-samsung-galaxy-s20-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Ringtones picker on the Samsung Galaxy S20 kept on a red couch." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DJghtKahdF46jXTqP7Wp8k.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That means the last monthly update to reach Galaxy S20 smartphones is the March 2024 update. All the fixes in the April 2024 update won&apos;t hit this lineup of phones until the next quarterly update, which is slated for June 2024. Interestingly, the Galaxy 20 series will be supported for a total of five years with security updates — albeit less frequently — which exceeds Samsung&apos;s original promise.</p><p>Although the Samsung Galaxy S20 series won&apos;t have access to the April 2024 security update, it has already started reaching other devices. Samsung&apos;s Galaxy S24 series <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/some-samsung-devices-are-already-getting-the-april-update-with-camera-improvements" target="_blank">started seeing the April 2024 patch</a> last week, and it included more than just bug fixes. Aside from those improvements, the April 2024 update featured support for 480p resolution with Instant Slow-Mo videos.</p><p>Fortunately, users who upgrade to the Galaxy S24 series can take advantage of seven years of software support, and that&apos;ll probably outlast the phone&apos;s hardware.</p>

So when Xiaomi announced that it was ready to roll out the Xiaomi 14 Ultra, I was immediately excited.</p><p>That said, I had my misgivings; 2024 has been a terrific year for phone cameras, with the Honor Magic 6 Pro and Find X7 Ultra setting a very high standard. I wasn&apos;t sure how Xiaomi would match these devices — much less beat them — but then I started using the Xiaomi 14 Ultra, and it was a revelation.</p><p>You need to use the Xiaomi 14 Ultra for just a few minutes to realize that it is magnificent. I used a lot of phones this year, and the Xiaomi 14 Ultra is the one that stands out the most. It just has that little bit extra that turns a great phone into something truly special.</p>

<p>Xiaomi unveiled the Xiaomi 14 Ultra at Mobile World Congress 2024, and the device made its global debut shortly at a launch event in India on March 7. It went on general availability starting March 14, and it is now available in the U.K. and other global markets.</p><p>Xiaomi is selling a single version of the Xiaomi 14 Ultra globally, and it comes with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. The phone costs £1,299 ($1,640) in the U.K., and all orders include the Xiaomi Pad 6 as well as the Xiaomi 14 Ultra Professional Kit — a £300 value. The Xiaomi 14 Ultra costs €1,499 ($1,620) in Germany and other parts of the region, and while all orders come with the Xiaomi 14 Ultra Professional Kit as standard, buyers outside the U.K. don&apos;t get the Xiaomi Pad 6.</p><p>Xiaomi is doing things differently in India, where the Xiaomi 14 Ultra is available for ₹99,999 ($1,199). That&apos;s considerably lower than what the device retails for in most regions, and you get the same 16GB/512GB version. Xiaomi India isn&apos;t bundling anything with the device, but the fact that it&apos;s so affordable makes it a much better choice than in any other region.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rVsa5tGkkr9zRBkfVzgVoH" name="xiaomi14-ultra-27.jpg" alt="Xiaomi 14 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rVsa5tGkkr9zRBkfVzgVoH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-13-ultra-global-review">Xiaomi 13 Ultra</a> got a lot right last year, but the camera island was massive, and it sat on a raised platform that made using the phone without a case annoying. While Xiaomi retained the same broad design, it made several tweaks that make holding and using the Xiaomi 14 Ultra that much easier.</p>
<p>Like previous years, the Xiaomi 14 Ultra has no design similarities to the rest of its siblings; the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-review">Xiaomi 14</a> has an entirely different aesthetic, and it isn&apos;t evident that both phones are in the same series. Having said that, I think the Xiaomi 14 Ultra is one of the best-looking phones Xiaomi released in recent years, and the white variant in particular is stunning.</p>
<p>You still get a leather back, and it now covers the entire width of the phone. Just like last year, the mid-frame extends to the back where it merges seamlessly with the leather, and it looks rather cool. Xiaomi uses an aluminum mid-frame in global models of the Xiaomi 14 Ultra, and I was keen on using the titanium version of the device to see how it would hold up against the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15 Pro Max</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, but it is limited to China.</p>

<p>The camera housing at the back is nearly unchanged from last year, and the only difference is that it is even larger. You still get a gold accent that encircles the housing, and the sheer size makes it stand out visually. Having used the Xiaomi 13 Ultra extensively, the Xiaomi 14 Ultra has a much better in-hand feel; the device is a smidgen shorter and wider than its predecessor, and that is noticeable when using both phones next to each other.</p>
<p>The power and volume buttons are on the right, and the fingerprint sensor is optimally located on the screen where it can be easily accessed by your thumb when using the phone one-handed. A lot of manufacturers position the module lower on the screen, but that thankfully isn&apos;t an issue on this phone.</p>
<p>Talking about non-issues, the Xiaomi 14 Ultra has IP68 ingress protection, giving it the same level of resilience as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">best Samsung phones</a> — it&apos;s good to see Xiaomi continuing to offer this feature as standard on its high-end devices.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="YuSyfgGwkSG36gZbzTvq9A" name="xiaomi14-ultra-1.jpg" alt="Xiaomi 14 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YuSyfgGwkSG36gZbzTvq9A.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Xiaomi 14 Ultra has the same 6.73-inch AMOLED panel as last year and retains Dolby Vision and HDR10+. The only meaningful difference in this area is that the screen goes up to 3,000 nits in HDR content, and while it tends to get marginally brighter than its predecessor in daily use, it isn&apos;t noticeable unless you&apos;re using both devices side-by-side.</p>
<p>While there isn&apos;t much in the way of an upgrade, the screen has plenty going for it; the LTPO tech ensures the dynamic refresh goes down to 1Hz when viewing static content, you get a great selection of always-on styles, and there&apos;s a lot of customizability in general. You can adjust the color balance, change the color gamut, and tweak just about everything to do with the panel.</p>

<p>Xiaomi does a great job with color calibration in general, and while the Xiaomi 14 Ultra doesn&apos;t quite hit the insane brightness levels posted by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-review">Magic 6 Pro</a>, the AMOLED panel has standout colors and contrast levels and it&apos;s outstanding in daily use. I didn&apos;t see any issues while streaming content or playing games on the device, and the stereo sound is among the best phone of any phone I tested in 2024.</p>
<p>The one area where things are different is screen protection; Xiaomi is using its own in-house glass layer in lieu of Corning&apos;s Gorilla Glass, with the brand noting that it offers much better shatter resistance. I put that to the test (unwittingly, as always) when the device slid down the nightstand and fell to the floor, and thankfully there was no damage.</p>

<p>Like its rivals, the Xiaomi 14 Ultra is powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a>, and it has all the additional features you&apos;d want in a high-end device. Xiaomi is making a single variant of the phone available in global markets, and it comes with 16GB of LPDDR5X RAM and 512GB of UFS 4.0 storage. I would have liked to see the 1TB model making its global debut, but like other Chinese brands, Xiaomi is limiting that variant to its home market.</p><p>The phone has no slowdowns or lag whatsoever in daily use, and while Xiaomi didn&apos;t introduce many new software features, it made system stability a priority.</p>

<p>Xiaomi intentionally blocks access to 3DMark on its devices, but surprisingly enough, that isn&apos;t the case on the Xiaomi 14 Ultra — I was able to launch the utility and run the usual tests. It&apos;s clear that Xiaomi set conservative thermal limits on the device, as it didn&apos;t get close to the likes of the Zenfone 11 and Magic 6 Pro in a lot of synthetic workloads.</p>
<p>Also, while running the 3DMark Solar Bay stress test, the device got so hot that it effectively shut down. A large Device Overheated message showed up on the screen, and it shut down the radios and went into hibernation. I didn&apos;t run into this particular issue on any device in several years — Sony&apos;s phones were prone to hit their thermal limit often — but it&apos;s no wonder that Xiaomi is being aggressive.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ErLaKfoq62qv89W7K9ewjD" name="xiaomi14-ultra-24.jpg" alt="Xiaomi 14 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ErLaKfoq62qv89W7K9ewjD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, the device doesn&apos;t overheat in regular use, and while it tends to get hot after extended gaming sessions, it isn&apos;t uncomfortable to hold.</p>
<p>Xiaomi is known to deliver a good hardware package, and it didn&apos;t leave anything out here; the Xiaomi 14 Ultra includes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/wi-fi-7-explained">Wi-Fi 7</a>, Bluetooth 5.4, global Sub-6 5G bands, NFC, the entire suite of AptX audio codecs, and USB-C 3.2 with DisplayPort, allowing you to mirror the device to an external monitor.</p><p>The vibration motor is fantastic as well, delivering exquisite feedback when using the keyboard and navigating the interface. I didn&apos;t see any issues with connectivity or the rest of the radios, and the Xiaomi 14 Ultra is one of the most feature-rich phones you can get today.</p>

<p>Xiaomi isn&apos;t changing anything around the battery, and the Xiaomi 14 Ultra has the same 5,000mAh battery as its predecessor. You get the same 90W charging tech as well, and it takes just over 35 minutes to charge the battery. What I like about Xiaomi&apos;s charging tech is that it uses the USB PD 3.0 standard, and the bundled 90W charger is great at charging a whole host of other devices in addition to the phone.</p><p>Xiaomi also offers wireless charging on the device, and it goes up to 80W. That said, the brand doesn&apos;t sell its wireless charger in most countries, and it goes down to 15W when using a regular Qi charging mat.</p><p>Thanks to the large battery, the Xiaomi 14 Ultra manages to last well over a day without any issues whatsoever. It lasts a little longer than its predecessor, and even with heavy use, it delivers over a day&apos;s worth of power consistently. To be honest, battery anxiety really isn&apos;t a thing in 2024, and with most high-end phones offering 5000mAh or larger batteries, you&apos;re guaranteed to get a day&apos;s worth of use without any hassle.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="potncUtAozcxRPiVDU4MC8" name="xiaomi14-ultra-4.jpg" alt="Xiaomi 14 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/potncUtAozcxRPiVDU4MC8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Xiaomi 13 Ultra had the best cameras of any phone I tested in 2023, so I was keen to take a look at what the Xiaomi 14 Ultra has to offer in this area. Thankfully, Xiaomi hasn&apos;t made too many changes in this area — the phone has quad 50MP cameras this time as well — and the Xiaomi 14 Ultra retains a lot of the same great features that made its predecessor stand out.</p><p>The main camera is a 1-inch 50MP Sony LYT-900 module, and the key talking point is that it uses variable aperture, going from f/1.6 all the way to f/4.0. There&apos;s limited adjustability in auto mode, but the Pro mode unlocks the full potential of the module. You get a 50MP wide-angle lens that uses a Sony IMX858 module, and two 50MP telephoto lenses, one that goes up to 3.2x optical zoom and the other up to 5x.</p><p>Xiaomi isn&apos;t the only manufacturer offering two telephoto modules, with the Find X7 Ultra also going this route. There&apos;s OIS on three of the lenses (the wide-angle misses out), and at the front Xiaomi offers a 32MP camera — identical to last year.</p><p>The Leica partnership brings a slate of shooting modes and effects, and you&apos;ll need to pick between Leica Vibrant and Leica Authentic modes for stills — I prefer to use the Vibrant mode as it delivers better colors. There are more shooting modes than you&apos;ll end up using, and Xiaomi didn&apos;t leave anything out. </p>

<p>The Xiaomi 14 Ultra takes fantastic photos in daylight conditions, delivering excellent dynamic range, color vibrancy, and rendition. I don&apos;t have anything to fault with the camera in daylight scenarios, and the wide-angle lens does a good job serving up a similar caliber of shots as the main lens.</p><p>Where the phone truly comes into its own is portrait shots; I got better images out of the Xiaomi 14 Ultra than my mirrorless, and this is the biggest reason why I use the device. It also does a great job with moving subjects; we have a nine-month-old who doesn&apos;t sit still for more than a few seconds, and the Xiaomi 14 Ultra is able to keep up with her.</p><p>I haven&apos;t used the telephoto lenses all that much, but they are better than last year — even though Xiaomi is using the same camera modules. Tweaks to its camera tuning means you get better detail at 3.2x and 5x, and what&apos;s evident this year is how good the shots are at up to 10x and even beyond.</p><p>The Xiaomi 14 Ultra excels in low-light scenarios, and even with little to no ambient light, the phone somehow manages to deliver usable shots. I&apos;ve always maintained that Google makes the best cameras, but that hasn&apos;t been the case for over a year now, and the Xiaomi 14 Ultra extends Xiaomi&apos;s lead in this area.</p><p>The Xiaomi 14 Ultra is leagues ahead of the Galaxy S24 Ultra and even edges out the Honor Magic 6 Pro in most scenarios. I think its biggest rival is the Find X7 Ultra, but with that phone limited to China, Xiaomi doesn&apos;t really have a contender that delivers the same caliber of photos and videos. If you take a lot of photos and videos, the Xiaomi 14 Ultra is the best phone of 2024.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-xiaomi-14-ultra-software"><span>Xiaomi 14 Ultra: Software</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="G9uWuayDTVJvEXaQv3TxGH" name="xiaomi14-ultra-17.jpg" alt="Xiaomi 14 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/G9uWuayDTVJvEXaQv3TxGH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Xiaomi made a big deal of its software overhaul, and at the outset, there isn&apos;t anything noticeably different. HyperOS 1.0 is based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>, and in a lot of ways, it is virtually indistinguishable from MIUI 14. In fact, the Xiaomi 14 Ultra doesn&apos;t have any meaningful new additions on the software side of things.</p>
<p>While the software may not have any groundbreaking features, it is fluid like no other Xiaomi phone. This is true with the standard Xiaomi 14 as well, and the brand deserves credit for finally optimizing its software so that it runs fluidly on Qualcomm&apos;s high-end hardware. The difference is noticeable against the Xiaomi 13 Ultra, and it makes using the device that much more enjoyable.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rr2G9BixYm9oRYFtDhgMPE" name="xiaomi14-ultra-18.jpg" alt="Xiaomi 14 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rr2G9BixYm9oRYFtDhgMPE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, there are a few frustrations — as is always the case with Xiaomi. The brand has offered a Control Center-style split notification pane for over three years now, but it was always optional; that isn&apos;t the case now. There is no way to get a unified notification pane with toggles and notifications in the same window, and that&apos;s irksome.</p>
<p>But what particularly bothers me is that the toggles section doesn&apos;t have any text labels. This makes it highly annoying to use, and it always took a lot longer to pull up a setting — whether it&apos;s launching Tailscale, accessing Bitwarden, or just toggling the flashlight — than on any other phone. I don&apos;t know what Xiaomi was trying to achieve here, but if the goal was to make the notification pane harder to use, it succeeded.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="oHeu2QTnqAJV4emHKkVwpE" name="xiaomi14-ultra-23.jpg" alt="Xiaomi 14 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oHeu2QTnqAJV4emHKkVwpE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As for the notification section, a pull-down on a notification doesn&apos;t reveal additional details — you&apos;ll need to use the arrow down button that&apos;s located to the right. This is different to how Google, Samsung, and ASUS do things, and I don&apos;t understand why Xiaomi couldn&apos;t have retained the same system as MIUI 14.</p>
<p>But that&apos;s my only quibble with the software. I still think that Xiaomi&apos;s software is in need of a visual overhaul; ColorOS does a better job integrating Material You with a unique visual aesthetic. The only customization feature that&apos;s new is the ability to change the look of the lock screen, and it is nearly identical to what you get in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-6">One UI 6</a>. </p><p>When it comes to software updates, Xiaomi guarantees four platform updates along with five years of security updates. That&apos;s in line with what other Chinese brands offer, but I&apos;m not convinced that Xiaomi can deliver software updates on time. That may change in the coming months, but until now, Xiaomi was the last of the major Chinese manufacturers to deliver platform updates to its phones.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="paYxFADwQuqdWLubvkhEmG" name="xiaomi14-ultra-30.jpg" alt="Xiaomi 14 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/paYxFADwQuqdWLubvkhEmG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Honor&apos;s Magic 6 Pro comes close to the Xiaomi 14 Ultra when it comes to the cameras, and the phone is available globally. The phone has a brighter screen and lasts longer, and while its zoom lens isn&apos;t as versatile as the Xiaomi 14 Ultra, the main camera and wide-angle lenses take amazing shots in just about any scenario. And at £1,099, it is £200 less than what the Xiaomi 14 Ultra costs in the U.K.</p><p>I like the Find X7 Ultra quite a bit as well, and if anything, it takes slightly better portrait shots than the Xiaomi 14 Ultra — no small feat. However, the device is limited to China, and there are so many issues with the software that I&apos;m not going to recommend it.</p><p>The Galaxy S24 Ultra inevitably gets a mention because it is the default choice in most countries, but Samsung has played it too safe this year — to the detriment of the device. The Galaxy S24 Ultra has all the extras you need, and the phone feels great to hold and use. While the camera modules haven&apos;t changed, Samsung made plenty of tweaks to its algorithms to deliver better photos, but the phone doesn&apos;t measure up to the Xiaomi 14 Ultra in challenging scenarios.</p>

<ul><li>You need the best value</li></ul>
<p>Xiaomi got a lot right with its phone strategy in 2024. The Xiaomi 14 is a fantastic device that combines high-end internals and standout cameras in a chassis that&apos;s smaller than its rivals, and I liked using the device so much that I didn&apos;t switch out well past the review window.</p><p>The Xiaomi 14 Ultra is in a league of its own. I&apos;m not exaggerating when I say that this is my favorite phone of 2024; I got close to 30 devices this year — including all the flagships — and it has a better in-hand feel than just about any other phone. But that&apos;s not why I like the phone so much — it&apos;s the cameras that truly differentiate the Xiaomi 14 Ultra from the rest of the pack.</p><p>The Find X7 Ultra and Magic 6 Pro come close to what Xiaomi is offering this year, but the Xiaomi 14 Ultra still has a slender edge when it comes to photos, and it handily beats the Galaxy S24 Ultra and Pixel 8 Pro. It&apos;s great to see Xiaomi bringing the device to additional markets this year, and its launch in India is a pivotal moment as the brand tries to change the status quo.</p><p>Xiaomi has been making flagships for the better part of a decade now, and the Xiaomi 14 Ultra is proof that the Chinese manufacturer can outshine the best that this segment has to offer.</p>

<ul><li>Users can now use ChatGPT without signing up for an account, aligning with OpenAI's goal of broad accessibility for AI tools.</li><li>Not needing an account allows OpenAI to gather more training data, potentially improving AI models.</li><li>While ChatGPT is available without an account, signing up is required for access to paid services and features like DALL-E.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>If you&apos;ve been hesitant about sharing personal information to chat with ChatGPT, OpenAI is now removing that hurdle for you.</p><p>OpenAI&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chatgpt-code-suggests-default-assistant-android">free AI platform, ChatGPT,</a> won&apos;t require you to sign up anymore, the company said in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://openai.com/blog/start-using-chatgpt-instantly" target="_blank">blog post</a>. The goal is to make AI tools like ChatGPT accessible to everyone, so now you can jump right in without the hassle of creating an account.</p><p>If you&apos;re cool with it, not needing an account means OpenAI gets more training data. It might also encourage more people to sign up and subscribe for even better access to GPT-4 instead of sticking with the older GPT-3.5 model that free users usually get.</p><p>"We may use what you provide to ChatGPT to improve our models for everyone," OpenAI said.</p><p>But if you&apos;re wary about the whole model training thing, you can still opt out, even without an account. Just click on the little question mark on the right side of the text box, then hit <em>Settings</em>, and flip the switch for "Improve the model for everyone" to off.</p><p>Since ChatGPT debuted back in late 2022, people who wanted to dive in had to make an OpenAI account. Then, OpenAI started offering paid subscriptions to unlock more powerful services like DALL-E 3.</p><p>While OpenAI is letting anyone use its AI chatbot without needing an account, you&apos;ll still need to sign up if you&apos;re eyeing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/companies-charging-consumers-ai-subscriptions">paid services like DALL-E</a>. Opting for the GPT-4 subscription redirects you to the service&apos;s signup page.</p><p>To save and review chat history, share chats, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chatgpt-with-voice-free-users-rollout">have voice conversations</a>, you&apos;ll also need to have an account.</p><p>OpenAI said it&apos;s beefed up protections for users without accounts, like restricting prompts and image generations in certain categories. However, the company hasn&apos;t explained what these categories are.</p><p>If you&apos;re intrigued by ChatGPT, this could be a neat way to test it out without handing over too much of your information.</p>

<p>This year, Motorola finally began to simplify its confusing Moto G lineup of phones. The Moto G 5G ($199) and Moto G Power ($299) sit between the Moto G Play ($149) and the Moto G Stylus ($399) and offer compelling budget-friendly options for buyers looking for a new smartphone in 2024.</p><p>But is it really worth spending an extra $100 on the Moto G Power 2024, or should you save the cash and buy a Moto G 5G 2024 instead? Our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-5g-2024-review">Moto G 5G 2024 review</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-power-5g-2024-review">Moto G Power 5G 2024 review</a> go in-depth for each option, but we&apos;re going to take a high-level look at what&apos;s different between the two and why you might want to consider one over the other.</p>

<p>Both the Moto G 5G 2024 and Moto G Power 5G 2024 feature vegan leather exteriors, something <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-vegan-leather-phones">I praised Motorola for</a> when the phones debuted. Vegan leather feels so much better than a flat plastic back, as it&apos;s made of a durable polyurethane resin that&apos;s fabricated to look and feel similar to animal leather.</p><p>Neither phone scratches very easily and I wasn&apos;t able to make any obvious marks with my fingernail or a car key, so this is actually quite durable. Plus, both phones are water-repellant, which means neither are suitable for taking a bath with but will do just fine in a rain storm.</p>

<p>Motorola offers a rather attractive Pale Lilac colorway for the Moto G Power 5G 2024, while the Moto G 5G 2024 only comes in "Sage Green." I use quotes there because I was actually surprised to see this referred to as Sage Green. In reality, it looks more like a navy blue to me. It&apos;s not a bad color, but it&apos;s certainly not as fun as Pale Lilac.</p><p>Beyond that, both phones feature a plastic frame and buttons, plus some noticeable bezels up front. From the pictures below, you&apos;d be hard-pressed to tell the difference between the two.</p>
<div class="inlinegallery  inline-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xB33HoBhXQ6mUZ7BgTeXgc" name="Moto-G-Power-5G-2024-review-13.jpg" alt="The Moto G Power 5G 2024 home screen indoors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xB33HoBhXQ6mUZ7BgTeXgc.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CvqPXMRFKhjf7ht7pHM3kW" name="Moto-G-5G-2024-display.jpg" alt="The display of the Moto G 5G 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CvqPXMRFKhjf7ht7pHM3kW.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div>
<p>The real difference comes when using the two phones side-by-side, as you&apos;ll immediately notice how crisper and sharper the Moto G Power 5G&apos;s display is. That&apos;s because it has 1,431,360 more pixels than the Moto G 5G&apos;s display has — that&apos;s more than 2x the pixel density! If you&apos;re someone who plans to watch HD videos on their phone, the Moto G Power 5G&apos;s display will look a lot better.</p><p>On the bright side, if you opt for the less expensive Moto G 5G 2024, you&apos;ll still be getting a smooth 120Hz display that looks good.</p><p>It&apos;s also worth noting that neither phone uses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a>, which is a good thing for anyone sensitive to light flicker and makes both of these phones preferable over <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phones</a> at the same price.</p>

<p>Because the display is so much more pixel-dense, Motorola had to put a more powerful processor inside the Moto G Power 5G 2024 compared to the Moto G 5G 2024. Surprisingly, though, it&apos;s only about 10% faster in benchmark applications.</p><p>Unfortunately, neither phone runs games particularly well, and you&apos;ll find that playing popular games like Honkai: Star Rail or Fortnite is basically impossible here. You can get them running on it but neither phone will offer a smooth experience.</p>

<p>Thankfully, most other applications run just fine on both devices. We&apos;ve seen Motorola devices struggle to offer smooth performance on high refresh rate displays in the past, but both Moto G 5G and Moto G Power 5G phones keep up a consistent refresh rate while using popular apps. In other words, all the most basic tasks will work just fine on both phones.</p><p>However, if you&apos;re someone who finds themself switching between multiple apps every time you pick up your phone, you&apos;d best stick with the Moto G Power 5G. That&apos;s because it doubles the amount of RAM that&apos;s in the Moto G 5G, providing an ample 8GB of RAM. The Moto G 5G 2024&apos;s 4GB of RAM is quite small in 2024 when one app might take a few gigs just for itself.</p><p>Motorola offers a "RAM boost" feature that&apos;s enabled out of the box, but I&apos;d recommend turning this off no matter which phone you use. While it&apos;s advertised to virtually increase RAM and provide better performance, I found that the opposite was true. Apps were regularly unstable, and the phone would have a harder time switching between apps when I had this feature enabled.</p>

<p>If the camera is the most important part of a smartphone, I would recommend not buying <em>either</em> of these phones. Instead, take a look at a great <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-6a-preorders-and-release-date-how-to-buy-the-budget-phone">Google Pixel 6a deal</a>, instead. The phone is often on sale for $299 or less and offers a substantially better camera than Motorola&apos;s offerings here.</p><p>But if you&apos;d rather stick with Motorola, the Moto G Power 5G offers a better experience overall. While the main camera on both Moto G 5G and Moto G Power 5G capture similar quality photos, it&apos;s the other two cameras that get the real upgrade.</p>

<p>Motorola stuck a useless 2MP "macro camera" on the Moto G 5G 2024 that takes truly awful pictures in any light. Meanwhile, the Moto G Power 5G 2024 sports an 8MP ultrawide camera that&apos;s really not half bad.</p><p>Likewise, the front-facing camera on the Moto G 5G 2024 takes extremely soft photos, even in broad daylight. The Moto G Power 5G 2024&apos;s front-facing camera is double the resolution and looks it in every shot.</p>

<p>While the Moto G Power 5G 2024&apos;s processor is only marginally better than the one in the Moto G 5G 2024, the rest of the package is a pretty noticeable upgrade. The display is more than double the resolution, and Motorola even doubled the RAM on the phone. That means multitasking is substantially better on the Moto G Power than the Moto G 5G.</p><p>Not only that, but the Moto G 5G&apos;s macro camera is entirely useless, while the Moto G Power swaps that camera out for a far more useful 8MP ultrawide one. Plus, selfies just look better on the G Power, thanks to the upgraded front-facing sensor.</p><p>In short, if you just need a basic phone that&apos;s got great design and lets you effortlessly browse social networks and communicate with friends, the Moto G 5G 2024 is a great pick. Otherwise, the Moto G Power 5G 2024 does everything else better.</p>
