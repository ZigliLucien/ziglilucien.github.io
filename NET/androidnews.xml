<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/happy-birthday-youtube-20/">YouTube turned 20</a> this week and celebrating its two decade milestone, the streaming platform shared some fun facts about its inception along with latest features that are being testing and coming to users soon.</p><p>What began as a 19-second video back in 2005 has now evolved into a full-blown streaming giant, with over 20 million video uploads each day. YouTube has also become a hub for people to have conversations and comment, and react to all sorts of videos, whether they like it or not. According to the streaming platform, "in 2024, YouTube users averaged over 100 million comments on videos daily. And we discovered that last year, creators received comments from an average of 10 million viewers every day.”</p>

<p>That said, YouTube seems to be giving back to its avid users as well. In its blog post, YouTube said that in a few weeks, YouTube TV users can test out multiviews on their account. They can build their personalized multi-view window that showcases non-sports channels as well. Considering that YouTube is testing this feature out, YouTube says that it is starting "with a small group of popular channels and expanding in the coming months."</p><p>For its Premium users, the streaming platform is immediately rolling out 4x playback speed on mobile devices. This was being tested out in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-new-experimental-features-4x-speeds-and-jump-ahead">February</a> and has now finally landed.  More creators will have the ability to voice-respond to comments on their videos.</p><p>Furthermore, users can start creating their personalized radio station with the AI-powered tool called "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube/youtube-musics-personalized-radio-stations-are-getting-even-smarter">Ask Music</a>". You can speak or ask YouTube to create a playlist for you with "upbeat songs for a morning run," "calm jazz for studying," "80s-inspired indie," or even something more specific to your mood. Ask Music is available on iOS and Android for all YouTube Premium and YouTube Music users.</p>

<p>Lastly, the YouTube TV app is getting a full redesign this summer, the blog post added."Easier navigation, playback, quality tweaks, plus streamlined access to comments, channel info, and subscribing are heading to your screens," YouTube stated.</p><p>The company shared a quick glimpse of what the new UI would look like, featuring video from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/LofiGirl">@LoFiGirl. </a>The controls on the new UI are more spread out when compared to the current version. The channel, description, and subscribe buttons are on the left, the play/pause and next controls are in the center, making it more accessible and prominent. While the other controls, like settings and the like/dislike toggles, remain on the left of the screen, as seen above.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-search-labs-english-speaking-practice-ai-experiment">Google's Search</a> also saw gained $50.7 billion in revenue this quarter which is up from $46.16 billion in 2024. "Search saw continued strong growth, boosted by the engagement we’re seeing with features like AI Overviews, which now has 1.5 billion users per month."</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-googles-anthos-cross-platform-cloud-strategy-threat-microsoft-azure">Google Cloud</a> also took the spotlight during this quarter, with its revenue jumping by 28% to $12.3 billion. According to the report, this was driven by the company's core cloud services, AI infrastructure, and new AI-powered solutions</p><p>With respect to AI, during the earnings call, Pichai also stated that they're seeing healthy growth and momentum across all their AI-powered products. Specifically speaking about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-circle-to-search-ai-overviews-expands-galaxy-s25">AI Overviews</a>, the feature provides you a quick summary of your search has seen "over 1.5 billion users per month, and we are excited by the early positive reaction to<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-tests-experimental-ai-mode"> AI mode</a>."</p>

<p>During the call, Pichai was asked about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/us-doj-could-break-up-google-following-ruling">company's ongoing trial </a>with the Justice Department.

He noted that they are innovating with AI mode, an exciting roadmap ahead with the Gemini app as well.</p><p>Lastly, Alphabet's ventures outside of Google's products that are capped under "Other Bets" saw a decrease in revenue this quarter. This segment <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/24/alphabet-googl-q1-earnings-report-2025.html">generated</a> $450 million in revenue, which is much lower than the $495 million that it made in Q1 last year.</p>

<ul><li>OnePlus launched its 13T smartphone in China with a 6.3-inch flat FHD Plus screen, a 50MP primary lens, and a 50MP telephoto.</li><li>Internally, the phone rocks the Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC with loads of AI advancements for photos, notetaking, and more via ColorOS 15.</li><li>The OnePlus 13T focuses on games, too, offering 120 FPS for MOBAs and optimizations for many popular games.</li><li>The company has not listed a global launch yet for the OnePlus 13T.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>OnePlus is rolling out another phone for its consumers; one that's touted with a small screen, but big power.</p><p>Earlier today (Apr. 24), <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oneplus.com/cn/13t">the OnePlus 13T launched</a> in China following the company's slew of social media teasers. The latest T-series phone takes things down a notch by offering a smaller form factor for those who love that style. Unlike the flagship OnePlus 13 and its 6.8-inch QHD Plus display, the 13T delivers a 6.3-inch flat FHD Plus screen with a 120Hz max refresh rate.</p><p>OnePlus is also highlighting the device's lightweight feel, saying users can hold the device one-handed without fatigue.</p><p>A more standout detail is the new "shortcut key." The OnePlus 13T says goodbye to the fabled Alert Slider for this new multipurpose, frame-integrated button. Placed on the top left side of the phone's edge, the shortcut key gives easy access to your flashlight, sound/vibration (Alert Slider-esque), One-click flash memory, DND, recording, camera, and more.</p><p>OnePlus hopes the 13T's small frame won't disappoint as the phone packs a wallop: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>.</p>
<h2 id="gaming-ai-power-2">Gaming & AI Power</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="Sntr7kq696UZSt5QjApUx8" name="oneplus-13t-color-options" alt="The OnePlus 13T in a variety of colors: Morning Grey, Heart-pounding Pink, Cloudy Ink Black." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Sntr7kq696UZSt5QjApUx8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>All of this strength has to go somewhere, and OnePlus says the Snapdragon 8 Elite benefits the 13T's gaming capabilities. The company states users can reach up to 120 FPS during MOBA games (think League of Legends) and up to 60 FPS in open-world games (think Genshin Impact).</p><p>Additionally, the OnePlus 13T has rich optimization for games such as the ones described to give users a smooth experience when playing.</p><p>The other side of the new phone involves AI advancements, like OnePlus' reflection removal on photos. The 13T also receives AI Elimination (machine-translated), which functions like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-eraser-non-pixel-phones">Magic Eraser</a>, letting users quickly remove people and other objects from photos. OnePlus states ColorOS 15 on the phone is smooth, packing more AI features like AI Call Translation, Flash Memory (for notetaking), and more.</p>
<h2 id="long-lasting-glacier-tech-2">Long-lasting Glacier Tech</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:572px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:101.40%;"><img id="YSmbEHxzrs5sMvWzmYk8BD" name="oneplus-13t-rendering-official" alt="The OnePlus 13T in gray." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YSmbEHxzrs5sMvWzmYk8BD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="572" height="580" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With so much under the hood, OnePlus tries to invoke a sense of calm in its users by stating the 13T features its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-introduces-new-glacier-battery-featuring-6100mah">Glacier battery technology</a>. However, as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-13t-to-sport-a-gigantic-battery-in-its-smaller-form-factor">company recently confirmed</a> on Weibo, the OnePlus 13T is unlike the 13 and 13R counterparts. Each of those features a 6,000mAh battery, while the 13T offers a larger 6,260mAh battery.</p><p>Joining this is 80W super fast charging to ensure users aren't out of the action for long.</p><p>Other specifications include IP65 dust and water resistance, as well as a 50MP primary lens and a 50MP telephoto camera. The front-facing lens comes in at 16MP. Users will also find the following RAM/storage configurations: 12/256GB, 12/512GB, 16/256GB, 16/512GB, 16/1TB.</p><p>For now, the OnePlus 13T has observed a Chinese market launch for 3,999 Chinese Yuan (~$548). There's a chance the company will bring it overseas to the U.S. and other areas, but that remains to be seen. If this does happen, perhaps we're in for a global launch toward the summer.</p>

<p>Motorola's new Razr 2025 lineup is here, and it includes a new member: the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025. While the Razr Plus isn't going anywhere, the Razr Ultra now represents the company's top-of-the-line foldable offering. If you have the Razr Plus 2024, you'll want to compare the last-generation model to the Razr Ultra 2025 — not the Razr Plus 2025.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-series-hands-on">Razr Ultra 2025</a> earns its new name with a powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, a bigger internal display, and a 50MP selfie camera. However, all of that comes at a high cost. Specifically, the $1,299 sticker price of the Razr Ultra could be a deterrent for some, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus 2024</a> is only getting cheaper by comparison. That's why the older version could actually be the better value.</p><p>Let's break down the differences between the Razr Ultra 2025 and the Razr Plus 2024, so you can decide which one to buy or whether to upgrade.</p>

<p>Motorola's Razr Ultra 2025 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-arrives-as-a-trio">will become available starting May 15</a>, and pre-orders will start on May 7 at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/best-buy">Best Buy</a>, Amazon, and through Motorola's online store. It starts at $1,300, with a higher-priced 1TB storage configuration available and various carrier and trade-in deals optional. It's available in four Pantone colorways: Rio Red, Scarab, Mountain Trail, and Cabaret.</p>

<p>The last-generation Motorola Razr Plus 2024 is still available and has an official retail price of $1,000, but isn't sold at that price often anymore. Motorola, Best Buy, and Amazon all currently have the Razr Plus 2024 priced at $800, and that could drop lower once the Razr 2025 lineup is available. It's sold in one 256GB storage configuration in five colorways: Midnight Blue, Hot Pink, Spring Green, Peach Fuzz, Paris Hilton Edition, and Mocha Mousse.</p>

<p>The Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 and the Razr Plus 2024 have extremely similar dimensions, with the biggest differences between them being their weight. The Razr Plus 2024, at 189 grams, is 10 grams lighter than the Razr Ultra 2025. This could be enough to notice in your hand or a pocket, especially when the phone is closed. Otherwise, the Razr Ultra is slightly thicker, but the two clamshell foldables have the same general footprint.</p><p>Motorola significantly improved the Razr's durability with this year's lineup. The Razr Ultra 2025 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/is-the-motorola-razr-2025-waterproof">now has an IP48 certification</a>, adding dust resistance for the first time. It does have the same water-resistance rating as the Razr Plus 2024, but the older model is IPX8 and this has no dust protection.</p><p>Additionally, the Razr Ultra 2025 has a new Gorilla Glass Ceramic covering for the cover display. The Razr Plus 2024 only offers Gorilla Glass Victus, and lacks the titanium-reinforced hinge and new foldable display covering found on the new model.</p>

<p>At first glance, you might think that the Razr Ultra 2025 and the Razr Plus 2024 have the same cover screen. They do, for all intents and purposes, as they're both 4-inch pOLED panels with LTPO technology and 165Hz refresh rates. But the Razr Ultra 2025 has improved peak brightness capabilities, as it can hit 3,000 nits. The Razr Plus 2024 can only peak at 2,400 nits, which could make it harder to use outdoors.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3754px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="RohBotZnfQzj9EcAas6UNc" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-hands-on-09" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 with a ring around the cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RohBotZnfQzj9EcAas6UNc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3754" height="2112" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The other small display tweak is that the Razr Ultra 2025 has a slightly larger inner screen. It's now using a 7-inch pOLED panel, which is ever-so-slightly bigger than the Razr Plus 2024's 6.9-inch pOLED screen. More importantly, the Razr Ultra 2025 can hit 4,500 nits of peak brightness, a significant improvement over the Plus 2024's 3,000-nit capabilities.</p><p>Motorola is deepening its collaboration with Pantone by offering unique colorways and an Alcantara material on the Razr Ultra 2025, but both that model and the Plus 2024 variant have equally-eccentric color and finish options.</p>

<p>Motorola is offering a truly flagship-caliber flip phone with the Razr Ultra 2025, and that starts with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset</a> on the inside. It's built using Qualcomm's custom Oryon cores for improved performance and features an AI engine for on-device processing. Plus, the phone now has 16GB of memory for all that AI.</p><p>The Razr Plus 2024 is using a lower-tier Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 chip that's now a generation old, but it still should be more than capable for daily use. That's paired with 12GB of memory, which again should suffice. Both phones support 5G, Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, and NFC.</p>

<p>In a way, the Razr Plus 2024 actually has a better camera system than the Razr Ultra 2025, since the former has a telephoto lens. It's a 50MP, f/2.0 telephoto that provides 2x optical zoom on the Razr Plus 2024. There's no optical zoom on the Razr Ultra, as the phone's secondary camera is a 50MP ultrawide with a 122-degree field of view.</p><p>The Razr Ultra 2025 has a new main camera: 50MP, f/1.8 sensor with Instant all-pixel PDAF and optical image stabilization. The Razr Plus 2024's main lens is quite similar, though, as it's also a 50MP sensor but with a f/1.7 aperture and only dual-pixel focus. The Razr Ultra 2025 is equipped with a 50MP selfie camera, while the Razr Plus 2024 has a 32MP selfie camera.</p><p>Of course, since these are foldables, you can always use the rear cameras as a selfie camera with the cover screen.</p><p>The new model ships with Android 15 out of the box, while the Razr Plus 2024 shipped with Android 14, and both are using Motorola's Hello UI skin. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> rollout for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024">Razr Plus 2024</a> is said to be ongoing, but the update has had numerous issues this far. Both phones have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-many-software-updates-will-the-motorola-razr-plus-2024-receive">meager update promise of 3 years of OS upgrades</a> and an extra year of security updates.</p>

<p>The Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 certainly has the specs to command a $1,299 price tag, but there's no doubt that the Razr Plus 2024 is the better value. The phone still offers the same size cover screen, a capable Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 processor, and a telephoto lens for $500 less than the Ultra 2025 at the time of publishing. It's only getting cheaper, too.</p><p>But if you spring for the Razr Plus 2024, you're accepting a waning software support window that could only see your phone get two more Android OS upgrades — including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> update that's just months away.</p><p>For those that are willing to pay a lump sum for the best clamshell foldable money can buy in the U.S., the Razr Ultra 2025 is there. There are plenty of durability, performance, and display improvements that can be used to justify the upgrade. Even still, it may be a tall ask for customers to pay the same price as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> for a Motorola phone in 2025.</p>

<h2 id="can-border-patrol-search-your-phone-at-the-u-s-border-2">Can border patrol search your phone at the U.S. border?</h2>
<p>Something a little different this week, but it's in the news cycle and is a subject full of questions with very few answers given. I'm talking about crossing into the U.S. and getting your phone searched.</p>
<p>This isn't anything new, or anything because of Donald Trump and Elon Musk. It <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/cbp_directive_3340-049.pdf" target="_blank">started in 2009</a>, and according to what senior intelligence officials have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/american-citizens-u-s-border-agents-can-search-your-cellphone-n732746" target="_blank">told NBC News</a>, ramped up in 2016 when the FBI was unable to stop American citizens from conducting attacks inside the country they call home.</p><p>It's also not unique to the U.S. and many countries will want to look at your phone, tablet, and laptop upon arrival. I can only speak of what I know, though, so this is going to be very U.S.-centric.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cbp.gov/travel/cbp-search-authority/border-search-electronic-devices#:~:text=CBP's%20border%20authorities%20permit%20the,devices%20crossing%20our%20nation's%20borders." target="_blank"><strong>The United States Customs and Border Patrol can search any object, without any specific level of suspicion, within 100 miles of the U.S. border. That means your backpack, wallet, car, and phone.</strong></a><strong> </strong></p><p>Civil rights groups and lawmakers are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Letter%20to%20DHS%20re%20border%20searches.pdf" target="_blank">split over the constitutionality</a> of this, but the Department of Homeland Security stands firm that it can conduct warrantless searches of electronics at the U.S. border and they have more guns so they win.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5312px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="suvvP7ZTdYzWir6gygJQad" name="airport.jpg" alt="Dulles International Airport" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/suvvP7ZTdYzWir6gygJQad.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5312" height="2988" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand)</span></figcaption></figure>
<h2 id="can-i-refuse-should-i-2">Can I refuse? Should I?</h2>
<p>Yes, you can refuse but not without consequences. Those depend on your citizenship status.</p><p>If you are an American citizen your electronics can be forcibly removed from your person, but you can not be compelled to provide the password. I said <strong>password</strong> intentionally here because court cases have affirmed that law enforcement can force you to provide a fingerprint or other form of biometric authentication but can not compel you to give up your password.</p><p>Your device can be held for an undetermined amount of time or even denied entry, but you can not be because you did not provide your password. they'll have to find another reason if they want to deny you entry or detain you, and they probably will.</p><p>If you are not a U.S. citizen the answer is easier; turn over the phone and the password if asked or go back home. The government says you have no right to enter the country and you have to follow all rules and directives to gain access. If you don't, you are turned away.</p>
<p>As for what you should do, well that's not for me to say. I know what I would do and why: I would tell them I am a U.S. citizen and they can pound sand, let them hold me against the wall and pull my phone out of my pocket, and never tell them the password. I will never give up an inch of my liberty willingly and unless they helped pay for the phone or the service, they aren't getting it.</p><p>That's a narrow and possibly dangerous way to think and I can't recommend it. But you need to ask yourself the same question and form your own answer.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="m2gGtboCUmgFz22uo33T7" name="android-enterprise-recommended-hero.jpg" alt="Android Enterprise" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/m2gGtboCUmgFz22uo33T7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1536" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p>The first thing to do if you carry a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-enterprise-recommended">work phone</a> is ask your boss what to do. Your company probably has very strict access rules for its information and may have an existing policy; a large car manufacturer has told its employees to refuse and get on the first plane back to Germany, for example.</p><p>For your personal device, you can do a few things to minimize your personal risk. There are two levels of search, a basic search and a seizure. For a basic search an officer will gain access and look through your device, They will look at your photos, messages, social media, etc. to see if they find anything suspicious.</p><p>The next level involves an agent connecting your phone to equipment that clones the data so it can be looked at more thoroughly. This requires "reasonable suspicion" though what that is has never been defined.</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-phone-security"><em><strong>See our guide to the best phones for security in 2025</strong></em></a></li></ul>
<p>What I would do if I were a foreign national on the way into the U.S., and what I'll recommend to you isn't difficult at all: don't give them any reason to be suspicious.</p><p><strong>Do not wipe your phone</strong>. Presenting a phone that's been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-factory-reset-android-phone">reset</a> is the opposite of not acting suspiciously. Don't do it.</p><p><strong>Turn off biometrics</strong>. this doesn't protect you if you're not a citizen, but it's a hurdle that's not suspicious. If they want in, make them ask and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-disable-biometrics-on-your-android-phone-from-the-lock-screen">allow access on your terms</a>.</p><p><strong>Make sure you haven't turned off encryption</strong>. That's not easy to do and unless you did something you found on the internet, you probably didn't. This goes for your apps, their associated data, and the entire contents of the phone itself. When the screen is locked, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-googles-backup-encryption-works-good-bad-and-ugly">everything should be encrypted</a>.</p><p><strong>Don't delete your social media</strong>. Clean it up instead. Delete any posts you think might cause you trouble in case they are saved on your phone.</p><p><strong>Delete your local data</strong>. Go through your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-now-lets-you-spice-up-your-pictures-with-ultra-hdr-glow">photos</a>, your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-and-when-clear-app-cache-or-data-android">application cache</a>, your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chrome-for-android-clear-browsing-data-shortcut">browser history</a>, and anything else that stores what you're been doing and erase it.</p><p><strong>Disconnect your phone</strong> <strong>from the internet</strong>. CBP is not allowed to look through your online data, but your apps often present it when opened. If you're not connected, they can't. Legally, an officer is required to ask you to disconnect from the internet before a search of your phone is started. Don't wait for them to ask.</p><p><strong>Don't be a jerk</strong>. It might be tempting and I know I would do or say something stupid, but try not to. If you're acting like a jerk they might, too. Follow directions and ask questions respectfully no matter how you feel about the situation.</p>

<p>Realistically, your phone probably isn't going to be searched upon entry. Certain groups have a higher chance (no, we're not diving into that plie of racism and xenophobia) and are treated differently, but at most expect a cursory look at your phone when you come into the country.</p><p>If it does happen, be prepared. It's a price you might have to pay if you want to visit the U.S.</p>

<ul><li>Rumors claim Samsung's development of a Galaxy S25 FE continues, but with some older internal tech.</li><li>The device may feature the company's toned-down Exynos 2400e, the same chip found inside the S24 FE.</li><li>Samsung has done this before, like the Galaxy S23 FE, which features the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Rumors say Samsung's next flagship series' FE device is real, but it might not excite you with raw strength.</p><p>Information obtained by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s25-fe-m36-5g-soc-leak-3546771/">Android Authority</a> through a "reliable source" states internal code points toward the existence of a Galaxy S25 FE. The post says Samsung typically attaches an "R" modifier to devices belonging to its FE series. With that in mind, there's reportedly code with the name "R13," which seemingly points toward the S25 FE.</p><p>A more usual/normal codename that we're used to hearing about wasn't readily available, but this might be our first glimpse of its development.</p><p>More importantly, Samsung's internal code details another important aspect of the phone: its potential SoC. Sources lead the publication to believe the device could launch with the Exynos 2400e SoC due to its internal tag appearing alongside code for the S25 FE.</p>
<h2 id="year-old-tech-again-2">Year-Old Tech... Again?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wtxvdX499hQ8iyMTHK6Yj4" name="samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-mint-1.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy S24 FE mint" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wtxvdX499hQ8iyMTHK6Yj4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We can take these rumors with a grain of salt, considering how the device might not launch for a while. However, there's a chance this could come to fruition, considering Samsung has a past of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-fe-hands-on">using year-old tech in its FE phones</a>. One device we can look back on is the Galaxy S23 FE. After launching in the fall of 2023, its detailed specs showed Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 SoC, the flagship chip choice for phones launching in 2022.</p><p>What's arguably the most relevant example is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-hands-on">Galaxy S24 FE</a>. The alleged chip for the S25 FE, the Exynos 2400e, is currently featured inside Samsung's latest fan edition phone. It's worth keeping in mind that while it wasn't a bad chip, for its time last September, the 2400e is roughly 100MHz slower than its stronger 2400.</p><p>The chip clocks in at 3.11GHz, which is far slower than Samsung's recent choice of the Snapdragon 8 Elite with a 4.47GHz in its flagship S25 trio.</p><p>The idea of a "Fan Edition" phone is to appeal to the more affordable market, so it's expected not to hold the same power as a flagship. We'll have to see where things end up, as rumors claim the Galaxy S25 FE could see a launch in the second half of 2025.</p>

<p>Anyone my age will likely recall seeing Toy Story for the first time. I had just celebrated my 10th birthday a few weeks before its release, and to say I was thrilled to see toys come to life in fancy new CG animation was an understatement. It also helped that Pixar was a master at storytelling.</p><p>But the idea of toys themselves moving around and playing was a concept that stuck with me. Toy Commander, a 1999 Dreamcast release, remains one of the most memorable games of my childhood because it shares that same theme, and now some recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">Meta Quest 3 games</a> have caught my attention in the same way.</p><p>Recently, Plastic Battlegrounds has been trending <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@plasticbattlegrounds">on TikTok</a>, racking up millions of views with shorts that perfectly recreate those moments when you played with plastic army men as a kid. The difference is that now you're not just moving the little guys around, you're actually fighting alongside them, commanding them, or just seeing what it's like to pretend to be Sid.</p>

<h2 id="plastic-battlegrounds-2">Plastic Battlegrounds</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8frQwGO665I" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Plastic Battlegrounds debuted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/plastic-battlegrounds/7796723770415439/">on the Meta Quest platform</a> on October 14, 2024. While it's a sandbox game still very much in development, the classic theme and the impulse buy price of $9.99 quickly rocketed it to success. The game describes itself as "<strong>the</strong> newly commissioned sandbox toy-based battle simulator where your plastic soldiers engage in intense set piece battles of your imagination."</p><p>That last part is key. Plastic Battlegrounds isn't going to blow anyone's minds with its advanced AI or cutting-edge graphics. The game looks fine enough on a Meta Quest 3S, but the real joy is recreating scenes from your childhood and, maybe even more relevant today, <em>making content</em> from those ideas.</p><p>Because, let's face it, there's something fun about making your own version of Toy Story with your own ideas at the helm. Since you can choose either to embody a toy soldier or get a kids-eye view of the scene and command them, there are plenty of ways to work the angles and come up with a creative story along the way.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tv37Nb54D6M" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>The video above embodies the true spirit of the game and what I think is the real fun in playing it: pretending. There's something truly amazing about seeing plastic soldiers come to life. Being able to spawn them and command them just adds a cherry on top, and the game's different levels all help realize a childhood fantasy of being a tiny toy in a giant room.</p>

<p>The developers specifically note that Plastic Battlegrounds was designed as a sandbox game, but two other modes are currently available and in active development. "Sandbox would be the optimal game mode to get the most out of the Plastic Battlegrounds experience," they note, and it's clear from social media posts that people love playing this way.</p><p>In this mode, you embody a plastic soldier and can spawn, command, and fight your own way through an unlimited number of enemies and scenarios. A bunch of different maps — kitchen, basement, hallway, backyard, etc. — give you different parts of the house to play in, and each of the two alternative modes gives you additional options.</p><p>Spawning in units is simple, but you'll want to be careful not to spam that spawn button too many times. While a Quest 3 or 3S can handle lots of units just fine, a Quest 2 will have a tougher time managing a decent framerate. I look forward to seeing where this game's development takes it, especially if the developers can get a good multiplayer mode going.</p>

<p>Plastic Battlegrounds might be trending right now, but it was Toy Trains VR that gave me the first "Toy Story" feelings more than a year ago. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/toy-trains/5655022154520888/">Toy Trains VR</a> is an absolutely brilliant puzzle game that's polished in a way most Meta Quest games wish they could be. The goal is to assemble a toy train track to connect all the towns in an area, helping to transport goods between each location.</p><p>The game sports a uniquely toy-like quality with excellent graphics — complete with a fur-shaded carpet — all of which takes place in your grandfather's attic. I can remember venturing up to my grandparent's attic when I was a kid and finding similar sets of trains, so this one immediately evoked a sense of nostalgia for me.</p>

<p>What I love about Toy Trains VR is that it's not just a sandbox game, although there is a sandbox mode if you love that sort of thing. Rather, the main single player mode follows a heartwarming story that's well put together AND well voiced, something that adds a rather intriguing bit of character to what would otherwise be "just a puzzle game."</p><p>And that brings me to the mechanics. The available tracks are cleverly laid out for you to grab, letting you know exactly how many, and what type, of pieces are available for you to finish each puzzle. The introductory levels are quite easy and give you a good idea of what to expect, while the later levels will provide sufficient challenges for even hardcore puzzle fans (that is a thing, right?).</p>

<p>Before both of these other games, though, was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/lego-bricktales-meta-quest-3-impressions">LEGO Bricktales</a>. This brilliant puzzle platformer puts a life-sized LEGO diorama in front of players' faces, letting you control a LEGO character that traverses each area as you build the missing pieces.</p><p>It was originally shown off as one of the premier mixed reality titles when the Meta Quest 3 was first announced, and the result was even better than I had hoped. While some might have just wanted a plain sandbox LEGO game, I far prefer this style of storytelling that melds nicely with LEGO construction.</p><p>While most LEGO games are the same — third-person action games with lots of combat and collection but little brain usage — LEGO Bricktales rewards players who enjoy exploration and puzzle solving. It's particularly amazing being able to fully walk around these life-sized dioramas and find the secrets hidden within.</p><p>There's a serious childlike wonderment that bubbles up inside me while playing this game, and it made me freshly appreciate the spatial nature of VR games. It's even nicer that you can have the whole game hover in front of you no matter where you stand (or sit), giving you the freedom to fully explore or build each piece as if it were real.</p>

<p>Watch faces on Wear OS are one of the best ways to let your personality shine, and I frequently swap between them based on my mood. But one thing I hadn't considered before someone asked me was which Wear OS brand had the <em>best</em> watch faces.</p><p>So I fired up my Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra and Google Pixel Watch 3 to look through every watch face, complication, and color variations available, and compare what style and data they bring to the table.</p><p>Then I bullied my colleagues Andrew Myrick and Nick Sutrich into looking through every watch face on their TicWatch Atlas and OnePlus Watch 3, respectively, since I wanted every Wear OS brand (besides the Eurasia-only Xiaomi) represented.</p><p>Let's dive in and compare first-party Wear OS watch faces for style, variety, customization, and quantity.</p>

<p>The sheer diversity of watch faces in the Galaxy Wearable app is impressive. Virtually every non-gimmicky Samsung-made watch face has dozens of colors, several customizations, and more system complications than any other brand, while the downloadable third-party options have more limited variations but give you a wider range of styles.</p><p>I highly recommend using the Wearable phone app to look through and edit your watch faces; the on-watch customization options work well enough, but some "premade" variations only show up in the mobile app.</p><p>Specific to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra</a>, you'll find some Ultra watch faces that take advantage of the extra space to fit up to eight complications. I typically use this for my Samsung Health data, but there's a wide range of Google- and Samsung-made toggles for popular apps.</p>

<p>More generally, Samsung has more animated or "live" watch faces than other Wear OS brands, like Funny faces, My style, Live Wallpaper, or Friends. They're quite cool (if a bit distracting), with unique smarts like pointing out when you have unread notifications or swapping patterns with a tap.</p><p>Once the novelty wears off, I avoid animated watch faces, not only because of battery drain, but also because they rarely leave room for any non-clock data fields. The latter also applies to custom faces like Google Photos or Bitmoji.</p><p>Out of Samsung's watch face categories, I'm a fan of the Analog and Informative faces: they squeeze in tons of useful information while making that crowdedness look intentional and stylish. For something more colorful and minimalistic, the Numbers faces are great.</p><p>I'm less of a fan of the Classic and Simple faces, because they look a bit too minimalist and don't really fit the <em>look</em> of a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a> or Ultra; they'd be better suited to the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8 Classic</a>.</p>

<p>Google made the smart choice of making every premade watch face customization visible in the main "Add watch faces" menu. So even though it has half as many official watch faces as Samsung, it <em>looks</em> like hundreds because each face has 5–10 premade variations.</p><p>Plus, Google lets you look at and customize faces before committing to one, while Samsung makes you add them to your watch before you can see your options.</p><p>Logistics aside, half of Google's watch faces follow the Material You aesthetic with bright colors and large clocks that run up against the edge of the rounded <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3 </a>display. The rest either fall into data-heavy fitness or traditional classic/ analog faces that you see on most smartwatches.</p>

<p>My colleague Nick said that Pixel Watch faces "have the best style because they fit so well with the watch's aesthetic, but a lot of them are pretty useless other than to tell the time."</p><p>I'm quoting him because I couldn't put it better myself: faces like Digital Bold, Big Time, Abstract, and Vista look striking enough, but some — especially Large Scale and Prime — are a bit too simplistic with their sans-serif fonts and empty space.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="djRQVHZ4MWGxuunYgjQAQ8" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-3-main-watch-face.jpeg" alt="The default Active watch face on the Google Pixel Watch 3." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/djRQVHZ4MWGxuunYgjQAQ8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Active watch face </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google made "Active" the default face for a reason, I think. Its rounded fonts and bright colors look Google-ish, but it leaves plenty of room for Fitbit complications or Google app shortcuts that people buy Pixel Watches for. I tend to like the busyness of the Field and Adventure faces more than the minimalist look of faces like Index and Utility.</p><p>Whichever watch face you end up with, I think Google does the best job of making its AOD-mode faces look like a stylish inverse of the active face, while other brands' AOD mode simply dims the screen or removes elements.</p>

<p>Nick looked over each of the 19 OnePlus watch faces, but admitted that after his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-review">OnePlus Watch 3 review</a>, he's continued to stick with the default watch face, whereas he didn't care for the main Watch 2 face.</p><p>"I feel like all of the best ones on this watch take full advantage of the 1.5-inch screen size and cram a bunch of info onto it," Nick explained, "whereas my favorite Pixel Watch faces are very minimalist because they look good on the shape."</p><p>While OnePlus has a decent amount of variety and plenty of complications, none of its alternative watch faces have tempted Nick to switch. It's been a while since I've taken out my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2r-review">OnePlus Watch 2R</a>, but I also don't recall its official watch faces being particularly striking during that review stretch.</p><p>OnePlus does have a unique video watch face feature, but like Samsung's animated faces, I doubt people will stick with this battery-draining gimmick. I think a bigger priority for OnePlus is to add more stylish watch faces in general that match with its Classic titanium chic.</p>

<p>Andrew, like Nick, isn't that impressed with the watch faces on his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ticwatch/mobvoi-ticwatch-atlas-review">TicWatch Atlas</a>. Of the 15 available — including the TimeShow app — he says that he regularly switches between five of them. That's not a bad rotation, but he "doesn't have much of an opinion on the other 10 besides them just taking up space." Ouch!</p><p>His favorite, shown in the photo above, is the same sort of data-heavy, fitness-focused face that you'd expect on any fitness watch, focused on cramming in a lot of information. Compared to that, the faces that "try to look like an 'actual' watch just aren't that appealing" to Andrew.</p><p>Part of this comes down to preference, of course, but it's also fair to point out that because Mobvoi has fewer first-party watch faces than most Wear OS brands, you're less likely to find many that fit your tastes.</p><p>Thankfully, Mobvoi does at least have plenty of Google and TicWatch complications available, if not quite as many as its Wear OS rivals. You also get an ultra-basic watch face on the battery-saving secondary screen that does, at least, come in dozens of color options.</p>

<p>Objectively, it's hard to argue against Samsung Galaxy Watches here. Whether you prefer classic, analog, minimalist, data-heavy, or gimmicky motion watch faces, Samsung gives you the most options, with different fits to match the standard, Classic, or Ultra models.</p><p>Google prioritizes style over ruggedness, and the lack of a bezel makes its faces stand out more prominently than other brands' faces. But your opinion of them will depend on what you think of Google's modern Material You theming. You get very few "classic" faces, and it's hard to differentiate between faces when every single one has a black background.</p><p>Either brand gives you plenty of customization options, but I think Samsung lets you choose one to match your personality while Google railroads you a bit to its style.</p><p>Ultimately, I'm happy with what both brands bring to the table, but I still think that Google needs to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5-blocks-facer-and-makes-watch-faces-boring">unblock Facer</a> on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a> so that it's easier to find third-party options outside of the messy Play Store. And I'm also curious if Google will consider letting us use Gemini to generate pretty watch face backgrounds.</p>

<p>The Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 has a 7-inch, 1,224p AMOLED HDR10+ Super HD inner screen with adaptive 165Hz refresh rate and 4,500 nits peak brightness. It’s a Pantone-validated display so you’ll get Pantone-validated colors and skin tones. The outer screen is a 4-inch pOLED HDR10+ 417ppi screen with the same adaptive 165Hz refresh rate and 3,000 nits peak brightness.</p><p>Available in Pantone colors, including Rio Red, Scarab, Mountain Trail, and Cabaret, you can choose from luxe satin-inspired or durable leather-inspired finishes. It’s the first phone to use Italian Alcantara material, the same you’ll find on items like Louis Vuitton bags. There’s also an option for FSC-certified wood so you can choose the design and material that suits you.</p><p>Covered with Corning Gorilla Glass Ceramic, the phone is durable, marking the toughest external display of any Razr to date. The phone meets an IP48 rating for dust and water resistance. It has a titanium-reinforced hinge that Motorola says is four times stronger than surgical-grade stainless steel and can withstand up to 35% more folds than the previous generation device. Ultra-thin glass also ensures a smoother display.</p><p>Customize the external display with dedicated panels for things like contacts, communications apps, streaming music, weather, and more. The phone also has dual stereo speakers that support Dolby Atmos and three microphones.</p><p>Equipped with 512GB or 1TB storage, you can load tons of games, apps, photos, videos, and more onto this 5G foldable phone. It charges via USB-C and has a 4,700mAh battery that supports 68W TurboPower charging (get a full day in just eight minutes) as well as 30W wireless charging and 5W reverse charging.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 comes in Blue, Yellow, Mint, or Silver Shadow, plus Samsung exclusive colors Crafted Black, White, and Peach. The foldable design consists of a 3.4-inch 720 x 748 inner Super AMOLED screen with a 90Hz refresh rate and 1,700 nits peak brightness that unfolds to reveal the larger 6.7-inch 2,640 x 1,080 FHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2x 120Hz main screen with 2,600 nits brightness.</p><p>Slim and compact with a floating design, the phone is relatively durable, sporting an IP48 rating for resistance against dust and water as well. The screen is made of Gorilla Glass Victus 2 and it has a reinforced folding edge with the FlexHinge for easily opening and closing it along with an Armor Aluminum frame with a matte finish. Derrek Lee says in his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">review of the Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> that the hinge is stiff and sturdy, as is the phone in its entirety. He adds that the crease is hardly noticeable.</p><p>Lee isn’t fond of the design of the external screen, however, finding that it offers limited ability to interact with notifications or even scroll through details or select different days. He also finds that apps feel condensed, making navigating UIs awkward.</p><p>Equipped with 256GB or 512GB non-expandable storage, the 5G device charges via USB-C, the port of which also works as an ear jack. Other specs include Bluetooth 5.3, GPS, NFC, and stereo speakers. The dialogue booster feature is appreciated, and Lee says it does “exactly as it states, and works surprisingly well.” He also loves the haptics that emit a slight vibration when you type, swipe back, or open the sidebar.</p><p>The phone runs on a 4,000mAh battery and supports 25W wired charging, 15W wireless charging, and 4.5W reverse wireless charging. It lasts all day on a single charge: Lee would get from about 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. before needing to recharge. But it charges much more slowly than the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025, so this is worth keeping in mind for power users.</p>

<p>As a newer phone released in late April 2025, the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 comes loaded with Android 15. If following the pattern of other Razr devices, you should get three years of software and four years of security updates, which is decent but not quite as long as Samsung’s standard.</p><p>The Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 runs on a Snapdragon 8 Elite octa-core processor, making it the most powerful foldable phone on the market today. It also comes with an impressive 16GB RAM. It also supports Motorola’s RAM Boost feature which allows you to convert available storage space to RAM when needed, though we’ve had mixed experiences with this feature in the past.</p><p>The phone is built with moto AI, which includes tons of cool AI-powered features leveraging the dedicated on-device AI engine, like Catch Me Up, Pay Attention, and Remember This. Next Move takes advantage of the external display, recognizing what’s on the screen and offering suggestions for the next step. It could be, for example, generating a playlist with Playlist Studio while you bake a cake from an online recipe, or creating an image or wallpaper in Image Studio that’s inspired by an upcoming trip.</p><p>There’s also Smart Connect with AI that allows you to use voice or text commands to do things like pull up a video on your big screen TV or mirror content to a secondary device like a PC or tablet for multitasking. The Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 even has a dedicated AI key that you can press to access moto AI at any time. In his initial <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-series-hands-on">hands-on review of the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025</a>, Lee says he appreciates this dedicated button versus having this feature double on the power button.</p><p>Flip the phone into stand or tent mode and chat hands-free with moto AI to ask questions, summarize notifications, or transcribe conversations. The Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 also comes with Google’s Gemini and Gemini Live access so you can use this smart assistant and all the features that come with it as well. Lee is impressed by the addition of even more AI apps, like Meta’s Llama, Microsoft Copilot, and even Perplexity. Motorola is really upping its AI game with this phone.</p><p>We’ll provide more details on the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 once we have had more time to spend with it and can deliver a full review.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3733px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="Rx8GrebHaZcAUbk2bPTbGU" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-One-UI-7-welcome" alt="One UI 7 welcome screen on the Galaxy Z Flip 6, sitting in front of colorful plants" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Rx8GrebHaZcAUbk2bPTbGU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3733" height="2100" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Comparatively, the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 comes loaded with Android 14 with One UI 6.1.1 since it’s already a year old. However, you get seven years of software and security updates. So, you can not only update to Android 15, you’ll be able to continue updating for another six years to come.</p><p>Running on a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 octa-core processor, Lees says it performs “exceptionally well…this phone breezes through everything you throw at it.” It has a Vapor Chamber to keep it cool while multitasking or gaming, marking a first for a Galaxy Z Flip device. Lee says it occasionally gets warm while gaming, but never uncomfortably hot. Equipped with 12GB RAM, this phone can keep up with the most demanding tasks and games.</p><p>Built with Galaxy AI and Google Gemini, you get the same Google Gemini AI experiences that are available in other AI-powered phones, like Circle to Search, live translate, and transcript assist. You can use the Gemini assistant for everything from help composing e-mails to summarizing webpages and booking vacations. But there are also some unique Galaxy AI features that make use of the foldable design.</p><p>There’s interpreter, for example, that leverages the Flex Window for real-time language translations, one of the top features for making use of the external display. Lee finds that it works well. With Chat Assist, you can send messages directly from the FlexWindow, even choosing from suggested replies that are curated by the content-aware AI.</p><p>Lee loves features like Drawing Assist and Sketch to Image, which he calls “truly fascinating,” turning your doodles into works of art. He’s less impressed with Portrait Studio but loves the Live Effect feature for transforming 2D photos into cinematic videos. Other worthwhile features include Slo-Mo for saving clips, Composer for writing comments, e-mails, and more based on past conversations and prompts, and the Recorder app.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3953px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="qPhLx9TFxTKf3sUC29ECvd" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-hands-on-02" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 in a red ring stand case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qPhLx9TFxTKf3sUC29ECvd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3953" height="2224" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For taking photos and videos, the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 has a triple 50MP camera system that includes a main 50MP camera, a 50MP ultra-wide camera with Macro Vision, and a 50MP front camera. You get features like Super Zoom and plenty of the usual camera modes.</p><p>There’s also Group Shot for capturing multiple frames within a second and seamlessly blending them together for a perfect shot. With Action Shot, you can get blur-free photos of subjects on the move as the shutter speed adjusts automatically based on lighting conditions. And there’s Air Gesture for capturing photos and videos using hand gestures to start, stop, and pause recording. Leverage Flex View positions as well for things like tripod shots, gesture controls, and external previews.</p><p>We haven’t been able to spend significant time with the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 just yet to provide feedback on the camera experience. Stay tuned!</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4197px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="L3wga9PVH57KmCYYXtjYrm" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-review-06.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 in Camcorder Mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/L3wga9PVH57KmCYYXtjYrm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4197" height="2361" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Take photos from the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 using the 50MP main camera along with the 12MP ultra-wide and 10MP front “selfie” camera. There are options like Nightography, instant slo-mo, and live effect, all of which make use of the ProVisual Engine. There are plenty of photography features powered by AI as well, like generative edit.</p><p>Lee finds that photos have plenty of contrast, depth, and vibrancy with this phone, though he says the camera does struggle with dynamic range. Skies in photos, for example, will often appear blown out. The cameras also struggle with movement, so you may end up with blurry images that lack detail and with some distortion at the edges of the image if the subject is moving. But he was able to capture some great moving images of objects like cars and animals like a cat.</p><p>The camera handles zooming and low light well, he adds, but he isn’t a fan of how his darker skin looks when taking selfies with the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6. Given the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025’s focus on skin tones, this gives it a massive leg up in this department.</p><p>For recording videos, Lee loves the feature that turns the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 into a camcorder when you fold it 90° and hold it sideways. The UI adjusts to fit the viewfinder at the top half while you can use a zoom slider on the bottom while recording. Neat! He recommends downloading the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-customize-samsung-galaxy-camera-settings-good-lock">Camera Assistant app</a> to get more useful features, including a 2x button for faster zooming, auto HDR, and a faster shutter button.</p>

<p>When it comes down to specs of the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 vs. Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6, the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 is the all-around better phone. It has larger screens yet isn’t that much bigger. It has a bigger battery, a better front camera, and tons of AI features through both Gemini and moto AI.</p><p>It has more RAM, more storage, charges more quickly, and comes in tons of finish and material options. If you’re not already within the Samsung ecosystem and you’re looking for a solid foldable phone, it’s the better model to consider. But it’s also more expensive so it will make a bigger dent in your wallet. That’s the one early concern Lee has, despite noting that the phone is a huge step up with “the best hardware and all the AI it can include in its phones.”</p><p>Plus, this phone won’t be supported for as long as the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6, which will be up to date for another six years. If longevity is your main concern, you’ll get more bang for the buck with the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6. And it has some really impressive features, too.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 currently ranks as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">the best foldable phone</a>, but the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 is prepped to give it a run for its money. If you have the money to spare and you’re looking for an ultra-durable, feature-rich foldable phone, the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 is certainly one to consider.</p>

<ul><li>Google has kickstarted an Extended Repair Program for users with a Pixel 7a.</li><li>This comes off the back of it identifying issues of "battery swelling," which could lead to a bulging rear panel and quicker than normal battery drain.</li><li>If users have an impacted device, they must run through the checks to see if they're eligible to see their next steps.</li><li>Google's had to run similar programs for the Pixel 8 and Pixel 4 XL, as well as a few Fitbit devices earlier this year.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has reportedly identified a problematic battery issue plaguing the Pixel 7a and is detailing your next steps if affected.</p><p>The company published a support document for the Pixel 7a's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/16043453">Extended Repair Program</a>, which concerns a "battery swelling" issue (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/04/23/pixel-7a-extended-repair-program/">9to5Google</a>). User reports may have tipped Google off about this issue. The company states it has "determined that certain Pixel 7a phones may experience unexpected battery swelling." Battery swelling is a serious issue that consumers should <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone?p=pixel7a_battery_flow&sjid=3542098779619822395-NA">deal with accordingly</a> should their device shows signs of it.</p><p>Google states you can identify instances of battery swelling if the back of your phone is bulging/appears thicker than usual. Moreover, you'll notice small gaps around the edge of your phone, indicating the battery is pressing against and lifting its back panel.</p><p>Once you've checked to see <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone?p=pixel7a_battery_flow&sjid=3542098779619822395-NA">if your Pixel 7a is eligible</a>, Google says impacted devices can receive "one battery replacement at no charge" through its battery replacement program. Additionally, Google will conduct a thorough inspection of the device to ensure you can receive this treatment. Keep in mind that if your battery displays any sign of liquid damage, sharp object exposure, or "excessive force," that may void your eligibility for a free replacement through the program.</p>

<p>Once you've gone through the checks, Google says users should find mail-in and walk-in repair center options. Those in the U.S. and India will find both options available; however, others in Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, and Singapore will only have the repair center choice available.</p><p>Also, these countries, excluding the U.S. and India, will find <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/16043453#:~:text=and%20warranty%20status).-,Appeasement%20options,-Carefully%20select%20your">a few appeasement options</a> for their Pixel 7a troubles. Such options include a $200 payment (converted to a user's local currency).</p><p>Google has a history of running repair programs for its Pixel phones, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-goes-all-in-on-fixing-pixel-8-screen-issues-with-a-warranty-extension">like the Pixel 8</a> in 2024. Users reported screen issues for a few months, prompting the company to take action and solve the issues: vertical lines and randomly turning green. If consumers had an "Impacted Device," Google was granting a three-year extended warranty to cover users. If we're talking battery-specific issues, Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/googles-pixel-4-xl-phones-battery-issues-are-getting-one-year-warranty-extension">Pixel 4 XL suffered power-related problems</a>, but Fitbit devices had issues recently, too.</p><p>Users may remember from January when Fitbit drew awareness about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-sense-versa-3-battery-overheating-warning-reported">overheating issues</a> with the Sense and Versa 3. Google delivered an official statement about the problem, stating it "poses a potential risk for users and requires an immediate firmware update."</p>

<p>Motorola has finally released a proper flagship, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">top-of-the-line foldable</a> with a thousand-dollar price tag to match. It only makes sense that the most exciting foldable of the year so far should come in four colors that are the opposite of cliche. The Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 color is available in a quad of striking colors. Choosing the right one involves listening to your inner desires and color matching the Razr Ultra to your style.</p><p>Rio Red is all class and elegance. This deep brick red hue is warm, luxurious, and rich. It isn't as bright as some of the other reds we've seen from Motorola, but this might be a good thing for folks who prefer more muted shades. It's the most striking colorway to go for, especially in that timeless vegan leather finish.</p><p>The other hue that demands attention this time around is the wooden Mountain Trail variant in all of its champagne gold glory. It's almost deceptive to the eye because the wood somehow emanates a metallic texture. This captivating Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 colorway is my second recommendation if the Rio Red just isn't doing it for you. Mountain Trail has oomph and pizzaz, sure to dazzle you for all the years you hold on to your Razr Ultra.</p>

<hr>
<p>Motorola's big day continues as the company prepares a couple of accessories to get along with its latest foldable trio.</p><p>No smartphone (or foldable) launch is complete without a new pair of earbuds, at least that's what Motorola thinks, per a press release. Today (Apr. 24), the company launched the Moto Buds Loop, its first open-ear buds that seek to blend style and comfort with Sound by Bose tech.  While remaining sleek and light, Motorola says the Buds Loop will "mold to users' ears" when worn.</p><p>Delivering this strong sound are 12mm ironless drivers, which Motorola claims will make your beats come to life. Additionally, the open-ear buds contain spatial audio capabilities, enabling consumers to hear aspects of music and videos they never knew were there.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="QYnjc4PWhLRY2E8XYDH82e" name="motorola-buds-loop-french-oak" alt="The Moto Buds Loop sitting on a plane's window in French Oak." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QYnjc4PWhLRY2E8XYDH82e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Though sleek and stylish, Motorola remains confident in the durability of its first open-ear buds. The post claims the device can withstand the "wear and tear" of daily life as it leverages premium materials for its water repellent design. Motorola says this should aid users who love hitting the gym or going for a stroll in some light rain. Bringing everything together is the Loop's long-standing battery.</p><p>The open-ear buds feature a battery that lasts roughly 8 hours on a single full charge. However, if you've got its case handy, the Buds Loop can grab a total of 37 hours from it.</p><p>Earbuds are good for talking to, and Motorola says your voice will remain clear, thanks to CrystalTalk AI. The Buds Loop contains a dual-mic system, which captures your voice with "precision" while also "minimizing background noise." AI aids users' voices, but the implementation of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a> works to enhance your daily routines. Motorola says when users connect their Buds Loop to their device — say, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-arrives-as-a-trio">a Motorola Razr 2025</a> — they can "trigger Moto AI actions with simple voice commands."</p><p>These commands include notification summaries and audio recordings. Smart Connect support is also available for consumers, making it easy to swap sound between Motorola and Lenovo devices "without interruption."</p><p>The Moto Buds Loop will be available this summer in "select" countries. Users will be notified of its official pricing closer to launch. What's more, the Buds Loop is prepared to launch in Pantone-curated Trekking Green and a dazzling Pantone-curated French Oak, featuring crystals by Swarovski. Keep in mind, the French Oak option will vary in availability.</p>

<p>New phone, new earbuds; how about a new watch? Motorola drops the details for its new Watch Fit, a device designed to handle the hustle and bustle of a busy life. Remaining close to Motorola "sleek and fashionable" focus, the Watch Fit delivers a 1.9-inch OLED display that's protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 3. Motorola states the device is equipped with 1,000nits of peak brightness, to ensure you're able to see the important stuff even in broad daylight.</p><p>Speaking of daylight, the Watch Fit keeps health and fitness at its core. While the device can "seamlessly integrate with any Android," the Watch Fit tracks workouts and monitors your wellness. The post says the watch offers over 100 sports modes, advanced heart rate tracking, and built-in GPS for walks. If you are out on a run or in the gym, the Watch Fit's IP68 and 5 ATM water resistance ratings ensure dirt and sweat aren't a worry.</p><p>When the night comes, the Watch Fit's sleep monitoring software works to improve your sleep by delivering "actionable" insights.</p><p>Users can grab the Moto Watch app to track fitness goals and more on their phones. Moreover, the Watch Fit's phone integration makes it so you never have to reach for your phone, as it offers its own set of media controls, photo capture buttons, and more. Powering consumers through their days is a 16-day battery life when fully charged.</p><p>The Moto Watch Fit will be available "over the coming weeks;" however, official pricing will surface closer to that date. Users should also get ready to see it in Pantone-curated Trekking Green with the additional option of third-party 22mm bands.</p>

The Razr 2025, Razr Plus 2025, and Razr Ultra 2025 are all IP48 certified, which means they can withstand submersion in 1.5 meters of water for up to 30 minutes in fresh water. </p></article></section>
<h2 id="everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-motorola-razr-2025-s-water-and-dust-resistance-2">Everything you need to know about the Motorola Razr 2025's water and dust resistance</h2>
<p>Foldable phones are historically less durable than their traditional counterparts, but recent iterations have bucked that trend. With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025">Motorola Razr 2025</a>, the phone's improved IP48 certification adds dust resistance for the first time but leaves the water-resistance capabilities unchanged. In an IP (ingress protection) rating, the first number represents a device's dust-resistance rating, and the second number represents the water-resistance rating.</p><p>The IP48 rating ensures that the Motorola Razr 2025 will be able to survive being submerged in 1.5 meters (just under five feet) of water for up to half an hour in ideal conditions. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-do-waterproof-dustproof-rugged-ip-rating-numbers-mean" target="_blank">IP certification tests</a> are conducted in fresh water, so your phone won't be as protected if it is dropped in a chemically cleaned pool, like a chlorine pool. The same goes for salt water, whether that's a saltwater pool or a day at the beach.</p><p>Salt water and electronics don't mix, meaning you'll want to keep your Razr 2025 out of it, despite the phone's IP48 certification.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4064px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="koLWjXKCDwQYaL7Ksi9VWd" name="Motorola-Razr-2025-series" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 with the Razr Plus 2025 and Razr 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/koLWjXKCDwQYaL7Ksi9VWd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4064" height="2286" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's also worth noting that these IP certifications cover the Motorola Razr 2025's capabilities when it is brand new. After the Razr 2025 is dropped or mishandled, the waterproofing seal or gaskets could be damaged. It's important to remember that any phone's water-resistance capabilities will naturally degrade over time.</p><p>The Motorola Razr 2025's upgraded IP48 rating puts it in line with some of the other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">best foldable phones</a> in its class. For instance, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> has an IP48 rating too. Newer non-foldable phones have a higher level of water resistance, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">IPX9 or IP69</a>, which tests specifically against high-temperature and high-pressure water jets going up to 1,450 PSI.</p><p>However, you won't miss this certification on the Motorola Razr 2025, as it doesn't add any depth or duration to a phone's water-resistance capabilities. The IP48 rating on the Razr 2025 means it'll handle rain, splashes, and most accidental drops with ease, and that's what matters.</p>

<p>The Motorola Razr 2025 series is finally here, and for the first time, Motorola brings its Razr series as a trio, showcasing the standard Motorola Razr, the Motorola Razr Plus, and an all-new Motorola Razr Ultra.</p><p>Motorola states that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-series-hands-on">Razr 2025 series</a> was designed keeping style and durability in mind. The phones get a new titanium-reinforced hinge plate, which is 4x stronger than surgical-grade stainless steel. This is paired with an ultra-thin glass that creates a smoother display on these devices.</p><p>All three models come packed with Moto AI features that are said to go beyond a "traditional assistant" and be more of an "intuitive companion" to the user.  The existing Moto AI suite gets three additional advanced features previously in beta: <strong>Catch Me Up</strong>, <strong>Pay Attention</strong>,<strong> and Remember This</strong>.<strong> </strong>Meanwhile, a new feature, <strong>Next Move</strong>, recognizes what’s on the screen, like a new recipe or trip itinerary, and offers suggestions for next steps.</p><p>In addition to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a> suite, the phones come equipped with Google's Gemini features, which provide additional support for writing, problem-solving, and creative thinking. Additionally, new users get three months of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-advanced-subscribers-can-now-use-gemini-flash-2-0-experimental-in-latest-gemini-app-beta">Gemini Advanced </a>and three months of<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/perplexity-ai-motorola-samsung-agreement-discussions-reported"> Perplexity Pro</a> for free. The company has ensured that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/perplexity-ai-motorola-samsung-agreement-discussions-reported" target="_blank">Perplexity AI app</a> is preinstalled, allowing it to work seamlessly with the device's cover screen. It's also integrated into Moto AI, so users can dive into Perplexity with the tap of a button directly from Moto AI.</p><p>Regarding the various models, each offers a distinct set of specifications, so let's take a closer look.</p>
<h2 id="motorola-razr-ultra-2">Motorola Razr Ultra</h2>

<p>The new Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 arrives with bigger displays when compared to the other two in the lineup. At first glance, it holds the same design and overall look as previous Motorola Razr models; however, the Ultra, as the name suggests, is larger.</p><p>The device features a 4-inch pOLED cover display and a 7-inch main foldable AMOLED display. To ensure these displays remain intact, the phone features the toughest external display, protected by Corning Gorilla Glass Ceramic. The cover display boasts 3,000 nits of peak brightness and a 165 Hz refresh rate, while the internal display features 4,500 nits of peak brightness, maintaining the same 165 Hz refresh rate.</p><p>At its core, the device is powered by the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-soc-for-galaxy-s25-series">Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset</a>, much like some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android phones</a> on the market. As for the camera, the Ultra model comes with a major upgrade, featuring a 50MP primary camera and an additional 50MP ultrawide/macro vision camera. Additionally, it also features a 50 MP selfie camera, which sets it apart from the rest of the Razr models.</p>

<p>The clamshell features IP48 dust and water protection, which means it can be submerged in up to 1.5 meters of freshwater for approximately 30 minutes. Powering all of this is a massive 4,700 mAh battery, which comes with 68W TurboPower, 30W wireless charging, and 5W reverse charging.</p><p>The Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 comes in four colorways: Pantone Scarab, Pantone Rio Red, Pantone Mountain Trail, and Pantone Cabaret. Each of these colors is available in distinctive finishes, including luxe satin-inspired and durable leather-inspired options. It's also the first phone to feature Alcantara fabric material, and there's also a wood option for those who remember Moto Maker.</p><p>As for the price, the Ultra starts at a hefty $1,299 and comes with dual storage options of 512GB and 1TB, depending on the retailer, along with an impressive 16GB of RAM.</p>

<p>The Motorola Razr Plus 2025 has become a middle child of sorts, considering the Ultra has now become the company's premium model. Looking a lot like its predecessor, the Razr Plus 2025 gets an interactive 4-inch cover display and a 6.9-inch internal foldable pOLED display.</p><p>While the cover display achieves 2,400 nits of peak brightness, the main internal display reaches 3,000 nits and features a 165 Hz refresh rate. The display features Gorilla Glass Victus protection, and a soft, non-slip leather-inspired finish enhances the overall feel of the new Razr Plus. At the same time, the device features a 6000 series high-strength aluminum frame and a stronger "Titanium-reinforced" hinge.</p><p>At the heart of the device is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8s-gen-3-announced">Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 </a>chipset, similar to the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-motorola-razr-plus-2024-just-crashed-well-below-its-black-friday-price-but-theres-a-catch"> Razr Plus 2024</a>. The new Razr Plus 2025 also retains the same camera specs as last year's model. It comes with a 50 MP primary camera, a 50MP 2x telephoto lens, and a 32MP front-facing camera. The Plus model, like the rest of the series, also features IP48 dust and water protection.</p>

<p>Not much has changed when it comes to the device's battery capacity as well. The phone arrives with a 4,000 mAh battery that supports 45W TurboPower charging as well as 15W wireless charging and 5W reverse charging.</p><p>As for the colors, the Motorola Razr Plus 2025 comes in three colorways: Pantone Mocha Mousse, Midnight Blue, and Hot Pink. The device has a 256GB built-in storage and 12GB of RAM. As of now, this device will only be available in the U.S. for $999.99.</p>

<p>As for its standard model, the company is keeping it simple while also integrating some premium specs into it. The Motorola Razr 2025 arrives in different finishes, including durable leather-inspired, nylon-inspired, and lightweight acetate finishes.</p><p>The standard model features a smaller 3.6-inch pOLED cover display, boasting 1,700 nits of peak brightness and a 90Hz refresh rate. As for its foldable internal display, the phone features the same 6.9-inch AMOLED screen, with a peak brightness of 3,000 nits and a 120Hz refresh rate. Much like the Ultra and Plus models, the standard Razr gets an IP48 dust and water certification, and is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass Victus on the front.</p><p>At its core, the phone is powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-7400-7400x-ultra-efficient-gaming-ai-chips">MediaTek Dimensity 7400X</a>, a notch higher than its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/the-motorola-razr-2024-is-the-best-pocketable-phone-and-its-on-sale-right-now">predecessor</a>. Regarding its rear cameras, the standard model features a 50MP primary camera system and a 13MP ultra-wide camera equipped with a Macro Vision lens. The device retains its 32MP front camera from its predecessor.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Motorola's 2025 Razr series is officially here, months earlier than its predecessor's launch. It may seem odd to launch so early, as the 2024 Razr series has had less than a year to revel in its apparent success, but it seems Motorola is excited to get things rolling this year, and for good reason.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025">Razr 2025 series</a> marks a significant shift in Motorola's strategy, with the company launching three models this year instead of the usual two. Leading the trip is the top-end Razr Ultra 2025, which has specs that would make most standard <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android flagship phones</a> jealous, although all that power does indeed come at a price. Following are the Razr Plus 2025 and Razr 2025, the latter of which I still lovingly refer to as the Razr "Minus."</p><p>I got some hands-on time with all of these devices, including new AI features and accessories, and I must say I'm quite impressed with what Motorola is doing with the Razr Ultra. That said, I'm a bit worried that one key aspect of the Razr Ultra may overshadow this impressive device.</p><p>Here are my initial impressions.</p>
<h2 id="more-razr-for-everyone-2">More Razr for everyone</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Q4uD6JrUXYHyJc2Us5C4se" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-hands-on-17" alt="Different colors of the Razr Ultra 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Q4uD6JrUXYHyJc2Us5C4se.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Razr Ultra 2025 was the primary focus of my attention during the hands-on, as it's the newest addition to the Razr family, which previously only consisted of the Razr and Razr Plus. However, despite its premium status over its siblings, the Ultra and Plus share much of the same design, and the hardware looks nearly identical.</p><p>The cover screen is the same size at 4 inches, and despite the display being .1 inches larger on the Ultra (thanks to smaller bezels), the difference seems negligible. Aside from the colors and materials, the primary way to distinguish them is the presence of a new AI Key to activate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai" target="_blank">Moto AI</a> (more on that later).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4089px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hgU4hPwJptqeQeMjBMRSMe" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-hands-on-15" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 AI key" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hgU4hPwJptqeQeMjBMRSMe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4089" height="2300" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Since Motorola seems allergic to glass back panels these days, the Razr Ultra comes in some pretty exciting new colors and finishes, including an FSC-certified wood finish and Alcantara. This isn't Motorola's first wood phone, and hopefully it won't be the last, as it gives the phone a surprisingly light yet sturdy feel in hand.</p><p>This is, however, the first phone to feature Alcantara fabric, which is found on the likes of the Lucid Air, Louis Vuitton bags, and other high-end products. On the Razr Ultra, it not only looks great with the stitching along the back, but it feels incredibly soft to the touch.</p><p>The Razr Plus and Razr are admittedly less exciting, but they still offer some great color options. The Plus only features three colors, which are borrowed from its predecessor— a common theme with this phone. In contrast, the Razr 2025 introduces all-new hues, including a vibrant green and a pleasant pink.</p>

<p>Notable hardware changes include a new titanium hinge, which Motorola claims is four times stronger and should withstand more folds. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2023-how-it-started-how-its-going">Razr Plus 2023</a> had a relatively flimsy hinge, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus 2024</a> marked a notable improvement. In my limited time with the device, the hinge didn't feel significantly different from the 2024 model, but I'll need more time with the Razr Ultra 2025 before I can provide a more informed comment.</p><p>IP48 water and dust resistance are also highlights, while the Ultra gets the new Corning Gorilla Glass Ceramic for extra protection on the cover screen.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4047px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="gmhSgVXRgbnH96842LxVUe" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-hands-on-20" alt="Holding the Razr Ultra 2025 in hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gmhSgVXRgbnH96842LxVUe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4047" height="2276" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The design surprisingly says a lot about the hardware in these phones. The Razr Ultra comes with bold new colors and finishes, which translate to impressive specs underneath. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> makes this the most powerful flip phone to date, while 16GB of RAM is enough to make even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> jealous.</p><p>Additionally, there's a new Pantone-validated Super HD display that looks fantastic; it's bright, responsive, and vibrant, with a crease that's somehow even less noticeable than its predecessor.</p><p>The Razr Ultra also has Pantone Validated cameras for better skin tone and color reproduction, and the 50MP dual camera system now has a secondary ultrawide sensor after last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025-needs-to-ditch-telephoto-camera">featured a fairly limiting 2x telephoto lens</a>.</p><p>Finally, the battery specs make a <em>huge</em> jump with a 4,700mAh capacity, 68W wired charging, and 30W wireless charging. I'm already pleased with the battery life on the Razr Plus 2024, so I'm really excited to see what the extra juice does with the Ultra.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4SKK4pMU3d5DEjsMzpqELe" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-hands-on-05" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4SKK4pMU3d5DEjsMzpqELe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Razr Plus, like the design, gets probably the fewest changes of the trio. The same chip should prove adequate, but it would've been nice to see some sort of upgrade in this manner. Aside from the new hinge, IP48 certification, and Pantone-validated display and cameras, the core specs are largely the same as those of the Razr Plus 2024.</p><p>Even the Razr 2025 received more changes, featuring an upgraded <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-7400-7400x-ultra-efficient-gaming-ai-chips">MediaTek Dimensity 7400X</a> and a larger 4,500mAh battery, along with the aforementioned improvements also found in the Razr Plus. We'll have to see how the phone performs with this new chip, but I had no issues with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2024-review">previous Razr model</a> in terms of performance.</p>

<p>Motorola is leaning heavily into AI, which is good to see, as it previously felt like the company was falling behind its competitors in this regard. Moto AI is now a fully fledged AI hub with features that feel genuinely interesting and helpful.</p><p>For example, Next Move is the result of user feedback from the initial Moto AI beta, as there were concerns that Motorola's features and use cases weren't clear. By evoking Moto AI whenever there's content on the screen, it can suggest various actions based on what's displayed, such as saving a recipe, generating an image, or creating a playlist. It can also recommend other Moto AI actions like Remember This or Pay Attention, making it easy to utilize Moto AI.</p>

<p>The new Image Studio is also an intriguing addition, providing users with a hub to generate images and wallpapers that utilize AI features, such as Sketch to Image, which was recently introduced on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/moto-g-stylus-2025-hands-on">Moto G Stylus 2025</a>.</p><p>Motorola is also making it easy to access Moto AI with the new AI Key on the Razr Ultra. As someone who dislikes it when companies try to force their AI assistance onto the power button, having a dedicated key is a welcome feature. There's some customization here, too, but it didn't feel as robust as I would've liked.</p><p>One feature that intrigued me was Look and Talk, which is as simple as it sounds. When the Razr Ultra is tented, you can just look at it and it will start listening to you, ready to respond to whatever query you may have. I wasn't able to try this myself, as the phone can only recognize one face. However, in the demonstrations I saw, it worked pretty well and feels like something I would love to see on a Pixel with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/gemini-live-pixel-9-pro-grocery-list">Gemini Live</a>.</p>

<p>Other Moto AI features received notable updates as well, but what shocked me was how Motorola appears to be gathering AI partners to help boost Moto AI. In addition to Gemini, there's now Meta’s Llama, Microsoft Copilot, and even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/perplexity-ai-motorola-samsung-agreement-discussions-reported">Perplexity</a>, the latter of which is pre-installed and optimized to some extent with Moto AI.</p><p>It really feels like Moto just wants to give users the choice of whatever AI model is best for certain tasks, and while I'll need time to test out how this all comes together in practice, it's something I can appreciate.</p>

<p>It wasn't just phones and AI; Motorola is also highlighting its accessories with new earbuds and a new smartwatch.</p><p>The Moto Buds Loop look quite stylish, especially with Swarovski in play on a blinged-out edition of the buds. I've recently come to appreciate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/best-open-ear-earbuds">open ear earbuds</a>, and there's no doubt the Bose tuning should make these quite capable.</p>

<p>Finally, the Moto Watch Fit is an Apple Watch clone with a robust battery life and plenty of health monitoring options. It's also incredibly lightweight and durable, although it seems to be missing one big thing: Wear OS.</p><p>Android Central senior editor Michael Hicks recently wrote about how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/why-doesnt-motorola-make-another-wear-os-watch">Motorola needs to return to Wear OS</a> following impressive launches from Samsung and OnePlus, so it's sad to go another year without a Moto 360 revival given the success of the Razr.</p>

<p>After seeing how much Motorola improved the Razr Plus 2024 over its predecessor, perhaps it shouldn't surprise me too much that the Razr Ultra is a major step up. Now that the Razr has found its footing in the market, Motorola appears serious about providing consumers with a premium experience by incorporating the best hardware and all the AI it can into its phones.</p><p>However, I'm concerned that the $1,299 price tag for the Ultra may deter consumers, and that the Razr Plus hasn't changed enough to justify its price. We'll have to see how things go as the year progresses; I just hope Motorola isn't shooting itself in the foot, because the Razr Ultra 2025 <em>feels</em> like such a good phone that you should want to buy. I know I do!</p>

I talked about how the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-a56-is-the-worst-mid-range-phone-i-used-in-2025">Galaxy A56 is the worst mid-range phone</a> I used this year, and the Galaxy A36 is much the same — with the only difference being that the device is a smidgen more affordable. <br><br>There are other alternatives to consider; I really like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/poco-x7-pro-review">POCO X7 Pro</a>, and Nothing's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-pro-best-budget-phone-india">Phone 3a Pro</a> is a terrific choice. And there's now a new contender thanks to Infinix. I haven't covered the brand much over the years, but it's clear that the Transsion-owned phone manufacturer is intent on increasing its global presence, and it is rolling out pretty great phones.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="o3cYCTXTsb84eMBs77NJRJ" name="Infinix Note 50 Pro Plus" alt="Infinix Note 50 Pro Plus against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o3cYCTXTsb84eMBs77NJRJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Note 50 Pro+ made its debut last month, and the phone will go on sale globally for the equivalent of $370 — undercutting the Galaxy A36. That's not all though; with the Note 50 Pro+, Infinix managed to deliver one of the most feature-packed phones in this segment — the device gets a silicon-carbon battery, a 3x telephoto lens at the back, Dimensity 8350 platform, an AMOLED with 144Hz refresh, and an aluminum build.</p>
<h2 id="great-design-with-unique-extras-2">Great design with unique extras</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="NvYXQ59DnPqg3ruwh6GkRJ" name="Infinix Note 50 Pro Plus" alt="Infinix Note 50 Pro Plus against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NvYXQ59DnPqg3ruwh6GkRJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Clearly, Infinix is looking to make a statement with the Note 50 Pro+. The device has better hardware than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/redmi-note-14-pro-plus-review">Redmi Note 14 Pro+</a>, and it's the best value you'll find in the budget category this year. I also like the design quite a bit; the phone has an octagonal camera housing made out of glass that sits on a metal island, and the design looks pretty distinctive. The build quality is among the best of any budget phone, with Infinix using an aluminum mid-frame — the Galaxy A36 uses a plastic chassis.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="yxbMMUneXaG26Kc4hAgpWJ" name="Infinix Note 50 Pro Plus" alt="Infinix Note 50 Pro Plus against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yxbMMUneXaG26Kc4hAgpWJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Like every other phone around, the Note 50 Pro+ has a flat profile, and as it doesn't have beveled edges, it isn't quite as comfortable to hold and use the device as higher-end options like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a> or even the Pixel 9a. That said, that's about the only drawback I noticed on the design side of things; the volume and power buttons are located in the ideal location, and the back has a smooth finish that prevents smudging.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="nupMr2YVE86t76w6etTsQJ" name="Infinix Note 50 Pro Plus" alt="Infinix Note 50 Pro Plus against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nupMr2YVE86t76w6etTsQJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Interestingly, the phone gets an optical module underneath the cameras, and this is used to measure heart rate and blood oxygen levels. It does a pretty good job in this regard; I tested it against the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/withings-scanwatch-nova-best-hybrid-smartwatch">ScanWatch Nova</a>, and it was accurate.</p>

<p>The 6.78-inch AMOLED panel is quite decent, and while it doesn't get quite as bright as the POCO X7 Pro, it has good color vibrancy. What I like the most about the panel it that it has 144Hz refresh — there is a noticeable fluidity to the UI that's better than just about every other budget phone — and it gets 2,304Hz PWM dimming as standard. Samsung and Google don't use PWM dimming on their high-end phones (much less their budget devices), and this is an area where Chinese brands are absolutely dominating. <br><br>Like most Chinese manufacturers, Infinix doesn't allow gaming beyond 60fps, but this wasn't as big an issue as on a flagship. If anything, the Dimensity 8350 platform does a brilliant job at gaming, and the phone is among the best budget devices in this regard.</p>

<p>There are other niceties; you get 12GB of RAM as standard, and the device comes with 256GB of UFS 4.0 storage. It's refreshing to see brands switch to 256GB as base storage, and while Samsung and Google still haven't done so, this isn't an issue on most Chinese phones.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="3FeZFWs8XXPY73VZsxMxVJ" name="Infinix Note 50 Pro Plus" alt="Infinix Note 50 Pro Plus against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3FeZFWs8XXPY73VZsxMxVJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The 5200mAh battery lasts all day without any issues whatsoever, and it uses silicon-carbon tech to increase density. It takes just over 40 minutes to charge the phone thanks to 100W charging tech, and I didn't run into any issues in this area. And yes, there is a charger bundled in the package; Infinix has a generous accessory bundle as well, and that's good to see in 2025. <br><br>That said, the 5200mAh battery is on the lower end of the scale as these things go — the X7 Pro gets a 6500mAh unit in India — so the Note 50 Pro+ doesn't quite measure up to its immediate rivals. That said, it is better than the Galaxy A36, and even the A56.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="D3U4ZPgF8oscChwyedyaQJ" name="Infinix Note 50 Pro Plus" alt="Infinix Note 50 Pro Plus against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/D3U4ZPgF8oscChwyedyaQJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The camera is clearly the star of the show on the Note 50 Pro+, with the device featuring a 50MP main camera alongside a 50MP telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom. The latter is a novel enough addition in this segment that its inclusion immediately gives the Note 50 Pro+ an advantage, and it utilizes the sensor to good effect. There's also an 8MP wide-angle lens, but it is strictly average. <br><br>You get great photos in daylight, and while there are a few inconsistencies in the image quality at night, the phone has one of the best camera packages in this category. The versatility is refreshing to see, and the 3x sensor makes a noticeable difference in daily use. I used that sensor much more than the wide-angle lens, and it's good to see a budget phone getting the module.</p>
<h2 id="a-great-value-all-around-2">A great value all around</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Z3Xfffjuw7pftS8Y5bpmRJ" name="Infinix Note 50 Pro Plus" alt="Infinix Note 50 Pro Plus against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Z3Xfffjuw7pftS8Y5bpmRJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Then there's the software. The Note 50 Pro+ runs XOS 15 based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>, and the interface is quite similar to what you get on Xiaomi's phones. There's a split notification pane, app drawer that automatically sorts apps, a global search mode, and good amount of customizability. <br><br>While I noticed some bloatware on the device, it was easy enough to uninstall, and the interface itself looks clean — it has a cohesive design. In fact, the only annoyance is that the phone will get just two platform updates; that's just not adequate in 2025, and Infinix needs to do better. <br><br>Other than that, the Note 50 Pro+ turned out to be a much better device than I imagined. It has a terrific hardware package and the most versatile set of cameras in this category, and it nails the basics. The best part is the affordability; it doesn't cost as much as the A36, and that makes it a standout deal.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-37">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Samsung is reportedly bringing its Galaxy Unpacked event back to NYC this July, shaking up its usual timeline.</li><li>If the report is right, it’ll be the first time in nearly three years that NYC hosts the foldable launch since the Galaxy Z Fold 4 and Flip 4 in 2022.</li><li>Mass production of the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Flip 7 presumably kicks off in May, signaling a fast track to their July debut.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A fresh report from South Korea says Samsung is gearing up to bring its summer Galaxy Unpacked event back to New York this July.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.joongang.co.kr/article/25330940" target="_blank">The JoongAng Daily</a>, instead of sticking to its usual timeline, Samsung is reportedly moving its Galaxy Unpacked event up, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Flip 7</a> expected to make their debut in the early weeks of July.</p><p>If the report is accurate, it will mark a pretty big shift from Samsung's usual summer playbook. It’d also be the first time in about three years that NYC hosts the foldable spotlight again, with the last one being back in August 2022 for the Galaxy Z Fold 4 and Flip 4.</p><p>Last year, Samsung unveiled its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> in Paris on July 10. That said, even with that in the rearview, the exact date for this year’s big reveal is still up in the air.</p>

<p>An earlier report from South Korea’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://thebell.co.kr/free/content/ArticleView.asp?key=202504162329253040101110&lcode=00&page=1&svccode=00" target="_blank">The Bell</a> claims Samsung is kicking off mass production of its upcoming foldables in May. The scoop supposedly comes from Samsung Display, the folks behind the screens. If that timeline holds, it’s a solid sign things are ramping up for the next-gen foldables to hit shelves soon.</p><p>The rumored May start for mass production lines up pretty well with the buzz about a July launch. The original article hints at a foldable launch in the “latter half of the year” (machine translation). So, it's safe to bet Samsung is rolling up its sleeves for another big Galaxy Unpacked to mark the occasion.</p>
<h2 id="upgrades-incoming-2">Upgrades incoming</h2>
<p>The rumors around the upcoming Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Flip 7 point to a solid step up from the Fold 6 and Flip 6. Previous reports hint at some meaningful upgrades and polished refinements across the board.</p><p>Considering the trends in tech, it’d be pretty wild if the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Flip 7 didn’t roll out with the Snapdragon 8 Elite. Furthermore, the Z Fold 7 is likely getting a camera boost and a thinner look.</p><p>Along with the foldables, the July event should also bring a new Galaxy Watch, Samsung's Android XR headset, and some early looks at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-might-hold-back-the-budget-galaxy-z-flip-7-model-until-late-2025">Galaxy Z Flip FE</a> and the rumored “tri-fold” device.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google's Workspace feature drop for April 2025 is here with new AI tools for Gemini, Gmail, Slides, and Chat, the company announced in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspace.google.com/blog/product-announcements/april-workspace-feature-drop-new-ai-features-across-gemini-chat-gmail-and-slides" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p><p>These updates notably bring popular features from NotebookLM, an AI-powered notebook and studying tool, to the main <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini </a>app. Integrating with existing features like Deep Research, the upgrades effectively bring the NotebookLM experience to more people.</p><p>The rest of the handy new Workspace features help with everything from adding events to your Google Calendar to creating unique presentations with Google Slides. Let's dive in and review everything new added to Google Workspace this month.</p>
<h2 id="gemini-is-getting-a-few-excellent-notebooklm-tools-2">Gemini is getting a few excellent NotebookLM tools</h2>
<p>The list of Gemini upgrades added in April starts with Canvas, a new workspace accessible from the main Gemini app. Here, users can draft documents, generate code, and much more. Below the Gemini prompt bar, you will now find the <strong>Canvas</strong> button beside the <strong>Deep Research</strong> button. Selecting it will start a writing or coding project that can be created, refined, and eventually exported to Google Docs or elsewhere.</p>

<p>It sounds a bit like NotebookLM, but more conveniently accessible from the regular Gemini user-interface. Similarly, Google is similarly bringing Audio Overviews from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/notebooklm-can-now-help-you-discover-sources-on-the-web">NotebookLM </a>to the main Gemini app. For those unfamiliar, Audio Overviews take uploaded documents, slides, and more and turn them into spoken audio tracks that resemble the experience of listening to a podcast.</p><p>Audio Overviews in Gemini integrate with other features, like Canvas and Deep Research. For example, Google says a Deep Research report can be quickly turned into an Audio Overview. These features were <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-gets-new-features-canvas-audio-overviews">previously announced in March</a>, and are now widely available.</p><p>The same goes for Gemini 2.5 Pro (experimental), which is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-is-gifting-its-best-ai-model-yet-gemini-2-5-pro-exp-to-free-users">widely available for free Gemini users</a>, as announced on March 31.</p>
<h2 id="gemini-in-gmail-will-automatically-find-appointments-buried-in-your-emails-2">Gemini in Gmail will automatically find appointments buried in your emails</h2>
<p>Next up is a handy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gmail">Gmail </a>feature that will spot invites to on-site events in your inbox and prompt you to add the event to your calendar. This was already possible for shared Google Calendar or Google Meet invites, but this new Gmail tool works with written invites that have no connection to the Google ecosystem.</p><p>It's powered by Gemini, and can detect written details about events in emails you've received. Then, in the Gemini sidebar for Gmail, you'll seen an <strong>Add to Calendar</strong> button that'll automatically create a Calendar event based on the information.</p>

<p>Sidebars are becoming a mainstay of Google Workspace, and there's a new one specifically made for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/updates-for-docs-sheets-and-slides-app-on-android-tablets">Slides</a>. This design sidebar can be used to find templates, add building blocks, discover stock photos, or generate images with AI. It's neatly pushed to the side of the slide you're working on as to not block your view.</p>

<p>But while traveling with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">best Chromebooks</a> or other laptop usually means you have to forego some of the productivity a multi-monitor home or office setup provides, portable monitors will help fix that problem.</p><p>That's because monitor tech has come a very long way over the years, and while you won't be carrying around a massive 36-inch ultrawide monitor in your carry-on bag, you could pack in two specialized monitors that are built for on-the-go productivity. I've tried monitors from brands like KYY and Jsaux, plus some non-traditional solutions from companies like Xreal and others that you absolutely must see!</p>
<h2 id="one-monitor-please-2">One monitor, please</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sd2nAR8WZd29iVViLjpoK4" name="KYY-portable-monitor-01" alt="A KYY portable montior hooked up to a laptop via a USB-C connection" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sd2nAR8WZd29iVViLjpoK4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Realistically, if you're packing a Chromebook, you're probably trying to keep things light. The KYY K3 Portable Monitor 15.6'' is the right choice in this case, as it can usually be found for around $80 or less and comes in an incredibly elegant package. The monitor itself looks a lot like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">best Android tablets</a> because it comes with a preinstalled triangular folding folio case.</p><p>This case includes a hard backing that protects the monitor when it's in a bag and you'd have a hard time telling the difference between it and a tablet. As with a tablet, you fold it back into a triangle to prop the monitor up on any table or desk, and a single USB-C connection to your laptop delivers power, video, and audio. It's literally as simple as it gets, and it barely takes up any space in a bag because it's so thin.</p><p>If I had to pick any one solution, it would be this just because it's not only easy to carry but it's also easy on the eyes. The 1080p LCD panel is bright and vibrant, doesn't use PWM dimming, and really just looks great. It's not just the most affordable solution on this list but it also sort of proves that simple is best, especially when you're on the go. I brought this one to my mom's back at Christmas time (hence, the decor) and have used it on several occasions since.</p>

<h2 id="portable-dual-monitors-2">Portable dual monitors</h2>

<p>It might sound ridiculous, but two companies make excellent portable dual monitor solutions that'll deliver maximum productivity even in a small coffee shop. My favorite is the KYY X90 Laptop Screen Extender, which is a portable dual-monitor setup that you can use either to full capacity — shown above — or in one of a few different, less head-turning configurations.</p><p>The monitor comes in a single, folding package that includes a fully movable kickstand. The kickstand and monitors can be unfolded to nearly any angle and hold their place, letting you fully customize the angle of the monitors, as well as the angle of the stand. It's got two USB-C ports, one for charging and the other for display out, and the included short braided USB-C cable makes it convenient to use on a table without getting cords everywhere.</p><p>But my favorite thing about this setup is that it's not only portable — there's a built-in handle that makes it easy to carry around — but that you can fold the second monitor in and just use this as a one-monitor setup. That makes it super versatile, especially since you can tent the second monitor and make the whole thing a tall vertical monitor setup.</p>

<p>It's also made of aluminum, so it feels solidly put together and can withstand a reasonable drop without shattering. It's fairly heavy for a monitor, but not something that would feel uncomfortable in a backpack alongside your laptop. Be aware that it is a bit on the thick side since it's got a metal mid-section plus the two monitors that swivel out, so carrying it in your backpack with your laptop is going to feel like carrying four laptops.</p><p>The display quality is pretty reasonable, with 60Hz LCD panels that have a good range of brightness. While these won't win any awards for their visual quality, they're not bad at all and, on the bright side, won't hurt your eyes since they don't use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a>. Also, since they just connect to your laptop via a single USB-C cable, you don't need to worry about a secondary power cable or something like that, but they'll definitely pull your battery life down quite a bit.</p><p>As you can tell from the photos, this setup takes up a decent amount of space. There's no chance you'd ever get any extended monitor solution on a plane but this one might have trouble even on small cafe tables. If nothing, this is a great solution for working from a hotel room or a dining room table.</p>

<p>The second, more premium but less portable solution is the Jsaux FlipGo, pictured on the right in the image above. It's a pair of 16-inch <em>touchscreen</em> monitors that stack vertically instead of being positioned horizontally like the KYY monitors are. This makes it easier to position on a smaller table since it takes up space vertically.</p><p>The vertical alignment also means that the topmost monitor will be more comfortable on your neck than the rest of the setup or your laptop since you won't have to look down at all to see it.</p><p>Brady Snyder has been testing this unit for Android Central and told me, "after using this, I honestly don't think I could ever use those laptop-mounted displays." Like the KYY setup above, the Jsaux one connects to your laptop via a single USB-C cable that carries both video and power.</p>

<p>Brady told me, "there are desk stands like I pictured, and also folio stands for when you're out and about," so there's quite a bit of versatility with this setup. The monitor folds into a clamshell that's "kind of a laptop size, but a bit thicker," Brady said. "It looks cool connected to my Yoga Book 9i (which already has two screens), but it also works with any old laptop or desktop."</p><p>What's also cool is that this doesn't have to run as two individual monitors. Brady said that it can be run as one giant monitor if you wish, making it feel more like a tall canvas or even a giant foldable phone if you tent it like a laptop (pictured above).</p><p>The biggest downsides to this unit are its price — it's more than twice as much as the KYY dual monitor setup — and the bulkiness factor. Jsaux didn't make it one cohesive unit like KYY did, so you have to attach a cable between the two monitors and store it in "a clunky briefcase."</p>

<p>It's likely you've heard that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">best smart glasses</a> offer a "personal monitor on your face" anywhere you go. It's true, and my favorite pick for this solution is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-one-review">Xreal One</a>. These glasses plug into the USB-C port of your laptop, phone, or even consoles like the Steam Deck, then project a giant screen that conveniently rests on your face.</p><p>These glasses weigh 84 grams and feature super comfortable nose pads and a glasses arm design you can wear for hours without discomfort. They also feature the first-ever custom silicon inside a pair of smart glasses, enabling what's called 3DoF — that's 3 Degrees of Freedom — movement. In short, this means that the virtual monitor is "anchored" in place like a traditional monitor, even though it doesn't actually exist in physical space.</p><p>Some other smart glasses have offered this with special software you have to install, but Xreal One does it automatically with no additional software or configuration. You put them on and they <em>just work</em>. It's as effortless as the single monitor solution above and offers the best image quality thanks to the micro OLED displays behind the lenses, but they'll cost you almost as much as the dual touch screen monitors from Jsaux above.</p><p>Plus, since these glasses are light and the virtual monitor doesn't take up any physical space at all, you can even enjoy a giant 200-inch screen while sitting in a cramped airplane seat.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="sPSFaW7UBUS4RV2J7XWSeA" name="xreal-one-wearing-01" alt="Wearing a pair of Xreal One smart glasses while working on a laptop" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sPSFaW7UBUS4RV2J7XWSeA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I prefer smart glasses for many scenarios, as they're the simplest to set up and offer a giant monitor without needing the physical space. But there's something about having a physical monitor that's irreplaceable in some situations.</p><p>For that, the space-saving nature of the KYY single monitor setup is quite ideal, as its tablet-like form factor and simple USB-C connection also make it easy to get connected without hassle, lots of cables, or even hunting for an outlet. This makes the most sense to carry around with a portable Chromebook like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review">Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus</a> which works perfectly with all the monitors and smart glasses you see here.</p><p>Portable computing solutions have come a long way in the past few years alone, with different configurations that'll fit any budget or lifestyle. From powerful dual monitor solutions to simple, affordable single monitors, or even advanced smart glasses that give you a massive screen anywhere you sit, pick something from this short list and I'm confident you'll be happy.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Over the past few years, I've become increasingly concerned about eye health and how much time I spend on my digital devices. My colleague, Namerah, recently published an editorial about how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/rise-in-minimalist-phones">minimalist phones are the dumbphones of the modern era</a>, and it made me realize that E Ink phones seemed like the perfect solution for me.</p><p>So I did what any tech journalist would do: I reached out to the companies responsible for the trend so I could try one myself. I ended up with two in the same week, and while both devices share an E Ink screen and a chunkier design in common, the philosophies behind each device couldn't be more different.</p><p>And while the Mudita Kompakt and the Minimal Phone clearly have different ideas of what defines a "minimalist phone," the goal is largely the same: to cure you of your digital addiction. As Namerah Saud Fatmi said in her article, "None of these minimalist devices have colored displays, making them non-intrusive and less distracting."</p><p>But even if a minimalist phone is right for you, it's not a change you're going to be able to do cold turkey in one day. It's been (unsurprisingly) difficult to switch to a less capable phone, but that pain may ultimately cultivate something better in my life over time.</p>

<h2 id="it-s-kind-of-like-a-career-change-2">It's kind of like a career change</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="dTJBM6bAbKxtdpAE7MeDQW" name="minimal-phone-black-holding-01" alt="Holding the black Minimal Phone at my side" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dTJBM6bAbKxtdpAE7MeDQW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I'm not reviewing these phones just yet — that'll happen when I've had more than two days with each — but I do want to talk about my first two days with each device. Most modern phones are designed to be "glass and metal sandwiches," as we so often refer to them at Android Central. Both the Mudita Kompakt and the Minimal Phone have a very different vision of what phone hardware should look like, but they both seem to agree on two things: metal and glass don't make for a good pocket device.</p><p>Both phones sport a distinctly plastic body and a non-glass display cover, so there's little likelihood that either phone will break or shatter if you happen to drop them. I'm not sure I'm ready to call either design the next Nokia 3310, but each harkens back to a time when tiny bezels and Gorilla Glass weren't common phone traits.</p>

<p>The Minimal Phone looks and feels like a less premium <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/blackberry-keyone">BlackBerry KEYone</a>, and that's very much by design. Not only does it help keep the price down, but it also keeps you from wanting to behold its elegance and beauty throughout the day as you swipe through TikToks. The physical keyboard has a nice click to the keys but it's nowhere near as ergonomic or, again, elegant as BlackBerry's highly engineered designs.</p><p>And, if you do happen to pick up a Minimal Phone this year, avoid getting the black color. This thing is a fingerprint magnet and a half, and it's weirdly difficult to wipe them off.</p><p>Minimal is using a fairly standard version of Android 14 with the January 2025 security patch. This means all your favorite apps can be installed on the phone, but don't expect to be able to use everything the way you're used to. The screen simply doesn't allow for that, and it's funny how difficult it is to look at even a photo when it's in papery black and white.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="7zF7AuJyCbQ7Z8PJc2zZZk" name="mudita-kompakt-minimal-phone-01" alt="The white Mudita Kompakt next to the black Minimal Phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7zF7AuJyCbQ7Z8PJc2zZZk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Between the two, I far prefer the Mudita Kompakt's design. It's got a very 2000s MP3 player aesthetic with its thick plastic frame and lovely rounded corners all around. This thing feels <em>great</em> to hold, and it's diminutive size ensures that it fits in everyone's hands without feeling tiny. I was also impressed with the touch response on the phone, as some ePaper displays (like older Kindles) feel incredibly sluggish.</p><p>Mudita's OS is built on Android, but it's been stripped of <em>all</em> Google services, meaning you won't be checking your Google Calendar or tapping into Google Play Games. You can pretty easily sideload the Aurora app store and install many popular Android apps, but any that require Google services simply won't work.</p>

<p>Both devices feature an older type of E Ink display that's more commonly found on a Kindle rather than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-e-ink-tablet">best E Ink tablets</a>. The Mudita Kompakt's screen is actually a bit better than the Minimal Phone's display so far in my usage, meaning you'll see less flashing/refreshing on Mudita's phone.</p><p>But don't go into this expecting to play games or even watch some videos on it, as you can with e-readers like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/onyx-boox-palma-review">Boox Palma</a>, which feature E Ink Carta displays. Those devices are probably easier as transition devices because the refresh rate is much closer to that of an LCD or OLED panel, while these two minimalist phones are strictly designed for more static imagery.</p><p>Here's a quick video I put together showing how each looks while scrolling, so you can get a good idea.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lYOzNwUiJwE" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>All of these things add up to a <em>very</em> different experience from your average Android smartphone, and, quite frankly, it's been really hard making the transition. In some ways, I'll never be able to fully disconnect because of my job. I rely on Google services each and every day, and it's simply impossible for me to unplug from them and continue doing what I do.</p><p>But I can see the sparks of change happening slowly as I get more and more adjusted to this new lifestyle. Scrolling through social media is basically impossible on these, and it means that the only time I'll be X'ing or Instagramming is when I'm at my desk doing actual work instead of wasting time on the couch.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>If you pick one up, give yourself some grace. It's a huge change, and it's going to take time.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>And while I'd already dropped my T-Mobile SIM card into the Minimal Phone two days ago to get the full experience, I've still got my trusty <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> in my other pocket to ensure that I can get a great picture or video when the moment happens. Both phones have cameras on the back and can perform basic photography/videography, but I'm a photo snob and can't give up the modern smartphone camera.</p><p>I'd never encourage an addict to keep their temptation in their back pocket at all times, but, for now, this is the best way that I can think of to transition to a more minimalist lifestyle over time. Going cold turkey can sometimes be best, but I'm happy taking it slow and seeing where this gets me over time. If you pick one up, give yourself some grace. It's a huge change, and it's going to take time.</p>

As a result, a myriad of companies have raised prices in an attempt to counteract the higher costs. However, some companies, such as Anbernic, are halting shipments to the U.S. entirely.</p><p>Just last week, Retroid <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/order-a-retroid-pocket-mini-weve-got-bad-news" target="_blank">announced</a> that despite its best efforts, those in the U.S. who pre-ordered the Pocket Classic in Kiwi, Teal, or Berry would have to either pick a different color or cancel their orders entirely. This is due to an imposed deadline of April 25, at which point "shipping agencies will not accept U.S.-bound packages from China."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:96.30%;"><img id="KZifQ2ZmtsKgRpJe3meWS9" name="ayn-shipping-response-email" alt="Shipping update from AYN support" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KZifQ2ZmtsKgRpJe3meWS9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1080" height="1040" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYN Discord)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This was just the first domino to fall, as Anbernic has recently updated its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://anbernic.com/pages/shipping-policy" target="_blank">Shipping Policy</a> landing page. There's a notice at the top of the page that says, "Due to changes in U.S. tariff policies, we will be suspending all orders shipping from China to the United States starting today. We strongly recommend prioritizing products shipped from our U.S. warehouse."</p><p>A message recently shared on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://discord.com/channels/1014777854384414762/1328472903242743929/1363846038041006090">AYN Discord channel</a> seemingly confirmed that it, too, will be making changes. The company will continue shipping orders until April 25, "then pause for a week and try to choose a new channel for shipping after May 5th." Currently, AYN offers either DHL or 4PX for shipping, with the customer being able to choose during the checkout process.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1134px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="8jWPYXEUC5FEfVXohmYZS9" name="nintendo-switch-2-tabletop-mode-mario-kart-world-press" alt="Nintendo Switch 2 in Tabletop Mode playing Mario Kart World with Joy Cons detached" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8jWPYXEUC5FEfVXohmYZS9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1134" height="638" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nintendo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Taking a breather and going back to the drawing board seems to be the most logical move. It's something we saw Nintendo do in regards to the Switch 2 launch, after the company delayed pre-orders in the U.S. As a result, many began worrying whether the Switch 2, which is made in Vietnam, would end up being priced even higher than the $449 retail price.</p><p>Ultimately, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/nintendo-maintains-nintendo-switch-2-pricing-retail-pre-orders-to-begin-april-24-in-u-s/?srsltid=AfmBOoqXGmvaw53mzUe6MymybEDpdqOGoLvnVrGH3rkxz0vU5o5Y9ndy">Nintendo decided</a> against raising the price of the Switch 2 itself, but confirmed that "Switch 2 accessories will see price adjustments." However, there's still a chance that the Switch 2 will eventually cost more, depending on how much inventory Nintendo has on hand in its U.S. warehouses.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-this-mean-for-future-releases-2">What does this mean for future releases?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1023px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:62.07%;"><img id="nZDcJfGpDgf8RHpqFfaW4N" name="anbernic-rg557-announcement-render" alt="Anbernic RG557 press render showing the White and Transparent Purple models" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nZDcJfGpDgf8RHpqFfaW4N.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1023" height="635" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Anbernic)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Anbernic's decision to suspend shipments to the U.S. comes at an interesting time, as the company only just recently announced its latest gaming handheld, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://anbernic.com/blogs/news/anbernic-rg557-first-look">RG557</a>. However, pre-orders for the device haven't even opened yet, and we're interested to see how things will play out.</p><p>The company has warehouses in both China and the U.S., but given how quickly the tariff situation has developed, we're not sure what inventory levels might look like. Although it's unlikely, there's even a chance that Anbernic wasn't able to get any inventory into the States.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4999px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sNm28wpUrZWkGYWmonAyqY" name="ayaneo-pocket-ace-announced-5" alt="AYANEO Pocket ACE Retro Power hero" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sNm28wpUrZWkGYWmonAyqY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4999" height="2812" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYANEO)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Then there are AYANEO and OneXSugar, two companies that announced devices earlier this year but have yet to provide any availability updates. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/the-ayaneo-pocket-ace-is-compact-powerful-and-i-cant-wait">AYANEO's Pocket ACE</a> looks to be one of the most pocketable and powerful handhelds we've ever seen, utilizing the Snapdragon G3x Gen 2 and sporting a 4.5-inch display.</p><p>OneXSugar's Sugar1 is set to be one of the first devices to be powered by the new Snapdragon G3 Gen 3, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/gdc-2025-brings-about-new-qualcomm-chips-and-android-gaming-handhelds">announced at GDC 2025</a>. While flagship power is great, the real story is the dual-screen design, essentially offering a modern (and futuristic) take on the Nintendo DS.</p><p>While we're excited to see both of these gaming handhelds launched, we're also expecting to be disappointed. It wouldn't come as a shock if neither of these ended up arriving in the U.S. If they do, I suspect that we're in store for some rather high price tags.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7KpJHS5PoZ8nqGpw836PSX" name="multiple-emulators-on-s25-ultra-odin-2-pocket-dmg-z-fold-6-1" alt="Emulation on Android devices with the Galaxy S25 Ultra, AYANEO Pocket DMG, Galaxy Z Fold 6, and AYN Odin 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7KpJHS5PoZ8nqGpw836PSX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unfortunately, this entire situation is out of our hands, meaning we're just at the mercy of OEMs, shipping partners, and retailers. It also means that even if you are (or were) willing to pay the tariffs, you might end up finding an order being canceled just because you live in the U.S.</p><p>In the weeks leading up to the deadline, companies have been trying to bring as much inventory into the U.S. as they can. So it's likely that we'll see a bit of a buffer between now and when the inventory runs out. After that, all bets are off, and we simply won't know what the landscape of things will look like until the time has arrived.</p><p>Some OEMs and retailers, such as Anbernic and AliExpress, have U.S. warehouses that you can order from. Besides that, Amazon resellers are probably your next best bet. But no matter what, be prepared to pay more than what the original retail price was.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google's annual I/O event is a little under one month away, and the company has posted information that teases what's coming.</p><p>As usual, Google has posted its sessions list for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://io.google/2025/explore">scheduled conferences</a> ahead of its I/O 2025 event. One of the standout categories is Android, which the company states will hold a presentation about Material 3 Expressive, Android's "next-level" UX design. Google's brief overview explains the session will highlight its "new emotional design."</p><p>The sessions will also grant developers the design files and alpha code so they can begin preparing their apps to work with it.</p><p>Another major aspect to be talked about is "desktop windowing and stylus support." The former will be showcased as a way to help users "manage multiple tasks," while the Ink API assists with better stylus support on Android.</p><p>Google is also preparing a major announcement regarding its XR experience. Its sessions list states interested parties can learn more about Android XR, alongside information about its SDK Developer Preview evolving into a Beta during the event. Additionally, it seems Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://io.google/2025/explore/technical-session-22">will inform users</a> about the "public launch" of Android XR later this year.</p>

<p>Users can check out Google's entire planned <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://io.google/2025/explore">sessions list for I/O 2025</a> on its official website. There are plans to dive deeper into its AI, Web, and Cloud features for interested users. Google will offer insights into its latest Gemini model advancements and where it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://io.google/2025/explore/pa-keynote-18">might head next</a> with its AI software. It will then discuss the new built-in AI APIs on their way to Chrome to help with summarizing and writing content.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-io-2025-date-official">date was official</a> for Google I/O 2025 after fans solved the company's typically expected puzzle. The show will kick off on May 20 through May 21, packed with keynote streams, sessions, and more. Google says it will host demos, networking opportunities, and workshops alongside the conferences we've become accustomed to.</p><p>Devs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://io.google/2025/">can register</a> to ensure they remain in the loop until the event kicks off in May.</p><p>There's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-io-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">quite a bit we're expecting</a> from I/O 2025, like Android 16. After confirming during MWC 2025 that Android 16 would launch earlier, Google has been busy crafting its betas for testers and developers to refine the product before it arrives. The company is seemingly still on track to rollout the software sometime in June to meet its Q2 2025 target.</p><p>Moreover, as we've seen in its sessions list, Android XR is still a hot topic. There's a chance we could learn more about it during its major keynote speech on May 20. The company recently had <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-android-xr-smart-glasses-ted-2025">a TED 2025 demo</a> with Android XR-ready smart glasses. We were given a glimpse its the AI's (Gemini) "memory" capabilities to help users in their daily lives.</p>

<ul><li>Rumors now claim Samsung is not only working on One UI 8, but also an "8.5" update.</li><li>This version could bring large improvements to its next flagship trio in 2026.</li><li>Other rumors say One UI 8 (Android 16) might offer several foldable-focused updates for the Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Fold 7 this summer.</li><li>Samsung allegedly started testing One UI 8 earlier in March; however, rumors are not in sync about when users could see it launch.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Rumors suggest Samsung is not only looking ahead to its next major OS update, but it could come with even more substantial elements later on.</p><p>The latest "exclusive" rumors stem from a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sammypolice.com/exclusive-galaxy-s26-series-to-come-with-one-ui-8-5-samsung-ditches-one-ui-8-1-110/">SammyPolice</a> post, which alleges what Samsung could do with One UI 8 and a potential 8.5 patch (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/samsung-one-ui-8-5-in-progress/">Digital Trends</a>). For the former, the publication claims Samsung's One UI 8 upgrade could debut on the Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Fold 7 come launch this summer. While the software has previously been rumored to arrive "earlier than expected," the post adds there's an underlying focus on foldables.</p><p>Supposedly, One UI 8 will deliver multitasking "optimizations" for foldables and "redesigned" widgets.</p><p>This is also the first time we're hearing of a suspected "One UI 8.5," but the publication claims its evidence is solid. It states that after analyzing "Samsung's system components," it came across a reference to One UI 8.5 alongside the base iteration.</p><p>Speculation says One UI 8.5 could bring a more notable upgrade for Samsung's devices as it seemingly forgoes any potential "8.1" or "8.1.1" updates. If true, this would be a return to a software release unseen since One UI 2.5 in 2020/2021.</p>

<p>Aside from the massive One UI 7 delays we've been subjected to, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-8-sooner-after-one-ui-7-rumors">rumors of One UI 8's</a> surprise appearance started in early March. It was theorized that Samsung could skip any potential One UI 7 (minor) updates, like a 7.1 patch, and jump right into its next major iteration. These rumors were reportedly bolstered later that month when evidence of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s25-caught-testing-samsungs-upcoming-one-ui-8-android-16-update">Samsung's internal testing</a> was found.</p><p>Evidence for that discovery was a Galaxy S25 running the supposed next major release. It showed up on Geekbench, and its software showed Android 16, which makes sense considering the rumors speak of One UI 8.</p><p>It seems that Samsung is attempting to fast-track its next One UI update on account of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-beta-3-launch">Google doing the same</a>. The software achieved its "Platform Stability" milestone in mid-March, and two days ago, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-drops-android-16-beta-4-before-the-big-stable-launch-in-may">dropped Beta 4</a>. Google is sticking to its planned Q2 2025 release window, meaning we'll have between April and June for it to drop. However, signs seemingly point toward June, so we'll have to wait and see.</p><p>When it comes to One UI 8, the current line of rumors suggests we might see it on the next 2025 foldables. That points us toward July and August at the latest. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-will-bring-one-ui-8-sooner">some rumors</a> think an "early fall" launch could suit it. Take these rumors with a grain of salt for now.</p>

<p>Wherever you live, your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses</a> will get a significant boost in smarts this week. And Meta is also tempting new customers with a stylish new set of Skyler Shiny Chalky Gray frames, while expanding to a few new countries.</p><p>Starting in the United States and Canada, you'll be able to say, "Hey Meta, start Live AI," and have the Meta AI "see what you see continuously and converse with you more naturally," similar to Gemini Live except that you get hands-free insights into what you're doing.</p><p>Live AI <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-glasses-just-got-their-most-futuristic-ai-update-yet">rolled out to Early Access</a> last December, but is "coming soon" for general availability, suggesting Meta thinks it's ready for widespread use. Meta suggests you try use cases like asking for help on recipe steps while you cook or holding an in-depth conversation about a landmark, without needing to ask "Hey Meta" before every question.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FUQBYtcKssnyUTHYUer6MQ" name="Ray-Ban-Meta-smart-glasses-skyler-photo-1" alt="A photo of a model wearing Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses in the Skyler Shiny Chalky Gray style" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FUQBYtcKssnyUTHYUer6MQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Live AI will let you look at a grocery store item and ask Meta about its nutritional value or what to cook with it. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Live Translation is also leaving Early Access, so all Ray-Ban users will be able to hold inter-language conversations between English, French, Italian, and Spanish by saying "Hey Meta, start live translation." This should be available with the latest update.</p><p>You can currently send messages or call folks via Messenger or WhatsApp on your smart glasses; now, Meta is adding Instagram to the list with the same messaging and audio/ video calling capabilities.</p>
<p>Outside of North America, many European users don't have access to key Meta AI smarts, but that's about to change. Meta says that next week, EU users will be able to ask Meta AI about what they're looking at and get contextual responses. They won't have access to the new Live AI tools, however.</p><p>Last week, Meta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-ray-ban-smart-glasses-natural-ai-app-expansion-update">rolled out an update</a> that gave EU users access to music streaming apps like Spotify and Apple Music, as well as new voices designed to be "more natural and lifelike." Now, Meta will let EU users ask about what music they're currently listening to — though only if English is your default language.</p><p>Meta is expanding Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses sales to India, Mexico, and the United Arab Emirates. This should bring the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/help/ai-glasses/4961066940605960/">total number of supported countries to 18</a>.</p>

<p>Prospective Ray-Ban Meta buyers have new styles and lens color combos to choose from today. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/ai-glasses/skyler-shiny-chalky-gray-sapphire-transitions">Skyler Shiny Chalky Gray glasses</a> have a unique style and Transitions lenses so they can work indoors for people with a prescription.</p><p>If you prefer something a little less flashy, the Skyler Shiny Black frames now come with G15 Green or clear lenses for the first time. And there are many other Headliner and Wayfarer frames available, too.</p><p>All Ray-Ban Meta glasses have a 12MP camera, 32GB of storage for photos and videos, built-in mics and speakers, and hours of battery life.

<ul><li>Samsung and LG have joined the bandwagon in suing/arguing India's new "floor pricing" policy for companies looking to recycle e-waste.</li><li>Court documents show India wants to introduce a "minimum payment" of 22 rupees (~25 cents U.S.) per kilogram.</li><li>Samsung states this change would be roughly "5-15 times the price currently paid."</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung is reportedly drawing attention to a policy change overseas regarding a wide range of e-waste.</p><p>Specifically, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/lg-samsung-sue-indian-government-over-electronic-waste-pricing-policy-2025-04-21/">Reuters</a> states Samsung is joined by LG are suing/arguing India's newly refined pricing policy behind big companies attempting to recycle their technology (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-sues-indian-government-over-e-waste-policy-mandating-higher-payments/">SamMobile</a>). India is reportedly demanding "higher payouts" for companies looking to take care of e-waste responsibly.</p><p>For India's reasoning, the publication cites a statement from its court filings (not public), which says, "only 43% of the country's e-waste last year was recycled and at least 80% of the sector comprises informal scrap dealers." To rectify this, New Delhi proposes a "minimum payment" of 22 rupees (~25 cents U.S.) per kilogram to recycle consumer appliance waste.</p><p>This is what the country is calling a "fixed floor payment;" however, tech companies like Samsung and LG argue that this will benefit the recyclers more than solving the true issue.</p><p>While Samsung reportedly stated the proposed pricing plan was "5-15 times the price currently paid," others suggest India's pricing change could "triple" expenses for recycling e-waste. Meanwhile, the publication cites an LG statement that says "fleecing companies and taxing them" won't help India achieve its goal.</p>

<p>E-waste is a hot topic for companies in places all over the world, especially where the market is huge. Take the EU, for example, which mandated that all smartphone batteries <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/eu-mandates-replaceable-batteries-2027">should be removable/replaceable</a> by the consumer by 2027. The European Council adopted a new rule across the region in mid-2023, stating OEMs must shift toward this new mentality to improve the amount of battery waste.</p><p>The region also ruled that producers should seek to collect 63% of portable battery waste by 2027. Moreover, the collection of lithium portable battery waste should hit 80% by 2031.</p><p>Of course, consumers can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ask-jerry-where-can-i-recycle-my-phone">do their part to recycle their old devices</a> or ones that may have broken. More often than not, folks in the U.S. can take their rundown devices to stores like Best Buy or Home Depot and have them recycle the items appropriately. It's worth noting that not everyone will have the same options available, so you might have to do a little research.</p><p>A rule of thumb would be to ask any place that sells devices about potential recycling spots.</p>

You also get 8GB of RAM, some pretty decent cameras, and all of the latest Galaxy AI features. </p><p>The only problem is that the phone now faces some stiff competition in the form of devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">Google Pixel 9a</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a>. So which of these midrange beauties is the best choice?</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yh8JjcV7jgdAuw7vkdunzL" name="samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-mint-in-hand.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy S24 FE in hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yh8JjcV7jgdAuw7vkdunzL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Starting at $499.99, Google&apos;s latest midrange masterpiece boasts better battery life than the S24 FE — and it ships with Android 15 — but the "Fan Edition" Samsung device is otherwise a better and more powerful phone. Without any discounts, choosing between the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-vs-samsung-galaxy-s24-fe">S24 FE vs the Pixel 9a</a> would be a pretty tough decision, but thanks to this price drop, the S24 FE is a no-brainer.</p><p>Things get a little more complicated when you compare the S24 FE with the OnePlus 13R, however, namely because the latter phone features a better display, battery life, and 256GB of base storage. It&apos;s also not too difficult to find <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/oneplus-13r-256gb-unlocked-nebula-noir/6609358.p"><strong>a deal that knocks the OnePlus 13R to $499.99</strong></a>. With that being said, I still give the Galaxy S24 FE the edge, but that&apos;s only because the Samsung phone gives you seven years of OS and security upgrades straight out of the box, which means you could be enjoying the "Fan Edition" experience for many years to come.</p>

<p>Samsung has again resumed the much-awaited One UI 7 stable release after putting a halt early last week. Although the company resumed by the end of the same week, more devices and older Galaxy handsets across regions are finally seeing the update.</p><p>While the Galaxy S25 series already shipped with One UI 7 and also received the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/samsung-rolls-out-april-2025-update-for-galaxy-s25-series">April update</a>, the predecessors were long overdue in getting the update. The company started rolling out the update early this month, with multiple delays, even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/serious-bug-pushes-samsung-to-stall-one-ui-7-rollout-globally">pausing the update</a> for a while, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s24-series-one-ui-7-rollout-continues-new-build">resuming it again</a>.</p>

<p>During the course, however, some regions like India and Germany haven't seen the update hit the Galaxy S24 series. And thankfully, this time, Galaxy S24 Ultra in India (including my handset) has finally seen the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a>-based <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review">One UI 7</a> stable update today (Apr 23). It is a sizable 5.4GB update and it further includes the April security patch as well.</p><p>Not just India, but the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> users in Egypt, Kenya, Mauritius, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, and more have started getting the update, per subreddits spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-resumes-one-ui-7-rollout-3547123/">Android Authority</a>. Further, several Galaxy S24 users on Reddit and Samsung Community have also confirmed the stable release, including handset owners on T-Mobile and Boost Mobile carriers.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung has been working with marine researchers across three regions, helping them restore and study coral reefs for the past year, as a part of its initiative "Coral in Focus." It partnered with Seatrees, a nonprofit organization that has been working on identifying new ways to restore coral ecosystems.</p><p>In a detailed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/coral-in-focus-samsung-marks-one-year-of-marine-ecosystem-restoration-with-galaxy-technology">post</a>, the company revealed that scientists have been using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-ultra-one-month-later">Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>'s "Ocean Mode" instead of bulky underwater camera equipment to capture vivid pictures of coral reefs in Fiji, Indonesia, and the United States.</p><p>This camera feature, exclusively developed for the coral reef project, significantly reduces blue tones in pictures, which are prominent in underwater photography. Additionally, this feature also minimizes the blurring of images during movement, "optimized by shutter speed and multi-frame image processing." Potentially reducing the challenges that people face when capturing images underwater.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:49.10%;"><img id="TMA9a2CkaMb8arQicPTdgD" name="Samsung-Coral-in-Focus" alt="Ocean Mode on Samsung S24 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TMA9a2CkaMb8arQicPTdgD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="491" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Ocean Mode also helps with capturing multiple shots at a pre-set time interval, instead of having the user manually press the shutter button each time they want to click an image, which could turn out to be very tedious when underwater.</p><p>This mode allows the user to pre-set the time, the number of images that need to be captured, and all they have to do is click on the shutter button once. The phone will then click a series of images that are essential for researchers when creating accurate 3D models of these reefs.</p><p>It's important to note that this feature isn't available on the standard Galaxy S24 Ultra devices on the market.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:32.90%;"><img id="h4ZLJJavddAys6wQG2vegD" name="Samsung-Coral-in-Focus" alt="Ocean Mode on Samsung S24 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h4ZLJJavddAys6wQG2vegD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="329" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This has helped marine researchers produce "seventeen 3D models of coral reefs to analyze the health and growth of reefs." And a total of 11,046 coral fragments were planted to restore 10,705 square meters of coral reef habitat, which is roughly the size of 25 basketball courts, Samsung added.</p><p>This automated photography approach not only saves time but also ensures that each shot delivers accurate images of these coral reefs, contributing to effective analysis of these tiny aquatic animals.</p><p>This project is a part of Samsung's broader "Galaxy for the Planet" initiative that was started in 2021. Samsung has also been recycling discarded fishing nets and incorporating the material into its smartphones since the Galaxy S22 series.</p>

In many cases, savvy shoppers can buy new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Samsung Galaxy S24 series</a> phones at prices lower than what Samsung is offering with its refurbished devices.</p><p>We've done the hard work for you, finding the best deals that put <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Samsung's Certified Re-newed offers</a> to shame.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-perks-of-going-with-a-samsung-refurbished-unit-2">What are the perks of going with a Samsung refurbished unit?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="yFmLhsbp8G89X6TVQ6Twh5" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-plus-ultra-family-purple-01.jpg" alt="The Galaxy S24 family including the smaller Galaxy S24, larger Galaxy S24 Plus, and premium Galaxy S24 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yFmLhsbp8G89X6TVQ6Twh5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are certainly advantages to buying a Galaxy phone through the Certified Re-newed program. For starters, all refurbished Galaxy devices sold by Samsung get a brand-new OEM battery, which is more than most third-party refurbishers offer.</p><p>You also get "the same one-year limited warranty offered on new smartphones," according to the company. While some other renewed devices might claim to offer warranties for their products, only ones sold by reputable brands — like Samsung and Best Buy — can truly be trusted. Even Amazon's Renewed program merely offers a 90-day blanket return policy, but nothing thereafter.</p><p>For added protection, you can purchase the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-care-plus-vs-applecare-plus">Samsung Care Plus</a> plan with the optional Theft & Loss add-on, which is available for new Galaxy devices but not third-party refurbished ones.</p><p>Is that enough to sway you toward a refurbished Galaxy S24 from Samsung. Maybe, but the prices will probably leave a sour taste in your mouth:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Samsung Galaxy S24, Black, 128GB:</strong> $620 ($799 MRSP)</li><li><strong>Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus, Black, 256GB:</strong> $800 ($999 MSRP)</li><li><strong>Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus, Black, 256GB:</strong> $1,020 ($1,299 MSRP)</li></ul>
<p>Those prices would be passable if the Samsung Galaxy S24 lineup was still new, but it isn't. The Galaxy S25 series is here, and it has taken over. So, if you buy a phone through Samsung's Certified Re-newed program, you're getting a year-old phone and one that's been refurbished for only a slight discount.</p>
<h2 id="oh-and-you-can-buy-new-galaxy-s24-phones-for-cheaper-2">Oh, and you can buy new Galaxy S24 phones for cheaper</h2>
<p>The egregious part of Samsung's refurbished pricing model is that you can purchase brand-new Galaxy S24 units for cheaper than the Certified Re-newed units.</p><p>If you do want a refurbished device, you can save even more by going with a third-party program like Amazon Renewed or Best Buy Geek Squad Refurbished. We've already pointed out the potential downsides of going with a third-party refurbisher, but both Amazon and Best Buy offer free returns. If anything is awry, you can always play it safe and return the refurbished device for a full refund.</p><p>But again, the key thing to remember is that you don't have to go with a refurbished device to save. We found a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Unlocked-Android-Cameras/dp/B0D51S487S/" target="_blank">brand-new Galaxy S24 Ultra on Amazon for just $880</a> and it's unlocked. That's $140 less than Samsung's Certified Re-newed Galaxy S24 Ultra and about $420 less than the device at MSRP.</p>

<p>There are plenty of reasons you might want to be part of the Samsung Certified Re-newed program — the biggest of them being that you help save the planet by reducing e-waste. However, Samsung made buying refurbished a tough decision by setting Galaxy S24 prices way too high. For reference, they're higher than <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-certified-re-newed">the Galaxy S23 refurbished prices announced</a> on the same date last year by between $30 and $100.</p><p>So, if you're intrigued by the refurbished Galaxy S24 models, consider grabbing a new model from a third-party retailer instead. Or, if you're dead-set on getting a new battery, one-year limited warranty, and Samsung Care Plus overage, perhaps the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 series</a> is a better value for only a few hundred dollars more.</p>

<p>It's no secret that Spotify is one of the most popular music streaming platforms. Here at our Android Central, our team members largely favor Spotify over YouTube Music for the most part, myself included. The main draw is, of course, the spectacular Jam feature, which is enough to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/switching-from-youtube-music-to-spotify">woo YouTube Music loyalists</a> such as our managing editor Derrek Lee even.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify-jam-sessions-announcement">Launched in September 2023</a>, Jam continues to be Spotify's unique selling point, despite the addition of several new features and tools to the platform since. As it stands, I don't want Spotify to release new options like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify-likely-to-introduce-music-pro-add-on-tier-in-2025">premium tiers</a>. Instead, I wish Spotify would augment Jam sessions with features like comments and reactions. Here's why.</p>
<h2 id="the-social-element-sets-spotify-jam-apart-2">The social element sets Spotify Jam apart</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="XtVSA4tmHrw35aUrusHhCX" name="tribit-stormbox-flow-12.jpg" alt="Tribit StormBox Flow with phone next to it running Spotify" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XtVSA4tmHrw35aUrusHhCX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What I love about Spotify Jam is the social element it adds to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">music streaming</a> experience. An individual starts a Jam session and shares it with friends, who can all create a playlist and listen together.</p><p>This is useful in gatherings like parties and hangouts, but also if you're in a long-distance relationship or just looking to chill with those dear to you remotely. There are even more fun interpretations of this feature that you may not have considered.</p><p>For instance, I went on a short island getaway with my partner and close friends a few months back. We took an eight-hour bus ride to the jetty point together. Now normally, if it was private transport we'd blast music all along the way with everyone contributing to the Jam.</p><p>To avoid disturbing other passengers, we all put on headphones or earbuds and had a private Jam session going, like a silent rave that didn't bother anyone around us. Everyone was queuing songs, making requests or discussing each other's song choices on the group chat.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>What I love about Spotify Jam is the social element it adds to the music streaming experience.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Another friend of mine uses Spotify Jam to spend quality time with his girlfriend while she's on vacation with her family, thousands of kilometers away from him. Time zones might separate them, but something as simple as a Jam helps them feel close to each other and share special moments.</p><p>Even in the midst of work, studies, or workouts at the gym, they communicate by starting a Jam together and simply adding songs they would like the other to try out, or maybe to convey a feeling or thought.</p>
<h2 id="spotify-should-add-social-features-like-notes-comments-and-reactions-to-jam-sessions-2">Spotify should add social features like notes, comments, and reactions to Jam sessions</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4654px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yV6UbV7GLa5oDRF6JrvgsK" name="spotify-wrapped-2024-pixel-9-pro-fold" alt="Andrew's Spotify Wrapped 2024 on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yV6UbV7GLa5oDRF6JrvgsK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4654" height="2618" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I'm sure there are many others out there who use Spotify Jam for its social aspect, to connect with others via music. Spotify should really augment this feature for such users.</p><p>Imagine, being able to add short comments to a Jam session, like users do on timestamps during tracks on SoundCloud. You could highlight your favorite part of a track that your partner shared with you or leave questions for friends in the Jam to answer.</p><p>Think how fun it would be to attach voice notes at the start of a song to explain something, add fun facts, or maybe even dedicate that song to a specific person who is part of the Jam.</p><p>Reactions would also be a welcome addition to Spotify Jam sessions. The fun chaos of having friends with drastically different music tastes means that you can facilitate dialogue, expand your preferences, and simply enjoy learning something new about someone. Naturally, being able to react to songs on a Jam playlist would enhance such experiences, generate friendly banter, and potentially create memorable moments that other music streaming platforms could never.</p><p>By bringing interactive features like these to Jam sessions, Spotify has the potential to become even better than it already is and maybe even redefine what a music streaming app should be capable of.</p>

<ul><li>Strava's new Performance Predictions tab uses your recent run stats to estimate how quickly you can finish popular race distances.</li><li>You must run at least 20 tracked activities across the past 24 weeks to see predictions for your 5K, 10K, half marathon, and marathon times.</li><li>Other fitness brands like Garmin and COROS offer race predictor tools, too.</li><li>Strava's new performance tool is available now for paid subscribers on Android and iOS.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Strava's push to cater more strongly to runners continued this week with Performance Predictions, a machine learning-based model for predicting your race times based on your "current fitness level."</p><p>After <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://press.strava.com/articles/strava-to-acquire-runna-a-leading-running-training-app">acquiring Runna last week</a>, Strava will now help runners "take the guesswork out of race-day planning" by suggesting what pace you can expect to hit in ideal conditions — meaning "a flat course, similar to a track" — for a 5K, 10K, half marathon, or full marathon.</p><p>To see these Strava Performance Predictions, you must have uploaded at least 20 run activities across the last 24 weeks, enough for Strava's ML model to have "sufficient data to make a high-quality and accurate prediction."</p><p>Strava isn't the first brand to offer race predictions based on your stats. Garmin and COROS both have a Race Predictor widget, while Polar calls it a Running Index. In each case, they take stats like your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-i-boosted-my-vo2-max-score-on-my-garmin-watch">VO2 Max</a>, maximal heart rate, the pace and frequency of your last few weeks of workouts, your current stamina level, and other key stats to suggest your optimal capabilities.</p><p>But Strava says that its methodology — which uses "100 athlete data attributes" — is better than other brands.</p>
<h2 id="how-strava-performance-predictions-work-2">How Strava Performance Predictions work</h2>
<p>"Unlike other race predictors that rely on theoretical inputs like estimated VO2 Max, Strava only uses real activity data to predict race results," Strava's Performance Predictor explainer page claims.</p><p>Strava compares the "performances of athletes with similar training histories" to predict your capabilities; it says this makes your estimates more "realistic" because other comparable athletes achieved these times first.</p><p>Its four race predictions are independent: If your training "emphasizes speed and power," you'll see more 5K and 10K gains, while "running more weekly volume and focusing on longer intervals" will help your marathon times but <em>not</em> your 5K time. I'm looking forward to testing this with some track workouts and long runs in the future.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:39.95%;"><img id="Pw6i2qGX92oogz2bty5uUZ" name="performance-predictions-press-hero" alt="A press screenshot of the new Strava Performance Predictions widget in the Strava app, showing the user's estimated 5K, 10K, half marathon, and marathon times, as well as arrows showing how they've changed since the last estimates." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Pw6i2qGX92oogz2bty5uUZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="1598" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Strava)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Your predicted times will be found in the You tab of the Strava app, and they'll update to the latest estimate "after each run upload" or after three days without an upload. If you stop uploading enough runs, Strava will cache its last, best race estimates with the old data and wait for you to resume running.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/strava-announces-stable-athlete-intelligence-anti-cheating-and-flyover-sharing">Strava's Athlete Intelligence</a> is best known for analyzing individual workout quality against a 30-day estimate. Performance Predictions is an exciting tool because it uses your data for proactive suggestions of what you are capable of or a race time you should strive to beat.</p><p>When I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/strava-interview-athlete-intelligence-inaccurate-gps-race-leaderboards-and-more">interviewed Strava's execs about the future of Athlete Intelligence</a>, CTO Rob Terrell told me that they wanted to make Strava more "forward-looking," rather than fully reactive to how you choose to run. Performance Predictions definitely falls into a new category for the app.</p>

<p>On paper, Garmin's Race Predictor uses similar data to Strava's new service, like "trends in your training load and mileage data," including "special consideration of all different types and frequencies of runs you performed." And every run I've made with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a> since 2022 has uploaded to Strava, so they have the same data.</p><p>So it's intriguing that Garmin has a much more <em>optimistic</em> outlook on my running capabilities than Strava.</p><p>The 5K and 10K gap isn't that large; Garmin says I can finish them 62 and 82 seconds faster than Strava's predictions, respectively. But the half-marathon difference is almost five minutes (1:50 vs. 1:45), and Garmin is bullish on me running a sub-4 hour marathon (3:52) while Strava has a more pessimistic guess (4:17).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="cHMutNYi2uAvLzfm7ZCZNY" name="Garmin-Race-Predictor-charts" alt="The Garmin Connect Race Predictor widget showing the author's predicted race times over the last year." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cHMutNYi2uAvLzfm7ZCZNY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Race Predictor widget in Garmin Connect </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For context, I ran a 1:47 half marathon last month, but my mileage has fallen off in April with a lot of hilly runs. Garmin seems to think I'm capable of a faster PR with the right course and perfect conditioning, while Strava seems to be holding my dip in mileage against me to say I wouldn't do as well today.</p><p>It's hard to say which is right, in other words, but both are reasonable benchmarks.</p><p>As for the marathon predictions, I ran a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/what-i-learned-running-20-mile-race-wearing-four-watches">20-miler last November</a> in 3:10 where I struggled to keep running for the final five miles. I'd like to say I'm in better shape since then, but I'm not any more prepared to run a full 26 miles yet. I'd say Strava's 4:17 estimate is the only realistic one, as I could probably drag my body another six miles at a 13-minute pace. No <em>way</em> I'm hitting 3:52; sorry Garmin!</p><p>In terms of overall presentation, Strava's Performance Predictions page is a little bare-bones; it could probably use an option to see longer-term changes in race estimates, like Garmin offers. And eventually, I'd like to see Strava offer some kind of workout <em>suggestions</em> for how to lower your race times, but since Strava and Runna are staying as separate services (for now), I don't know if Strava has any plans for that.</p><p>If you're a Garmin user and Strava subscriber, go ahead and compare your Strava Performance Predictions against Garmin's guesstimates, and let me know which you think is more accurate!</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-82">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Samsung Wallet is testing out two exciting features: 'Buy Now, Pay Later' and 'Tap to Transfer,' with a potential U.S. launch on the horizon.</li><li>The 'Instant Installment' feature lets you split payments for purchases, while 'Tap to Transfer' works like Apple’s Tap to Cash but with more flexibility for other digital wallets.</li><li>The BNPL feature, powered by Splitit, will let you use Visa or Mastercard without a credit check, though activation may require approval and could have extra fees.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A fresh beta build has given us a sneak peek at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-wallet-buy-now-pay-later-early-access-trial-spotted">Samsung Wallet’s "buy now, pay later"</a> and tap-to-send options, and although these are not official yet, all signs point to these features rolling out soon.</p><p>When the Galaxy S25 series made its debut in January, Samsung also snuck in some software updates that flew under the radar. Two standout features were “Instant Installment” for breaking up payments and a peer-to-peer money transfer option that Samsung calls “Tap to Transfer.”</p><p>Samsung’s Tap to Transfer works a lot like Apple’s Tap to Cash—just bump phones to send money. However, while Apple keeps things locked in its ecosystem, Samsung is presumably playing nice with other digital wallets. That means you might not need a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Galaxy phone</a> to receive cash, giving it a flexibility Apple doesn’t offer.</p>
<h2 id="buy-now-stress-later-2">Buy now, stress later</h2>
<p>Now, leaked screenshots of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung/what-is-samsung-digital-wallet">Samsung Wallet</a>, shared by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/theordysm/status/1913895538203705533" target="_blank">@theordysm on X</a>, show a “Buy Now, Pay Later” feature in the works, powered by Splitit (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/04/21/samsung-wallet-leak-early-glimpse-two-features/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). It looks like it’ll work with Visa and Mastercard, with no credit check needed. That said, activation still needs approval, and there might be some extra fees in the mix.</p><p>Both features are still in the testing phase, going through internal checks and limited beta runs. Word on the street is Samsung might launch them first in the U.S. once they’re ready for primetime.</p>

<p>From the screenshots, it looks like the Installment Payments feature will let users split their purchases into weekly payments. This option should be available for pretty much any transaction made through Samsung Wallet.</p>
<h2 id="slice-your-bills-2">Slice your bills</h2>
<p>Samsung’s installment payments aren’t about offering credit or loans. Think of it as turning your regular purchases into a pay-over-time plan, whether you’re checking out online or in a physical store.</p><p>The funds transfer feature lets users send money either through a digital network or by tapping an NFC-compatible device or payment card. The recipient’s bank account, linked to their debit card, gets the funds straight away.</p><p>While we don’t know exactly how fast the transfers will be, the ability to send money just by tapping a debit card is definitely a game changer.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>With over 13 million devices sold, there's no question that Synology is the biggest manufacturer of NAS systems globally. But this category has changed quite significantly in the last 15 months; UGREEN made its grand debut with the introduction of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/ugreen-dxp4800-plus-nas-review">DXP4800 Plus</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/ugreen-nasync-dxp2800-review">DXP2800</a>, delivering sturdy designs with terrific hardware. <br><br>TerraMaster and ASUSTOR also did a much better job last year, polishing their software and overhauling their product lines to deliver better differentiation. By contrast, Synology had a quiet year and a half, with the brand's older models — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/synology-diskstation-ds923-plus-long-term-review">DiskStation DS923+</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/synology-diskstation-ds224-plus-review">DS224+</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/synology-diskstation-ds723-review">DS723+</a> — doing most of the heavy lifting. <br><br>Thankfully, that's changing with the debut of the DiskStation DS925+. The successor to the best-selling DS923+ shares the same design, but it comes with dual 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet ports as standard, and it has upgraded internals thanks to a quad-core Ryzen V1500B. It has four standard drive bays in addition to dual M.2 slots, and you can use SSDs to store data in addition to caching.</p>
<ul><li><strong>NAS deals: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=nas"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.newegg.com/p/pl?d=nas"><u><strong>Newegg</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/searchpage.jsp?st=nas"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/search?q=nas%20storage"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a></li></ul>
<p>However, the launch isn't without controversy; with the DiskStation DS925+, Synology is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/synology-brings-severe-hard-drive-limitations-to-diskstation-models-and-im-pissed">limiting its Plus models to its own hard drives</a>, so you can't use Seagate's IronWolf, Exos, or Western Digital's Red Plus HDDs with the NAS. While this restriction came into effect on the brand's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/heres-why-synology-switched-validated-disks-enterprise-nas-enclosures">business models four years ago</a>, it confirmed at the time that consumer models won't be affected — that's clearly not the case now. <br><br>So if you've been using an older NAS model and are considering an upgrade, this is what you need to know about the DiskStation DS925+.</p>

<p>Synology unveiled the DiskStation DS925+ in select Asian markets on April 23, with a global launch slated for May 2025. That's when the NAS will be available in the U.S., U.K., and other western markets. Interestingly, the DS925+ is debuting in countries like India, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan ahead of the brand's home market, Taiwan. <br><br>Given that retail availability varies in individual regions, Synology didn't share what the NAS costs in most countries. It will retail for ₹65,205 ($763) in India, which is a smidgen costlier than the ₹62,500 ($731) that the DS923+ costs in the country. The pricing indicates the DS925+ will slot in at roughly the same $599 figure as its predecessor in the U.S., but it isn't unlikely to think it might go up to $649 (or higher) given the tariffs situation.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="pLuJ2555cYDjnzkzbBfdxM" name="Synology DiskStation DS925+" alt="Synology DiskStation DS925+ NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pLuJ2555cYDjnzkzbBfdxM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Synology hasn't changed its design in nearly 10 years, so if you've used any of the brand's NAS servers in the past, you'll feel right at home with the DiskStation DS925+. The NAS has a black aesthetic with good ventilation — both active and passive — and the unassuming design allows it to blend in with ease.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="AVnuuixm8rck22jtmAjmeM" name="Synology DiskStation DS925+" alt="Synology DiskStation DS925+ NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AVnuuixm8rck22jtmAjmeM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The sides have a ventilated design that lets air into the chassis, and the NAS has the same dimensions as its predecessor. Build quality is great, and I haven't really seen any issues with any of the brand's NAS servers in the last 10 years. The DS925+ uses an external power brick, and it's able to go up to 120W. It doesn't use anywhere close to that in real use though, and the NAS has two 92mm fans at the back that are quiet even under load.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="vh7C5BgCfTuZScq27o6azM" name="Synology DiskStation DS925+" alt="Synology DiskStation DS925+ NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vh7C5BgCfTuZScq27o6azM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I used the NAS in my office, and I didn't have any problems with noise levels even with heavy use. The front has the standard drive bays, and you can easily install 3.5-inch HDDs without any tools; the individual bays can also be locked, and there's a USB-A port on the right. Other than that, you get the usual power button at the bottom, and the LEDs that indicate system, HDD, and LAN status.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="PyVQ9x27XYbRbpErT3hGsM" name="Synology DiskStation DS925+" alt="Synology DiskStation DS925+ NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PyVQ9x27XYbRbpErT3hGsM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The big talking point with the internals is that the DiskStation DS925+ gets dual 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet ports. With every other brand making the switch to 2.5GbE and 10GbE years ago, the DiskStation DS923+ was notable for its use of Gigabit ports, and thankfully, that's not a problem on the DS925+.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5159px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="nu38puRJJyG9tGf69WoEpM" name="Synology DiskStation DS925+" alt="Synology DiskStation DS925+ NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nu38puRJJyG9tGf69WoEpM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5159" height="2906" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The NAS is powered by a quad-core Ryzen V1500B platform; it has better headroom overall, and the difference is noticeable even in daily use. The NAS still comes with just 4GB of RAM out of the box, and while that's enough for most tasks, you'll need to slot in another module if you intend to use Docker. Most NAS servers in this segment have at least 8GB of RAM as standard, so it's a little shortsighted that the DS925+ is hobbled in this area.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="imPhnkdEduhqTJ38DRfM6N" name="Synology DiskStation DS925+" alt="Synology DiskStation DS925+ NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/imPhnkdEduhqTJ38DRfM6N.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You still get two M.2 slots on the underside, and they can be used to house M.2 2280 SSDs. The SSDs can be used to store data, and you can easily create storage pools. A notable uptick this time is a USB-C port at the back; this is used to expand drive bays down the line, and works with the new DX525 unit. This is a positive move as the older eSATA connector was clearly showing its age.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-synology-diskstation-ds925-performance"><span>Synology DiskStation DS925+: Performance</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1022px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.46%;"><img id="ZjWJHGZEhW7989aLVD36Mj" name="Synology DiskStation DS925+" alt="Synology DiskStation DS925+ HDD limitation" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZjWJHGZEhW7989aLVD36Mj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1022" height="577" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I've been testing Synology NAS servers for nearly 10 years now, and in that time, I predominantly used Seagate's IronWolf and WD Red drives. When setting up the DS925+, I slotted in two 6TB IronWolf drives as I usually do with all NAS reviews, but it wouldn't even install DiskStation Manager (DSM). I got a dialog box noting the drives were unrecognized, and that I had to do a manual install — which wasn't possible as I was testing the NAS under embargo. <br><br>For reasons I don't follow, Synology chose to enforce the use of its own hard drives in consumer DiskStation models — which is exactly what it said it wouldn't do in 2021. The brand says it conducted "rigorous testing" with its HAT3300, HAT3310, HAT5300, and HAT5310 drives, and using that as the reason to lock down the DS925+ to just these drives.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="yPdZJyBBCUZykNFKiMK78M" name="Synology DiskStation DS925+" alt="Synology DiskStation DS925+ NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yPdZJyBBCUZykNFKiMK78M.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It also notes that its drives deliver "higher reliability," but doesn't provide any details as to how they're better than Seagate's Exos drives — my go-to choice right now. Then there's the issue with pricing; in broad strokes, Synology's drives are considerably costlier than their immediate rivals. To give you some context, Seagate's terrific 24TB Exos X24 drive is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Exos-Enterprise-Internal-Drive/dp/B0CM293XCL">down to $479</a> right now, and while Synology doesn't have a 24TB drive, the 20TB HAT5310 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.newegg.com/synology-hat5310-20t-20tb-for-nas-systems-7200-rpm/p/N82E16822108845">retails for $719</a>, a premium of 34% while providing less storage. <br><br>Are you getting anything that justifies the added cost? No. Synology's HAT5310 has the same warranty as Seagate's Exos X24, the same 2.5 million hours mean time between failure (MTBF), and identical 550TB/year endurance. There's no meaningful gains to be had, and you're ultimately paying more to get less storage.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5169px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.34%;"><img id="Erk9bQhkhUpT298GBrXN4M" name="Synology DiskStation DS925+" alt="Synology DiskStation DS925+ NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Erk9bQhkhUpT298GBrXN4M.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5169" height="2912" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Basically, the move is designed to lock users into the brand's ecosystem, and not being able to use IronWolf, Exos, or WD Red drives is a huge limitation. That said, if you're migrating from an older NAS and using the same drives, then there's no issue — I tested this IronWolf drives taken from the DS224+, and it booted without a problem. But if you're setting up a new NAS and want to use Seagate, Western Digital, or any other drives, that's just not possible. <br><br>There is a workaround to add Seagate and WD drives to the verified list, and this is what I've been doing on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/i-set-up-the-ultimate-home-nas-with-over-100tb-of-storage">DiskStation DS1823xs+</a> for nearly a year now. But that isn't possible with the DS925+, as it doesn't even allow you to create a storage pool and install DSM unless you're using a Synology hard drive. This policy is true when it comes to M.2 drives as well, so you can't use any other SSD other than the brand's own limited choices. This move will lose the brand a lot of loyal users, and the worst part is that Synology is just using relabeled Toshiba drives.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="FQECVFQ3ZMNb92huzgmGnM" name="Synology DiskStation DS925+" alt="Synology DiskStation DS925+ NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FQECVFQ3ZMNb92huzgmGnM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I had to switch to HAT3000 and HAT3310 drives to install the web-based DSM 7.2 interface and test the DS925+. It was straightforward after moving to the brand's drives, and setting up DSM took under 10 minutes. If you're coming from an older model, the interface itself will be familiar; the visuals are identical, and the only difference I noticed is that the DS925+ is better at launching containers. <br><br>A big allure with Synology's NAS systems is the software, and DSM 7.2 continues to lead the way in this regard. The interface is clean, has plenty of customizable utilities, and has an exhaustive list of useful services. I use Synology Photos daily to back up photos and videos automatically from all my phones, and it is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-transfer-google-photos-synology-photos">viable alternative to Google Photos</a>. Synology's software suite has a good design, tight integration with mobile platforms — both iOS and Android — and it covers the essentials.</p>
<p>Whether you need to store photos and videos, share documents, have a local productivity suite, custom mail server, host a website, or use a text editor, DSM 7.2 has you covered. And if there isn't anything available as standard, you can just use Docker to create a container. <br><br>The best use case with the DS925+ is media streaming, and it does a terrific job as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-nas-plex">Plex media server</a>. The Ryzen V1500B platform doesn't have hardware transcoding, and if you don't care about that, there's plenty to like. It handles 4K high bitrate content without breaking a sweat, and I didn't run into any issues whatsoever — it proved to be just as reliable as the DS923+. <br><br>Where the brand has a distinct advantage is with its mobile clients; Synology does a better job than just about every other manufacturer in this area, and it's extremely easy to view and manage the data on your NAS while on the go. This is still the biggest differentiator, and why I continue to use the DS1823xs+ as my main NAS system.</p>

<p>UGREEN's DXP4800 Plus is my go-to choice these days if you need a 4-bay Plex NAS server. The NAS <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-DXP4800-Plus-Attached-Diskless/dp/B0D22JRHZB">retails for $594</a> as of writing, and it has powerful hardware, 8GB of RAM, M.2 slots, and 10GbE in addition to 2.5GbE connectivity. While the hardware is arguably better than the DS925+, the software doesn't quite measure up to DSM, but UGREEN has shown that it is interested in building out the ecosystem. The bonus is that you don't have any restrictions on what drives you can use, or even what software you can install — it's easy to switch to TrueNAS Scale. <br><br>If you need even better hardware, TerraMaster's F4-424 Max gets my vote. The NAS is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/TERRAMASTER-F4-424-Max-NAS-Storage/dp/B0DB2MF2F9">costly at $899</a>, but you get a 10-core 12th Gen Intel Core i5 1235U, 8GB of RAM, and dual 10GbE connectivity. There are two M.2 slots as well, and the NAS is a Plex powerhouse like no other. The TOS 6 software is a definite move in the right direction, and while it's lacking some polish, you get most utilities as standard, and TerraMaster is doing a decent enough job with its mobile clients.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-synology-diskstation-ds925-should-you-buy-it"><span>Synology DiskStation DS925+: Should you buy it?</span></h3>

<p><strong>You should buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a 4-bay NAS with the best software</li><li>You want a high-end Plex server</li><li>You need 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You want to use Seagate or WD Red drives</li><li>You want 10GbE connectivity</li></ul>
<p>I'm conflicted when it comes to the DiskStation DS925+; the NAS finally brings upgrades that have been overdue, but it does so at the cost of other limitations. Having to use Synology's drives is a big pain point, and it doesn't make much sense. There's no end-user benefit to enforcing this rule, and it ultimately curbs what is an otherwise great NAS. It's clear that the brand's hubris got in the way of clear-headed strategy, and it is bound to pay the price as a result. <br><br>At the end of the day, if you're used to Synology and want a familiar interface and don't mind buying the brand's hard drives — they cost more than their rival IronWolf and WD Red options — the DiskStation DS925+ is still a great option. But if you don't want to go down this route (understandably), there are better choices available. <br><br>Synology could have pulled off a move like this two years ago, but the NAS ecosystem has changed drastically in the intervening time, and there's no shortage of standout products in the market now. If you need to upgrade, I'd suggest getting the UGREEN DXP4800 Plus. It has better hardware, and while the software isn't as good as DSM 7.2, you can easily install TrueNAS, and there are absolutely no limitations.</p>

<p>Google Fi is celebrating 10 years of its inception on Tuesday (Apr 22), and has announced a new affordable plan alongside some enhancements to its existing plans.</p><p>The new plan is dubbed Unlimited Essentials, and as the name implies, it covers the essentials of a carrier plan — like giving users unlimited calls, texts, and data — with 30GB of high-speed data for the U.S. region. The search giant announced through a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/google-fi-wireless/10-years-unlimited-essentials/">blog post</a> that one connection will cost $35 per month.</p><p>While that makes it the entry-level offering of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-fi">Google Fi</a>, the other unlimited plans are also getting some love for the existing price. For instance, the Simply Unlimited plan is now dubbed Unlimited Standard and gives users 50GB of data, a significant bump from 35 GB. It also includes 25GB of hotspot tethering, which is up from 5 GB. Additionally, the consumers also get coverage in Canada and Mexico, alongside having full connectivity on select smartwatches.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wu9ApEepSBF5fZjs75gpKo" name="Google-Pixel-7-Google-Fi.jpg" alt="Google Fi on a Google Pixel 7 at Google's Fall 2022 event" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wu9ApEepSBF5fZjs75gpKo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Chris Wedel / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Similarly, Unlimited Plus is renamed to Unlimited Premium, which comprises 100GB of data, up from 50 GB. Plus, 50GB of high-speed hotspot tethering is also included. Other perks of the plan include six months of YouTube Premium, 100GB of Google One cloud storage, and connectivity for tablets and laptops without any additional cost.</p><p>Google has also announced that it is broadening its access to its data-only SIMs to data-only eSIMs, which means users “can quickly and easily connect newer, eSIM-compatible devices like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablets</a> and iPads with data on the go, without needing a physical SIM card.”</p><p>Google Fi 5G international coverage is expanding to more than 92 global destinations for users on the Unlimited Premium and Flexible plans. And, the company is doubling the 5G network by adding 54 countries, which makes it available on iPhones, next to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>.</p>

<p>In the coming weeks, iPhone users can listen to voicemails directly on the phone app instead of the Fi app for those on the Google Fi network.</p><p>The 10th anniversary celebrations of Google Fi don’t stop there, as the company is also launching limited-time promotions for new and existing Fi users.</p><p>“For new customers, we're offering the Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel Watch 3 on us. You’ll get $300 off the Pixel 9 Pro instantly and the remaining $699 back over 24 monthly bill credits. After the phone ships, we’ll email you a code for Pixel Watch 3 to get $100 off instantly and $349 back over 24 monthly bill credits. This offer is available until April 29, or while supplies last.”</p><p>Existing customers, on the other hand, will get even deeper instant rebate discounts across all Pixel 9 series phones. Users can check their Fi account for these new offers.</p>

<p>OpenAI would be willing to buy Google's Chrome browser if a court orders its buyout, said Nick Turley, OpenAI's ChatGPT chief, on Tuesday. Turley was asked to testify by the Department of Justice (DOJ) as part of Google's antitrust trial that is expected to go on for the next three weeks (as reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-22/openai-would-buy-google-s-chrome-browser-chatgpt-chief-says?srnd=phx-technology&sref=HrWXCALa">Bloomberg</a>).</p><p>“Yes, we would, as would many other parties,” Turley said when he was asked if the company would be interested in buying Chrome.</p><p>The judge presiding over this case, Amit Mehta, determined last year that Google is violating antitrust laws by monopolizing the search market.</p><p>As a part of the remedy to even out the playing field for other competitors in the market, the DOJ has proposed that Google sell off its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-browsers">web browser</a>, and maybe even Android. The DOJ argues that splitting up these key assets is the only way to fix the problem of Google's monopoly.</p>

<p>Bloomberg reports that Turley stated that having Chrome more integrated into OpenAI would enhance the product in many ways. “You could offer a really incredible experience," he said. OpenAI could “have the ability to introduce users into what an AI-first experience looks like.”</p><p>Turley even stated that despite being Apple's first choice of AI, OpenAI is facing a lot of difficulties when it comes to getting its foot in the door with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android smartphones</a>, considering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google's Gemini</a> resides in most of these phones.</p><p>Speaking of difficulty, ChatGPT's chief stated that they're worried OpenAI might be shut out by tech giants like Google, which rule the market. "We have powerful competitors who control the access points for how people discover products, including our product. People discover via a browser or an app store,” he said.</p><p>On the flip side, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-assistant/google-disagrees-with-u-s-judges-ruling">disagrees</a> and argues that Google Search and its products have been the obvious first choice for many users, and forcing users to use alternative browsers or search engines could make it tough for them to reach Google's services.</p>

<p>Earlier today, Google's VP <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-paid-samsung-hefty-amounts-of-money-to-preinstall-gemini">confirmed</a> that the company has been paying Samsung to preinstall Gemini on its devices. This payment contract is set for two years and provides fixed monthly payments that began in January 2024. Defending itself, Google's VP said other companies like Microsoft, Meta, and OpenAI have all approached Samsung with "competitive offers" to make their AI a default on its devices.</p><p>Google said it has amended the above contract with Samsung to allow it to offer other AI apps within its devices if it chooses to do so.</p><p>That said, Google makes the most money YoY only from Search and other advertising (in Q3 2024, it reached $49.39 billion) and it would make things extremely challenging for potential buyers. That said, if Google is pushed by the judge to do so, then it would bring about a significant shift in the way we interact with Google and its products. It remains to be seen how things will play out in the next three weeks.</p>

<ul><li>Instagram launches its own video editing app dubbed "Edits" globally to all Android and iOS users.</li><li>The app has advanced editing tools like clip-level precision, along with creative tools like green screen and AI image animation.</li><li>This app allows creators to see real-time stats, like viewer engagement on Reels, to help them understand if their reel was a hit or a miss.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Instagram has launched its new video editing app today (April 22) to all Android and iOS users globally. The Edits app brings with it a whole host of free editing features, along with creative tools that will help creators make reels and edit on the go, without having to switch between other editing apps and Instagram.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/instagram-tries-to-capitalize-on-tiktok-uncertainty-with-new-edits-app">Edits app was teased</a> by Instagram head Adam Mosseri back in January when TikTok and its parent company, ByteDance, which also owns a video Editing app called CapCut, were made <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tiktok-wechat-be-banned-us-app-stores-sunday-september-20">unavailable</a> in the U.S. for a brief period.</p><p>Meta wanted to capitalize by launching a CapCut-like Edits app to its users, just as it chose to launch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/instagram-threads-now-live">Threads</a> after Elon Musk took over X (previously Twitter). After a two-month delay from its original February launch target, the Edits app has finally arrived.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:63.00%;"><img id="5fzNn2WEshXavwyd4v3K2X" name="Instagram-Edits" alt="Edits for Insta" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5fzNn2WEshXavwyd4v3K2X.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="400" height="252" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The app streamlines the editing process for creators by giving them access to tools that can adjust video resolution, frame rate, and dynamic range in a video.</p><p>Much like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/instagram-bringing-recommendations-reset-button">Instagram</a>, the Edits app also has various fonts and dynamic text animations with customizable colors that can be added to videos. Additionally, users can access licensed music, sound effects, voiceovers, and video filters to enhance the overall look and sound of their Reel.</p><p>The app description indicates that users can enhance audio to make voices clearer and remove background noise, as well. Plus, Edits gives creators access to additional tools like touch-up, green screen, and AI image animation to help them bring their ideas to life.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="USCeVpmditWdt6NZ7UixeF" name="Instagram-Edits" alt="Instagram Edits launches" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/USCeVpmditWdt6NZ7UixeF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What sets Edits apart is that it gives creators a live dashboard where they get to see real-time insights on how their videos are performing online, with stats including engagement, clicks, and average view duration. This helps creators gauge whether their idea meshed with followers or if they have to change their strategy for future content.</p><p>The Edits app doesn't leave any watermarks behind when you export or save an edited video through the app, making it easy for users to share videos on competing social media platforms.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://creators.instagram.com/edits?locale=en_US#features">Edits</a> app is free and is available for download via the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.instagram.basel&hl=en_US">Play Store</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/edits-an-instagram-app/id6738967378">App Store</a>.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>This week, Meta launched a new Meta Quest store page revealing the top-50 best-selling games of all time on the platform. I was tipped off to it yesterday when one of my favorite VR games, Walkabout Mini Golf, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Mighty_Coconut/status/1914334146006077844">posted on X</a> about being the 20th best-selling game of all time on the Quest. Funny enough, Walkabout shares one common trait with 80% of all games on the list.</p><p>But it's not the type of game that's the trait, nor is it the price of the games or their complexity. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/section/1377690143243672/">The official list</a> actually sports a <em>ton</em> of variety, with all but maybe one major genre not represented (strategy games).</p><p>No, instead, I noticed that only 11 out of the top-50 games were part of an already-established franchise: Among Us, Five Nights at Freddy's, Resident Evil, The Room, Angry Birds, Fruit Ninja, The Walking Dead, and four Star Wars games. And most of these were original spin-offs, with only a few ports.</p><p>Nearly 80% of the best-selling Meta Quest games of all time are from names you've never heard of if you don't have a VR headset. While that could be worrisome for some players, I think it's a very good thing.</p>

<p>Years ago, I wrote about how big publishers ignoring VR <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/vr-doesnt-need-big-publishers-they-ruin-everything-anyway">was a good thing</a>. These companies often don't care about gaming as an art and are only in it to make millions of dollars. Take <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/assassins-creed-nexus-vr-review">Assassin's Creed Nexus</a>, for example, which has made Ubisoft <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ubisoft-sales-expectations-assassins-creed-vr">several million dollars</a> and saw an uptick in sales around the release of Assassin's Creed Shadows. Despite making quite a bit of money for the company, it didn't land on the top-50 list.</p><p>Notably, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/metro-awakening-review">Metro Awakening</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/batman-arkham-shadow-review">Batman Arkham Shadow</a>, and even the recently-released <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/alien-rogue-incursion-meta-quest-3-review">Alien: Rogue Incursion</a> aren't on there, either. In fact, the only games on the list that would fit a more traditional definition of a AAA game are The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners, Resident Evil 4, and Arizona Sunshine. Compare that with the list of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/category/174cdc0a-cdf3-4970-821e-2d33fee97b4e/1">best-selling PlayStation 5 games</a>, which includes franchises and names everyone in the world knows.</p><p>That all plays in quite nicely with the narrative that "there's no money in VR gaming" among big publishers, but the reality is that this couldn't be further from the truth. What appears to be the case is that AAA games don't sell boatloads of copies on the Quest platform, but that doesn't mean they don't make good money.</p>

<p>Looking at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/section/400089879848137/">top-earning games of the week</a> shows what I'm talking about. The top-3 titles are all free-to-play games, which have driven <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/the-good-and-bad-of-meta-quest-growth-in-2024">the biggest revenue growth</a> on the platform in recent months, but below that, you'll find many of the AAA games I listed above.</p><p>The Walking Dead, Alien, and Assassin's Creed are all in the weekly top 50, and while these games certainly seem to be doing well for themselves, there aren't many <em>other</em> games of this caliber on the list.</p><p>If anything, this proves the point that VR gamers are putting on headsets to try something new and exciting, not just to rehash the games they've been playing for years (or decades). As VR continues to grow in 2025 and developers find new and unique ways to immerse gamers, it's clear that the most original games that take advantage of the medium's strengths — perhaps like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/vr-games/dimensional-double-shift-hexas-job-simulator-multiplayer">Dimensional Double Shift</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/orion-drift-is-the-new-echo-vr">Orion Drift</a> — are the ones that will end up on the top-50 bestseller list far into the future.</p>

<ul><li>YouTube Music is testing a feature to share song lyrics on social media, similar to Spotify.</li><li>Users can select specific lyrics, choose a color palette, and share them as Instagram Stories or download them as images.</li><li>The feature appears to be a part of the streaming platform's efforts to improve user engagement and compete with other music services.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>YouTube Music is quite popular amongst music streaming services, and it is now gaining yet another popular feature from its rival Spotif,y and is currently being tested on the platform.</p><p>It is the ability to share lyrics to your favorite ones through social channels like Instagram. A Reddit user (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/AssembleDebug">AssembleDebug</a>) has recently spotted the feature and it works pretty similar to what <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/spotify">Spotify</a> has been offering for quite a while now.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Youtube Music is rolling out the lyrics sharing feature which I spotted back in January 👀 https://t.co/9RKwzcKMzX pic.twitter.com/4vMO8o9a95<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1914531019660689690">April 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music-review">YouTube Music</a> already offers lyrics for songs that can be accessed from the Now Playing section of the music streaming app. As per the video shared by the Reddit user, once the upcoming feature goes live, users will be able to select specific lines from the lyrics.</p><p>Users can then find a new Next button followed by the new Share button after the preferred lyrics selection, and hitting it would open a share sheet with social icons like Instagram. However, they can be shared as Instagram Stories, per the video, and more social handles are expected to be added once the official rollout of the feature begins.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/YoutubeMusic/comments/1k4uhbw/looks_like_you_can_now_share_lyrics">Looks like you can now share lyrics!</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/YoutubeMusic">r/YoutubeMusic</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>YouTube Music users are already familiar with sharing their favourite tracks to Instagram, Instagram Stories, and even Snapchat. The new lyrics sharing feature is also identical to the prior and additionally users also get to choose colour palette as well so that selected lyrics appear more fancy in social handles. Alternatively, there is also an option to download as an image.</p><p>It is encouraging to see YouTube Music catching up to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">competition</a> in bringing new features, and it should likely become more engaging. And this should make users who shuffle between apps and have such a feature, could add another reason for such people to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/switching-from-youtube-music-to-spotify">go back to YouTube Music</a> from services like Spotify.</p><p>Early this year, YouTube Music has also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-music-is-giving-artist-pages-a-slick-new-makeover">started testing</a> giving artist pages a makeover and the popular audio/video switch button <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-music-testing-shifting-of-audio-video-switcher-button">rearrangement</a> has also seen in the works. All these suggested features could be on the verge of rolling out later this year.</p>

<ul><li>Google has rolled out its Earth Day Doodle for 2025, and it's giving users a glimpse at the many sides of our world.</li><li>Each letter that spells "Google" is given a different environment/ecosystem from somewhere in the world, with info on its rich natural history.</li><li>In 2022, Google gave users a saddening look at how climate change has ravaged our world and changed many of its most beautiful places.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Earth Day has returned once again, and Google is celebrating by rolling out a new doodle in Search to commemorate our big blue ball in space.</p><p>The company announced the appearance of its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://doodles.google/doodle/earth-day-2025/">Earth Day 2025 Doodle</a> in Search in a press release earlier this morning (Apr. 22). Google states its doodle this year features a different snapshot per letter that spells out its name. Each snapshot gives us a clear look at "several breathtaking images from Google Earth from across the globe."</p><p>Each letter has a story, and Google says that all begins with the first letter in its name, "G."</p><p>The first letter is designed in the image of the Maldives. Google states this little features twenty ring-shaped coral formations known as "atolls." Moving on to the first "O," the post states the image seen represents the high-altitude alpine landscape of the Hautes-Alps in the French Alps. The "harsh conditions" of this particular environment features a diverse wildlife that lets adventurous visitors glimpse chamois, marmots, and golden eagles.</p><p>The second "O" is a snapshot of the rugged and tough Côte-Nord from Quebec. This stretch is land is "untamed" as its ecosystem is chock-full of plants and animals tough enough to survive its subarctic air. The second "G" takes us to South America and into Argentina's western Mendoza Province. This semi-arid region contains a collection of rivers that all stem from the country's mountains.</p>
<h2 id="an-ode-to-our-only-home-2">An Ode to our only Home</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:40.00%;"><img id="34RbHt65rU5UAFX8J8tHVi" name="google-earth-day-doodle-2025" alt="Google's Earth Day Doodle for 2025 is a collection of snapshots from different climates and environments around the world." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/34RbHt65rU5UAFX8J8tHVi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="200" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Airbus, Data SIO, NOAA, Landsat / Corpernicus)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The "L" in Google brings us into the States — specifically, Utah. Southeast Utah is put on full display in the company's Earth Day Doodle as we see how tectonic movements have impacted this corner of the Colorado Plateau. While there are deep canyons carved by the Colorado River, desert plants around Lake Powell showcase nature's ability to adapt, even in rough arid climates.</p><p>Lastly, the "E" takes us down to Australia to glimpse the remote inland area of western New South Wales. A harsh climate indeed, Google states drought-resistant plants like the spinifex and eucalyptus thrive here. Moreover, wildlife has become accustomed to this rough way of living as they roam gently across the land.</p><p>While Google's 2025 Earth Day Doodle is lighter, showing us the many looks of our wonderful planet, its 2022 version <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-earth-timelapse-doodle-earth-day-2022">was pretty sad</a>. Instead of a standard drawing, 2022's doodle was a GIF that showed how climate change has affected our planet. Each timelapse lasted for multiple hours, and new glimpses were shown throughout the day.</p><p>Users were able to see how destroyed our ice peaks have become, as well as how lush, green forests were destroyed in a matter of years. Even the coral reefs in Australia weren't immune to the human element, as they've suffered rapid bleaching over the years.</p>

<ul><li>A recent rumor claims Samsung is working on adding onto its Galaxy Tab S10 series with a "Tab S10 Lite."</li><li>This "Lite" version could see a more affordable price tag (under the Tab S10 FE) and sport a two-year-old Exynos SoC.</li><li>A tipster states Samsung might also shake-up its Galaxy Tab S11 series by removing its Plus model, instead.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Rumors have reportedly surfaced about the potential future of Samsung's Galaxy Tab series.</p><p>The rumors, which stem from tipster AssembleDebug and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-tab-s11-ultra-s10-lite-soc-leak-3546807/">Android Authority</a>, claim Samsung is working on adding an extra tablet to its Galaxy Tab S10 series. Supposedly, there's evidence that points toward an upcoming "Galaxy Tab S10 Lite." Of course, with the idea of a "Lite" device, we're immediately thinking of a more affordable device — and the leaks seem to agree.</p><p>The tipster claims that the alleged Tab S10 Lite could feature Samsung's two-year-old <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-exynos-1380-launch">Exynos 1380 5G</a> processor. The chip was originally designed for midrange devices and was paired with the Arm Mali G68 GPU for gaming purposes back in 2023. The chip could also support 144Hz refresh rate displays up to Full HD Plus resolution.</p><p>Additionally, the post highlights leaked code that claims the S10 Lite could feature cellular and Wi-Fi connectivity variants for consumers.</p>

<p>Looking to the future, there's a chance Samsung could shake up the next Galaxy Tab series (in a different way). The publication alleges the Korean OEM could drop the Galaxy Tab S11 Plus from the lineup. If true, that would leave us with a base Tab S11 and Tab S11 Ultra.</p><p>What's more, rumors claim the company could pop MediaTek's flagship <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-announces-dimensity-9400-flagship-chip">Dimensity 9400</a> into both tablets.</p><p>Little else is known about either of these rumors; specifically, display sizes and other important specs to think about. Regarding the Tab S10 Lite rumor, we have the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-fe-and-s10-fe-plus-launched">Galaxy Tab S10 FE launch</a> to (maybe) give us an idea of what we could see. On the surface, the device wasn't anything to write home about. While the Tab S10 FE Plus offers a larger 13.1-inch display (12% bigger than its predecessor) and loads of AI improvements, the device falls behind in its camerawork.</p><p>Elsewhere, the publication assumes the alleged Tab S10 Lite could see a slightly lower price tag than the recent FE models. For context, the Tab S10 FE Plus and base S10 FE launched with a $499 and $649 price tag, respectively.</p><p>When the flagship Galaxy Tab S10 series launched last year, we were <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/hey-samsung-wheres-the-galaxy-tab-s10">already short one device</a>: the base model. It made for a slightly confusing release, especially when you consider the series started at $1,000. Users weren't granted a slightly smaller Tab S10 in late 2024, as the entry-level size was 12.4 inches.</p><p>With Samsung supposedly looking to give users a more compact size before ramping things up, we might end up confused all over again.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google is in the thick of a new federal trial after being accused of breaking <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/us-doj-could-break-up-google-following-ruling">antitrust</a> laws in the tech space by the Justice Department.  Now, new information has come to light. According to the DOJ (Department of Justice) lawyer David Dahlquist, Google has been paying "enormous sums of money" to Samsung every month since January 2024 (as first reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-21/google-doj-go-back-to-court-to-fight-over-search-monopoly-fix?sref=HrWXCALa">Bloomberg</a>).</p><p>This amount, though not revealed has is being paid to the Korean OEM in installments for preinstalling Google's AI app, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-live-is-available-for-free-on-android-phones">Gemini</a>, onto its devices. The publication further notes  that Google's VP of  platforms and device partnerships, Peter Fitzgerald, confirmed in his testimony that the payment contract is set for two years, with monthly payments going out for each device that preinstalls Gemini</p><p>The contract states that Google will pay Samsung a percentage of the revenue Google earns from advertisements within the Gemini app.</p>

<p>This isn't the first time that Google was found to be paying Samsung to preinstall ap on their devices. The tech giant <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2023/11/google-paid-samsung-8-billion-dollars-to-samsung-default-apps.html">paid Samsung $8 billion</a> to default Google Play Store, Assistant, and Search between 2020-2023.</p><p>Bloomberg states that Judge Amit Mehta, who is overseeing this case, found out last year about the practice of paying companies to set their apps as default on Samsung phones—a clear violation of the antitrust laws.</p><p>The DOJ, which built this case against Google, has put forth remedies that will potentially bar Google from paying partners for its search engine to be the default. This could also be stretched to Google’s AI products, including Gemini, which the DOJ has found to also monopolize the market.</p>

<p>In response to these allegations, Fitzgerald stated that other companies like Microsoft, Meta and OpenAI have all approached Samsung with "competitive offers," to make their AI a default on its devices.</p><p>“We took into consideration what was being offered by competitors,” Fitzgerald said. He also stated in court that Google has made amends to the agreement, which will allow Samsung to offer other AI apps within its devices if it chooses to do so. Additionally, Google removed its prerequisite of having Samsung exclusively pre-install  <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-search-is-getting-a-unified-domain-for-us-and-global-users">Google Search </a>and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/new-google-assistant-now-available-canada-uk-and-more">Assistant</a>.</p>

<p>That said, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sammyguru.com/google-is-paying-samsung-a-huge-sum-every-month-to-pre-install-gemini-on-galaxy-devices/">internal documents</a> that were revealed in the trial state that Google could extend the said contract until 2028, making Gemini an exclusive AI platform on future Galaxy devices. This could lead to other AI companies being left behind and Samsung users favoring Gemini over the rest of the apps, considering it comes preinstalled with their phones, creating an anticompetitive environment.</p><p>However, the DOJ also aims to nip this in the bud,<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-assistant/google-disagrees-with-u-s-judges-ruling"> has asked Google</a> to separate Chrome from Android, and wants the company to sell Chrome. It also suggested splitting Android from Google Search and Play without forcing a sell-off. If things don't go in Google's favor during the trial, it could potentially change the way users interact with Google's products, as well as how tech companies collaborate.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/fairphone-5-ifixit-perfect-repairability-score">Fairphone</a> has released its 2024 Impact Report which shows the things the company has done to live up to its reputation as an ethical, eco-friendly, and progressive electronics manufacturer.</p><p>The report is full of good news and shows how Fairphone has worked to improve and change how electronics are made. Throughout 2024, the company has reduced its CO2 emissions by 48% (compared to the 2022 report), became 100% e-waste neutral, expanded its list of impact materials, and gave out over $1 million dollars to supply chain workers as part of the company's Living Wage Bonus.</p>
<p>To top it off, it did all these things while experiencing a 3% growth while the overall market is stagnant. You can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fairphone.com/en/2025/04/17/our-2024-impact-report-is-out-here-are-the-highlights/" target="_blank">read through the report here</a> and learn more about these highlights as well as see everything the company has done to try to change the system.</p><p>I will admit <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-wish-the-fairphone-5-was-coming-to-the-us">I love what Fairphone is doing</a> and how they are doing it. It's extremely difficult to design and manufacture tech products that people want to buy, and making sure they will have a long support life and be serviceable makes it even harder.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:970px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.19%;"><img id="2yL9UrsD7riKRTNDkBaMNE" name="fairphone-4.jpg" alt="Fairphone 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2yL9UrsD7riKRTNDkBaMNE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="970" height="545" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The company even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/fairphone-fairbuds-user-replaceable-parts-launch">offers earbuds that have replaceable batteries</a> and that's something you simply can't find from anyone else. There are products out there with better specs, but you won't find one that's more friendly to the planet we live on and is built to last the way Fairphone's are.</p>
<p>The problem is that Fairphone can't fix or change anything on its own. Setting a goal like making sure you recycle an equal amount of material for each product you sell and meeting it is awesome, and seeing Fairphone able to do it is amazing. But this is just a drop in the bucket.</p><p>In 2024 Fairphone sold 103,053 smartphones. 103 thousand is a lot of anything, but Apple sells that many on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone launch day</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-shipped-more-phones-than-anyone-else-in-q1-2024">Samsung sells</a> that many over a good weekend. This is where the real change has to happen.</p>
<p>Being realistic, Apple and Samsung could never do the things a small company like Fairphone can. And I know both companies are trying to be producers of ethical and eco-friendly products. The ideas are there, it's the reality of pulling it off that gets in the way.</p><p>Imagine Apple giving out living wage bonuses to cobalt miners or assemblers. Or Samsung selling a million phones and recycling a million others to keep balance. Words like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-becomes-first-tech-giant-be-100-percent-carbon-neutral">carbon neutral</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung/samsung-new-environmental-strategy">zero emissions</a> are grand, and both companies are working towards those goals, but it's also time to see smaller, yet equally effective changes.</p><p>If Fairphone can build a phone that will last you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/fairphone-3-gets-android-13-update">at least five years</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-true-wireless-headphones">Bluetooth earbuds</a> with replaceable batteries in each <em>and</em> the case, so can Apple or Samsung. Why aren't they?</p><p>You have to love seeing what Fairphone is doing and I think all of us wish them continued success. We also have to ask the tech giants the hard questions about why a tiny company from the Netherlands is doing what they can't.</p>

<hr>
<p>Asus is here for springtime with a couple of new Chromebooks and Chromebook Plus additions that walk the affordable line.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://press.asus.com/news/press-releases/asus-chromebook-cx14-cx15-stylish-eco-conscious-design-enhanced-performance/">press release</a>, the Taiwanese company announced the new Asus Chromebook Plus CX14 and CX15. The CX15 series is the larger of the duo of laptops coming from the Asus kitchen, as it sports a 15.6-inch FHD display with 300nits of peak brightness and the Intel Core 3 N355​ CPU. Asus states this screen offers a "wide-viewing-angle" with an 87% screen-to-body ratio for a more immersive and full experience.</p><p>The post also highlights the laptop's 180-degree hinge. This will let consumers flip their CX15 laptop into more "versatile" positions alongside the available touchscreen option.</p><p>What's more, Asus draws attention to the wealth of Google AI features present in its CX15 Chromebook Plus model. Not only will users find tools to help with creativity and productivity, but the company highlights 12 months of Google One AI Premium "at no extra cost" when purchasing the device. Users gain Gemini Advanced, 2TB of Cloud storage, and more.</p><p>If you're taking video calls, the CX15 Chromebook Plus delivers AI-powered features to enhance your camera's clarity and reduce your audio's background noise.</p>

<p>Asus is pushing the idea of a tough, affordable Chromebook Plus with the CX15. The model has been met with MIL-STD-810H US military-grade standard certification, meaning it can take some bumps. Moreover, the laptop has been outfitted with a redesigned bottom cover. Now, with four screws implemented, consumers can disassemble the bottom of the laptop to reach its components easily if there's an issue.</p><p>Consumers can quickly hook up a secondary (external) monitor using the laptop's HDMI port.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, we have the Asus CX14 Chromebook Plus, which mirrors the capabilities of the CX15 version. One of its main differences is that it offers a slightly smaller 14-inch FHD display, but users continue to receive the same built-in Google AI features and more.</p><p>The company offers base CX14 and CX15 Chromebooks with a 14-inch and 15.6-inch FHD display, respectively. It doesn't appear that the base models offer Google's AI built-in, so users will have to look at the Chromebook Plus offerings instead. The same military-grade toughness and removable bottom cover are featured on the base CX14 and CX15 laptops, too.</p><p>Asus states its laptops are available in seven chic colors: Quiet Blue, Fabric Blue, Pure Grey, Misty Grey, Misty Green, Cream Pink, and Rock Grey. However, there are three different finishes users can choose, depending on which model they've purchased.</p><p>The press release did not state the exact pricing of the latest Asus Chromebooks and Chromebook Plus models; however, it highlights their "affordable" tag. More information should become available soon.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025">Motorola Razr 2025 lineup</a> is expected to be officially revealed this week, on April 24, 2025, according to past teasers. Ahead of that date, the Motorola Razr 2025's promotional materials have leaked courtesy of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/1914512702325592316" target="_blank">Evan Blass</a>, revealing every angle of the upcoming flip-style foldable. The Razr 2025, called the Razr 60 in non-U.S. markets, is expected to be the cheapest of the flip phones in Motorola's 2025 series.</p><p>The promotional images reveal at least three Motorola Razr 2025 colors, including a sleek navy blue colorway with what appears to be a carbon-fiber-style finish and texture. The photos also show off a green finish with both light and darker tones, plus another colorway somewhere between silver and tan.</p><p>The latter color is only shown off via its side profile, making it unclear what exactly this finish will look like or be called.

<p>Official <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/official-motorola-razr-2025-teaser-clip">social media teasers from Motorola</a> revealed the apparent launch date for the Razr 2025, which is set for April 24. This is significantly earlier than Motorola's launch of the Razr 2024 and Razr Plus 2024 last year.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/major-motorola-razr-plus-2025-leak-hardware-changes">Per the latest rumors and leaks</a>, the regular Razr 2025 is set to keep its general form factor, while the Plus model is expected to pick up a few major upgrades. The Motorola Razr Plus 2025 could get a faster chip, bigger screen, and better main camera sensor. All the upgrades will be officially revealed later this week.</p>

<ul><li>Google is reportedly exploring a move for Pixel production from Vietnam to India.</li><li>It is also claimed to be interested in localizing certain Pixel components, like enclosures or fingerprint sensors, to Indian manufacturing plants.</li><li>The move is said to be related to the ongoing U.S. tariff situation, which is expected to levy higher charges on goods imported from Vietnam than India.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The U.S. is currently exploring tariffs under the Trump administration that would directly impact products imported to the country, and the uncertain situation may be pushing Google to ramp up Pixel manufacturing in India. Google is reportedly considering moving the production of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel phone</a> components from Vietnam to India to thwart potentially-major tariffs, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/electronics/alphabet-inc-shifts-google-pixel-production-from-vietnam-to-india-amid-us-tariff-concerns/articleshow/120496733.cms" target="_blank">The Economic Times</a>.</p><p>The report claims that Google is in talks with Dixon Technologies and Foxconn to move parts of Pixel production to India, "especially devices headed for the U.S." The news comes via two industry executives who spoke to The Economic Times, saying that discussions started about two weeks ago. These talks would be the first step in transitioning parts of Pixel production from Vietnam to India, which could be a large undertaking.</p><p>However, there appears to be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/could-we-be-the-reason-for-google-increasing-its-phone-prices">major financial incentive for Google</a> and its partners to make a move. While goods imported to the U.S. from Vietnam — where most Pixel phone production takes place — are subject to a 46% tariff, those imported from India are only subject to a 26% tariff. It's worth noting that both tariffs, called reciprocal tariffs, are currently paused for 90 days and are not in effect.</p>

<p>The situation is currently ongoing and subject to change, with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi meeting with U.S. Vice President JD Vance as recently as yesterday, April 21, attempting to reach a trade deal that avoids reciprocal tariffs. Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that India hopes to reach a trade deal with the U.S. by this fall, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/india/indias-modi-host-jd-vance-delhi-under-us-tariffs-shadow-2025-04-21/" target="_blank">Reuters</a>. The U.S. is the country's largest trading partner.</p><p>As such, there may be even greater incentive for Google to relocate some aspects of Pixel production from Vietnam to India. Specifically, the company is reportedly interested in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-has-reportedly-finished-designing-the-pixel-10s-custom-tensor-g5-soc">creating certain components</a> in the country. These could include "enclosures, chargers, fingerprint sensors and batteries," per the Economic Times report.</p><p>Currently, even Pixel phones manufactured in India are using components mostly imported from foreign countries.</p>

<hr>
<p>While several Galaxy phone users in some regions still await the One UI 7 update, a new leak has revealed some of the new features that Samsung’s next operating system, the One UI 8, is bringing to the table.</p><p>One UI 8 has been spotted in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s25-caught-testing-samsungs-upcoming-one-ui-8-android-16-update">several instances</a> over the past few weeks, and the latest leak has revealed Samsung’s new native weather app and enhanced design elements that it is bringing to the Galaxy users (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/04/22/one-ui-8-weather-app/">9to5Google</a>). An X user, Gerwin van Giessen, has shared a couple of screenshots of the One UI 8 Weather app alongside a Reddit user who has shared the app in action.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Samsung's new weather app looks very interesting. Thank you @Feruzbek_101 for sharing the original apk. This is an .apk that should be able to be installed on any device: https://t.co/n8B4s0xeU1#Samsung #OneUI #OneUI8 pic.twitter.com/7VOBzryefi<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1914525340585623846">April 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>The most notable change is the new 3D avatars that react to the forecast. While the previous iterations gave a flat look to the avatar animation, the One UI 8 weather app adds a 3D look, which certainly appears interesting. Alongside the 3D look, the avatars also carry certain elements like a jacket, a cap, or an umbrella, which also look more enhanced and complement the forecast than before, and appear pretty cool to look at.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oneui/comments/1k50g98/one_ui_8_weather_app">One UI 8 Weather app</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oneui">r/oneui</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>The animations while sliding through other aspects of the One UI 8 app also appear to be improved over the current model. Alongside the avatars, the background also appears realistic with beautiful landscapes, which is a new addition. However, most of the categories and data points look similar to the current version of the native Weather app.</p><p>It is still unclear why Samsung hasn’t included the new weather app in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review">One UI 7</a> despite bringing numerous changes to the operating system. And the One UI 7 rollout, on the other hand, has been kind of wonky as Samsung has begun rolling out the update as promised early this month, but only for certain regions like Korea, the U.S., and the U.K. Meanwhile, Galaxy S24 series users in regions like India and Germany are still waiting for the much-anticipated One UI 7 update.</p>
