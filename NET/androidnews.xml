That’s about to change, as an upcoming update is adding a search bar, making it way easier to track down the exact image you need without endless scrolling.</p><p>As per a report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/photo-picker-search-bar-rolling-out-3574489/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, Google is giving Android’s Photo Picker an overhaul with a handy search feature to help you find pictures faster. On top of that, a new date scrubber is in the works, so scrolling through endless photos will be a whole lot easier.</p><p>The Photo Picker is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-photo-picker-gains-cloud-media-app-support">all about keeping your privacy intact</a> by letting you pick just the photos, GIFs, or videos you actually want to share, without handing apps full access to your entire gallery.</p><p>Unlike the old system, it puts you in control, cutting the risk of apps snooping through your personal stuff.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:45.00%;"><img id="rvH2VdtexyUtjWpSNA4eMA" name="Photo-picker-search-bar" alt="new search bar in Android photo picker" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rvH2VdtexyUtjWpSNA4eMA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While the Photo Picker is great at keeping your pictures and videos private, let’s not pretend it wasn’t missing some basics. Top of the list, for example, is the lack of a search bar.</p><p>If you’ve ever had to dig through a mess of random images just to find that one screenshot, you know the struggle. That’s why finally getting a search tool feels less like a new feature and more like a long-awaited fix.</p><h2 id="gradual-rollout-2">Gradual rollout</h2><p>Google seems to be quietly rolling out the new Photo Picker search feature to a small group of users. Once it hits your device, you’ll spot a new search bar sitting right above the Photos and Collections tabs. It works kind of like the basic search in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos</a>, with just a quick way to find shots of certain people or scenes without digging forever.</p><p>Tap the new search bar, type in a keyword, and you’re looking at the photo you need. This feels like a throwback to the early Google Photos days, before all the fancy AI tools.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The 6000mAh battery easily lasts two days between charges, and the camera takes better photos than last year. The switch to Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 unlocks much better performance, and you get 256GB UFS 4.0 storage on the base model. The software is much more optimized this time around, and you don't get the same fluidity on any other phone in this category."</p><p><strong>✅Recommended if:</strong> You want the best hardware package available in the mid-range segment today. There isn't another phone that matches the OnePlus 13R in this regard. </p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You need clean software with fast updates. </p><p><strong>Alternative deal: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Gemini-Smartphone-Incredible/dp/B0DVJ11FP4"><strong>Google Pixel 9a — $449 on Amazon</strong></a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Smartphone-Snapdragon-SUPERVOOC-Hasselblad/dp/B0DP96J3KT/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="f6b9d3bc-7f36-428c-b39f-29bb0c276185" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Was: $599" data-dimension48="Was: $599" data-dimension25="$499">View Deal</a></p></div><p>The OnePlus 13R is a delight to use; it has a minimalist design that's good to hold and use, and even though it has a 6,000mAh battery, it isn't unwieldy in the least. The panel now has a 2K resolution (2780 x 1264) with 120Hz refresh, and it gets bright — I didn't have any issues using it outdoors under intense heat.</p><p>The Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset ensures the phone handles anything you throw at it; there wasn't any issue with overheating even while playing demanding games, and I didn't see any slowdowns in regular use. The cameras are just as good as the OnePlus 13, and while you miss out on some versatility, you get terrific photos and videos.</p><p>Thanks to the 6,000mAh battery, the phone lasts up to two days between charges. And it has 55W charging, with the battery taking less than an hour to charge — that's less time than the Galaxy S25 Ultra and Pixel 9 Pro XL.</p><p>OnePlus did a better job with the software as well, and while there's still overt customization, it looks modern, and you get plenty of useful features. Honestly, I wouldn't consider buying any other phone in this category, and if you're looking to upgrade, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Smartphone-Snapdragon-SUPERVOOC-Hasselblad/dp/B0DP96J3KT/">OnePlus 13R is my recommendation at $499</a>.</p><p><em><strong>For everything to do with Amazon Prime Day, head to our </strong></em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><em><strong>ultimate buying guide</strong></em></u></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></p> ]]></dc:content>

The bezels are relatively thin, it's easy to transfer photos to the device, and it has built-in storage.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You need smart assistant integration.</p><p>The Pexar is straightforward to set up and use; it uses the Frameo platform, and you can easily connect it to your phone to transfer photos. The free plan is limited to sending 15 photos at once, so I just plugged in a USB-C drive to the back of the unit and transferred thousands of photos in a matter of minutes.</p><p>The design is elegant, and the bezels around the panel aren't as thick as other photo frames. The 2K resolution (2000 x 1200) is adequate, and 32GB built-in storage means you can easily store thousands of photos; I transferred over 2,000 images to the frame, and it only took up over 3GB of storage. If you have a sizable media library, you can always slot in an SD card.</p><p>The software is minimal, and you get a decent set of options around managing slideshows of albums. You can also set a schedule so the frame automatically turns off at night, get weather notifications, and set up a clock. The touchscreen is fluid and there's no lag while using the interface, and the anti-glare panel makes a decent amount of difference.</p><p>If you need a digital photo frame or are looking to gift one, the Pexar is a great overall option, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Fluke-SAFAVIEH-Luxe-Collection-Runner/dp/B0C9H54GLX">$110 makes it a good Prime Day deal</a>.</p><p><em><strong>For everything on Amazon Prime Day, head to our </strong></em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><em><strong>ultimate buying guide</strong></em></u></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></p> ]]></dc:content>

It attaches magnetically to the back of a phone — so you'll need a magnetic case if you're using an Android phone — and there's even a USB-C port that lets you charge a second device at up to 20W.</p><p>The PicoGo magnetic power bank usually costs $35, but it is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Baseus-Portable-Card-Size-Magnetic-Lightweight/dp/B0DYJY2MKS">now down to just $24 for Prime Day</a>, which is a terrific price. This is one of the best magnetic power banks around, and if you need a portable option you can take anywhere, it's the one I'd suggest — it's now my go-to choice while out and about.

In that case, I'd suggest getting the 10,000mAh variant of the PicoGo, which has Qi 2.

And at 0.3 inches, you won't even notice it while it's attached to your phone. The design is a clear point of differentiation, and the build quality is fantastic — I used this power bank for the better part of two months now, and it has been rock-solid.</p><p>It has good charging efficiency as well, and I didn't have any issues charging a variety of Android phones as well as my iPhone 16 Pro Max with the power bank. The added USB-C port makes it convenient to charge a second device.</p><p>Basically, the PicoGo has everything you need if you're looking for a reliable power bank that you can take anywhere.

In fact, I'm using it right now as I write this.</p><p>It's not too large and is quite lightweight, making it easy to throw into a bag or hold by the included strap, which is a nice touch. I have the black colorway, but I really like the orange. But of course, it's really about the sound.</p><p>The ULT Field 1 is an impressive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-speakers">Bluetooth speaker</a> that produces very loud sound, making it perfect for outdoor gatherings, especially in the summer. I bring it to gatherings pretty often, and while it can't hold a candle to larger stereo speakers, this definitely gets the job done.</p><p>And if you really wanna party, that big ULT button on top seriously amps up the bass, which may be too much for solo listening but is perfect for lively gatherings where people just want to dance. The 12-hour battery life also ensures that you'll be dancing all night long, and the IP67 rating means you can enjoy it at the pool or in the shower.</p><p>Seriously, I love this thing, and I expect many others do, too, hence the 4.6-star rating on Amazon.</p><h2 id="prime-day-2025-android-deals-quick-links-2">Prime Day 2025 Android deals - quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals" target="_blank"><strong>Prime Day is coming: see the full list of Amazon deals</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phones: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals?ref_=nav_cs_gb&bubble-id=cell-phones-accessories" target="_blank">major discounts on Samsung and Pixel</a></li><li><strong>Tablets: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=tablets" target="_blank">discounted Galaxy Tab and iPad</a></li><li><strong>Wearables: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=smartwatches" target="_blank">up to %45 off Garmin watches</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime" target="_blank"><strong>Most Prime Day deals are members-only: sign up for the 30-day trial</strong></a></li></ul><p><em><strong>For everything on Amazon Prime Day, head to our </strong></em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><em><strong>ultimate shopping guide</strong></em></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></p> ]]></dc:content>

You don't have to worry about exposing it to the elements outdoors since it sports a robust IP67 water and dust-proof rating. There's a companion app with an equalizer to tweak the sound, but you probably won't need it much anyway because this speaker sounds phenomenal out of the box. It's a great portable audio solution in a luxurious body.</p><p>Although there's no Auracast support on the model, you can stack two or more of these speakers to create a stereo pair. And with a deal this cheap, you can easily grab two of these <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-speakers">excellent speakers</a> from Marshall. It'll double the fun and deliver synchronized audio that sounds sublime.</p><p>I was very pleased with the battery life on Emberton II while testing it. Once you're done with 30 hours of playback, you can quickly recharge it back thanks to fast charging via USB-C.

And you won't have to worry as much about dropping the phone, thanks to the use of soft vegan leather material on the back.</p><p>Software support isn't as robust as what you'd find on a Samsung or Pixel phone, but you still get two OS upgrades to Android 17 and three years of security updates (which can sometimes include new feature additions).</p><p>That said, many of these sentiments carry over to last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-stylus-5g-2024-review">Moto G Stylus 5G 2024</a>, which is also on sale for Prime Day.

I prefer a more <em>traditional</em> sound, but still want open-ear spatial awareness and a secure ear hook so I know I'll never get surprised by a cyclist behind me or drop an earbud while sprinting.</p><p>Enter the Shokz OpenFit 2! These earbuds deliver surprisingly rich sound — I never have to go above 50% volume outside of phone calls — offer IP55 water resistance so sweat won't damage them, and have an ergonomic hook that doesn't hurt my ears after hours of wearing them.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="1cd4efa2-456e-408e-8eb3-30a2eb870a1d" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="This is Shokz's first discount on these 2025 fitness earbuds since they launched, and it's already a huge one!

Shokz gave the OpenFit 2 stronger magnets to guarantee charging, tactile buttons for easier on-the-run controls, and a better design, and it seriously paid off.</p><p>My only complaints about the Shokz OpenFit 2? There's no Find My option if the case falls down a couch cushion, and Shokz doesn't warn you if your case is running out of juice, so the earbuds stay at low power. My advice is to buy the Beige OpenFits so that they're easier to find, and just remember to charge the case every once in a while!</p><p>Otherwise, the Shokz OpenFit 2 is my daily running companion, and I'd be thrilled to buy them for this price.

However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DPGBSKR2/">this Prime Day deal</a> slashes that price by $300, placing this impressive AI phone in mid-range Android territory.

At 5.8mm, it's currently Samsung's thinnest flagship phone, but the company had to make some compromises to get there.</p><p>For starters, the battery is 1,000mAh smaller than the unit in the Galaxy S25 Plus. Additionally, unlike the Galaxy S25 Plus, which features a triple camera system that includes a 3x telephoto lens, the Galaxy S25 Edge has only a two-camera system. Sure, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-camera-review">the 200MP primary camera is certainly impressive</a>, but nothing beats the versatility of a dedicated telephoto lens.</p><p>However, as far as thickness goes, during my time using the Galaxy S25 Plus, I never once thought to myself, "I wish this phone were thinner." At 7.3mm, the phone already looks sufficiently thin and, frankly, feels excellent in hand.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4099px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="mLqS6nAPQoY8AH8jLyXbMW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-review-01" alt="Holding the Galaxy S25 Plus outdoors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mLqS6nAPQoY8AH8jLyXbMW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4099" height="2306" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This is why I think the Galaxy S25 Plus is the better buy for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/primeday">Prime Day</a>.

I've been using the Motorola Razr Plus 2025 for several weeks now and while I love it, I don't think there's enough of a difference between it and last year's model to justify the price.</p><p>That's especially true on Prime Day when the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D2JBK6PG"><strong>is $300 less</strong></a> than the 2025 version. Even though you'll be saving $300, you'll still be getting the same great Qualcomm Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 processor inside as the 2025 model, the same excellent OLED displays with great eye care settings (including an option to disable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a> entirely), and the same amazing outer display you can run <em>any</em> app on.</p><p>In fact, the cameras are all the same 50MP spec, you get the same amount and speed of RAM and storage, the same size battery, and the same great Moto software. Truly, there's very little reason to pay extra, even without this Prime Day deal.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-2025-early-deals-and-faq" target="_blank"><strong>Prime Day deals and FAQ</strong></a></li><li><strong></strong><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-buy-black-friday-in-july-anti-prime-day-deals-2025"><strong>Anti-Prime deals from Best Buy</strong></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="d45e6af5-e8d0-4328-98d3-3da1ba0fa3ec" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Was: $799.99" data-dimension48="Was: $799.99" data-dimension25="$" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D2JBK6PG" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="znCGGT5zMeoWnypVRNhjQW" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-render-spring-green-4.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/znCGGT5zMeoWnypVRNhjQW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Motorola Razr Plus 2024 📨</strong></p><p><strong>Was: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D2JBK6PG" target="_blank" data-dimension112="d45e6af5-e8d0-4328-98d3-3da1ba0fa3ec" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Was: $799.99" data-dimension48="Was: $799.99" data-dimension25="$"><del>$799.99</del></a></p><p><strong>Starting at:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D2JBK6PG" target="_blank"><strong>$699.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p><em>"The Motorola Razr Plus 2024 is an impressive phone that continues to set the standard for other flip phones. The 4-inch cover screen is more useful than ever, and Motorola has clearly put more thought into the software around it. Cameras and battery life are also much improved, but there are some blips when it comes to the overall software experience, and some may not like the switch from ultrawide to telephoto. But overall, the Razr Plus 2024 is a great phone that you should consider as your next." — Derrek Lee for Android Central</em></p><p><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review"><strong>Android Central review</strong> ⭐⭐⭐⭐1/2</a></p><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you've been sitting on the fence waiting to see if a foldable phone gets cheap enough to make the jump. There's some kind of special joy that comes with folding a phone in half, and the Motorola Razr is the best of the best.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you're looking for the fastest processor or the best cameras.

If you're a beach bum or just tend to drop your phone in dirt, it might be worth it to spend the extra $300 or grab one of the many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/the-best-motorola-razr-razr-plus-razr-ultra-2025-deals">Motorola Razr Plus 2025 deals</a> from your favorite carrier.</p><p>The Razr Plus 2025 gets one additional year of promised Android updates, stopping at Android 18, with security updates through the end of 2029. The 2024 model stops at Android 17 with security patches through the end of 2028. That's all great if you're planning to hold on to the phone for more than the next four years.</p><p>Other than that, there's not much to speak of. Pantone color validation for the Razr Plus 2025's cameras is quite nice, but it's not worth the extra cash, according to my testing. I'd say just save the $300 now by buying the Razr Plus 2024 and upgrade a few years down the road when Motorola gives the series a huge spec bump.</p><ul><li>For more on Prime Day 2025, check out <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><strong>our ultimate shopping guide</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The latest version launched last year, but this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide">Prime Day</a> is the first time I've seen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D9WW49PJ/">a significant discount</a> for it on Amazon.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-review">Oura Ring 4</a> normally retails for $349, which is $50 more than the starting price of the Oura Ring Gen 3. However, this 15% discount shoves the price down to just $296.65, which is slightly lower than last-gen's starting price of $299. You can also opt for the pricier color options, such as Brushed Silver (my personal favorite), which is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D9WVHS7S/">$60 off for Prime Day</a>!</p><p>The best part about this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/primeday">Prime Day deal</a>? You can use your FSA or HSA to purchase the device, meaning you can put that money to good use if it would otherwise go unused.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="a2b273af-55bb-4e5a-8c0b-817edbc526b8" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Oura Ring 4" data-dimension48="The Oura Ring 4 is a stylish wearable with a ton of tech stuffed in it.

I was impressed by just how much technology was packed into this small ring, and Oura continued to improve it by adding more features.</p><p>The same has been true for the Oura Ring 4, which arrived with a better sensor layout, an enhanced algorithm, and even better battery life. The ring is capable of automatically tracking heart rate data when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/can-oura-ring-4-automatically-detect-workouts">automatically detecting activities</a>, and Oura has worked to make step counts and other data more accurate than ever.</p><p>I've also found the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring/oura-rolls-out-its-ai-powered-personal-trainer">Oura AI advisor</a> very helpful, as it uses my data to inform me on how I can improve my sleep or readiness. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring/oura-can-now-track-meals-and-glucose-parameters-for-us-users">meal tracker</a> also utilizes AI to log your food; simply point a camera at it, and it will automatically identify what you ate and how your meal timing regularly contributes to your overall health. It's all very intuitive, and given Oura's tendency to add more features, I feel it makes the $6/month subscription all the more worth it.</p><p>Of course, you can also opt for last year's Oura Ring Gen 3, which remains a great device and offers many features found in the Oura Ring 4.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="f7c2ae1d-8d28-42b7-86f8-f4dbc6a36dcb" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="The Oura Ring Gen 3 launched in 2021 for $299, but with the new and improved Oura Ring 4 available, you can now purchase this model for just $249, which is $50 cheaper than its original launch price." data-dimension48="The Oura Ring Gen 3 launched in 2021 for $299, but with the new and improved Oura Ring 4 available, you can now purchase this model for just $249, which is $50 cheaper than its original launch price." data-dimension25="$249" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CSRC9JP5/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="pxSbe7Q7pa4NpBK8BN8ryg" name="oura-ring-heritage-gen-3-render.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pxSbe7Q7pa4NpBK8BN8ryg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>The Oura Ring Gen 3 launched in 2021 for $299, but with the new and improved Oura Ring 4 available, you can now purchase this model for just $249, which is $50 cheaper than its original launch price.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CSRC9JP5/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="f7c2ae1d-8d28-42b7-86f8-f4dbc6a36dcb" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="The Oura Ring Gen 3 launched in 2021 for $299, but with the new and improved Oura Ring 4 available, you can now purchase this model for just $249, which is $50 cheaper than its original launch price." data-dimension48="The Oura Ring Gen 3 launched in 2021 for $299, but with the new and improved Oura Ring 4 available, you can now purchase this model for just $249, which is $50 cheaper than its original launch price." data-dimension25="$249">View Deal</a></p></div><h2 id="prime-day-2025-android-deals-quick-links-37">Prime Day 2025 Android deals - quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals" target="_blank"><strong>Prime Day is coming: see the full list of Amazon deals</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phones: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals?ref_=nav_cs_gb&bubble-id=cell-phones-accessories" target="_blank">major discounts on Samsung and Pixel</a></li><li><strong>Tablets: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=tablets" target="_blank">discounted Galaxy Tab and iPad</a></li><li><strong>Wearables: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=smartwatches" target="_blank">up to %45 off Garmin watches</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime" target="_blank"><strong>Most Prime Day deals are members-only: sign up for the 30-day trial</strong></a></li></ul><p><em><strong>For everything on Amazon Prime Day, head to our </strong></em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><em><strong>ultimate shopping guide</strong></em></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></p> ]]></dc:content>

Why? Because the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Wellness-Manufacturer/dp/B0D1YNVD88"><strong>Galaxy Watch 7 is $159 (47% off) on Amazon</strong></a>, and it's hard to imagine the Watch 8's upgrades will be enough to justify spending twice as much!</p><p>The Galaxy Watch 8 is rumored to get a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/galaxy-watch-8-and-8-classic-might-get-significant-price-bump">price increase</a>, as well as (according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/smartwatches/another-major-samsung-galaxy-watch-8-leak-may-have-revealed-full-specs-and-prices">Techradar</a>) the same Exynos W1000 chip, 2GB of RAM, and 32GB of storage as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a>.

We'll find out for certain tomorrow, and none of this is certain. But given how quickly Prime Day deals can sell out, it makes sense to snag the Watch 7 <em>now</em> at this ridiculously low price, and then return it if the Watch 8 defies expectations and blows you away.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="5a2e468b-6604-4eac-b59d-959c4759efc0" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="also Galaxy Watch 7 44mm: was $329" data-dimension48="also Galaxy Watch 7 44mm: was $329" data-dimension25="$159.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Wellness-Manufacturer/dp/B0D1YNVD88" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="iEibk5Cnay9wE9TRFYsvS6" name="Samsung Galaxy Watch 7" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iEibk5Cnay9wE9TRFYsvS6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>also Galaxy Watch 7 44mm: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Wellness-Manufacturer/dp/B0D1YQ3MML" data-dimension112="5a2e468b-6604-4eac-b59d-959c4759efc0" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="also Galaxy Watch 7 44mm: was $329" data-dimension48="also Galaxy Watch 7 44mm: was $329" data-dimension25="$159.99"><del>was $329</del> <strong>now $199.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>We've had the Galaxy Watch 7 ranked as the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android smartwatch</a> for the past 12 months, beating out Google Pixel, Garmin, OnePlus, and other brands for its combination of fast performance, solid battery life, and four years of software support.

Users interested in trying out the feature will be able to put their destination on Google Maps on their connected <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android smartphone</a>, and the app will then send notifications to their Garmin smartwatch — further giving directions on when to take turns while they are walking, running, or cycling, for example.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="qgPSTktNHARzCuttwE4jUd" name="Google-maps-Garmin-integration-01" alt="Google Maps on Garmin" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qgPSTktNHARzCuttwE4jUd.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="sczd6NhaVNbuyp8voGNbVd" name="Google-maps-Garmin-integration-03" alt="Google Maps on Garmin" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sczd6NhaVNbuyp8voGNbVd.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="9v27qp3BnjLfSRL2xhvjUd" name="Google-maps-Garmin-integration-02" alt="Google Maps on Garmin" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9v27qp3BnjLfSRL2xhvjUd.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>“Whether exploring a new city, mapping out a run, or casually cycling with friends, the Google Maps app in the Connect IQ store will keep users going in the right direction.

Before you start, I recommend ensuring that you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/how-adjust-eye-distance-ipd-meta-quest-3s">set the lens spacing properly</a> to provide the best comfort; otherwise, you could get tired eyes after a short while.</p><p>All Meta Quest 3S consoles come with 3 months of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-plus-subscription">Meta Horizon Plus</a> gaming subscription for free.

The S25 Ultra is also powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite processor (widely considered to be one of the best chipsets in use today), plus you get a ton of Galaxy AI-boosted software features and 12GB of RAM.

Amazfit best fits the bill for combining quality with low prices, and as the site's Wearables editor with years of experience wearing them, I can point you to the two best deals: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazfit-Balance-Fitness-Composition-Bluetooth/dp/B0C7GGYS7M"><strong>Amazfit Balance for $129 (35% off)</strong></a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazfit-Premium-Fitness-Resistant-Sapphire/dp/B0DT3YMDMZ"><strong>Amazfit Active 2 (up to 23% off)</strong></a>.</p><p>Although my colleague absolutely <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit/amazfit-balance-2-impression" target="_blank">loves the Amazfit Balance 2</a>, which still costs $299, putting it in the same realm as true smartwatches.

And in that case, I'll point you to the Amazfit Active 2: It's a lighter option with a 1.3-inch, 2,000-nit display, more stylish steel bezel, and a next-gen PPG for more accurate HR data, while still costing less! You do lose days of battery life and the rotating crown, but it's a fair trade for the lower price.</p><p>The best price is the standard Active 2 for $84.99 (15% off), but if you upgrade to the Active 2 Premium ($99, 23% off), you get sapphire glass, contactless payments in Europe, and a second leather strap with the normal silicone one. I'd say it's worth the $15 surcharge for the better display protection alone!</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="e8978f85-ee18-4839-bba6-f7f1d7ec3a3e" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="or Amazfit Active 2: was $99" data-dimension48="or Amazfit Active 2: was $99" data-dimension25="$99.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazfit-Premium-Fitness-Resistant-Sapphire/dp/B0DT3YMDMZ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3RzqijGRsszVNmDSqg68Fo" name="amazfit-active-2-renders" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3RzqijGRsszVNmDSqg68Fo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>or Amazfit Active 2: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazfit-Fitness-Tracker-Resistant-Silicone/dp/B0DT3YNMBX" data-dimension112="e8978f85-ee18-4839-bba6-f7f1d7ec3a3e" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="or Amazfit Active 2: was $99" data-dimension48="or Amazfit Active 2: was $99" data-dimension25="$99.99"><del>was $99</del> <strong>now $80.74 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>The Amazfit Active 2 has incredible value in a $99 smartwatch, and this Prime Deal essentially lets you get the Premium upgrade — a leather strap, NFC, and sapphire glass — for the normal price.

The A9 Plus includes a larger, 11-inch LCD display than the base model, and Samsung upgraded this generation with an improved Snapdragon 695 CPU. While it's nothing too special, this is about as good as tablets get around this discounted price point.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/prime-day-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon Prime Day deals on other Samsung Galaxy devices</strong></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$219.99" data-dimension48="$219.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CLF3VPMV" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="rUNyvTLboDppMEkJGRiNGo" name="Samsung-Galaxy-A9-Plus-screen.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rUNyvTLboDppMEkJGRiNGo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy Tab A9 Plus:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CLF3VPMV" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$219.99" data-dimension48="$219.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$219.99</del> <strong>$132.99 for Amazon Prime Day</strong></a></p><p>Prime Day has officially arrived with a ton of <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/prime-day-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025">Samsung Galaxy deals</a> in tow, such as this offer that cuts 40% off the Galaxy Tab A9 Plus.

As an Android tablet, it's pretty much the perfect tablet for almost everything. But it really flexes its muscles when attached to the included Charging Speaker Dock, transforming it into a supercharged smart home display." — Andrew Myrick for Android Central</p><p><strong>Android Central review</strong> ⭐⭐⭐⭐1/2</p><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you're a casual tablet user who loves seeing their photos displayed in an elegant way, want a great smart home control center, and enjoys using the power of Gemini all without having to look for their phone. Pair it with the dock to turn it into an excellent speaker system, too!</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you're a power user who spends lots of time on your tablet or absolutely needs top-tier performance.

Like I said before, at least the price savings on the Pixel Tablet makes up for having to buy the dock separately, and you still end up saving $30 in the end.</p><p>When it's not docked, you'll notice that this is a tablet made for human hands. It's got reasonably sized bezels that give your thumbs a place to hold it and a soft touch back that's grippy, even with wet hands. Too many tablets try to make the bezels tiny and give it a shiny plastic or glass back, which is just plain stupid in my opinion.</p><p>Not only that, but the Pixel Tablet's display is superb in every way. It's nice and bright, has excellent colors and contrast, and doesn't use nasty <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a> like Google's Pixel phones do. In other words, it's everything I'd love to see from a Pixel! Plus, all the little Pixel touches and regular updates always make it fun to pick up on a random whim.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="R7xtfuLqcktmvkDwWpiE3U" name="google-pixel-tablet-smart-home-controls" alt="The Google Pixel Tablet with a smart home controls widget on the home screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/R7xtfuLqcktmvkDwWpiE3U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>My three favorite features are some the same things I loved from my Nest Hub — that's the Google Photos screensaver and easy smart home controls — plus the ability to use Gemini instead of Google Assistant. I've unplugged all but one of my Nest speakers at this point because Assistant has become so darn unreliable, but Gemini has been a champ and the perfect replacement for Google Assistant in my home.</p><p>Aside from Gemini just plain working better for smart home controls and other queries, it's also smarter and can understand complex commands. That's particularly nice when I want to turn off specific lights and adjust the thermostat at the same time instead of having to issue separate commands one at a time.</p><p>And did I mention how good the audio is from the dock? It would make my Nest Hub blush if the thing still worked (which it doesn't). This dock's speaker doesn't feel like some convenience compromise; it feels like a proper audio system that works to fill the room with quality audio and actual booming bass. Overall. I couldn't ask for a better Nest Hub replacement, especially since you can <em>remove</em> it from the dock and turn it into a normal Android tablet.</p><ul><li>For more on Prime Day 2025, check out <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><strong>our ultimate shopping guide</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The Beats Pill, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sonos-roam-2-review">Sonos Roam 2</a>, and Bose's own SoundLink Flex all cost around $150, for example, and that's before any potential sales, such as this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/amazon-prime-day">Prime Day</a> discount on the Beats Pill.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="7ec995e2-5f05-4050-9421-48717bd3471d" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$149.95" data-dimension48="$149.95" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="FKcGqLcoofbCvHHAqLFtzP" name="beats-pill-square-Champagne.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FKcGqLcoofbCvHHAqLFtzP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Beats Pill:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D4SX9RC6/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored" data-dimension112="7ec995e2-5f05-4050-9421-48717bd3471d" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$149.95" data-dimension48="$149.95" data-dimension25=""><del>$149.95</del> <strong>$99.95 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>While the Bose SoundLink Plus is great, the Beats Pill is hard to ignore at this Amazon Prime Day deal price.

I've spent months using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/beats-pill-2024-review">Beats Pill</a> and recently switched to the SoundLink Plus. While I had my doubts at first, I've come to realize the SoundLink Plus absolutely brings more to the table than the Beats Pill.</p><p>You'll just have to decide whether bass and volume boosts are worth about $120 more than the Pill. With the speaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D4SX9RC6/">on sale for Amazon Prime Day</a>, it's even tougher to ignore how attractive the Beats Pill looks.</p><h2 id="bose-s-soundlink-plus-packs-a-major-punch-in-sound-quality-2">Bose's SoundLink Plus packs a major punch in sound quality</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CrWTBrj4NDNSPc5shRfq9a" name="Bose-SoundLink-Plus-vs-Beats-Pill-9" alt="The Bose SoundLink Plus (black) beside the Beats Pill (red) on a slab of concrete." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CrWTBrj4NDNSPc5shRfq9a.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Bose specifically notes that the SoundLink Plus is designed to bring the bass, and it doesn't disappoint. In fact, some of the people that I played the speaker for found the bass <em>too</em> intense. But let's face it, this is a beach and party speaker, so that's probably what you're going for. The further you stand away from the speaker, the less in-your-face the bass feels.</p><p>It's not just the speaker's tuning, however. Compared to the Beats Pill, the SoundLink Plus has a more full sound across the entire soundstage. While you might notice it most when listening to pop, hip hop, or R&B, you can also hear the difference across genres like alternative, jazz, and indie.</p><p>Listening to the SoundLink Plus sounds like I'm bringing my desktop speakers with me in a more compact form, whereas the Pill is more like an upgrade over my smartphone speakers. They both get the job done, especially while out and about, but the Bose SoundLink Plus makes the most of its bigger size.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="cBaMQgN2mFtPoKHc35b8XZ" name="Bose-SoundLink-Plus-vs-Beats-Pill-10" alt="The back side and USB-C ports on the Bose SoundLink Plus (black) and the Beats Pill (red)." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cBaMQgN2mFtPoKHc35b8XZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The SoundLink Plus sounds better than the Pill at all volumes, but it was shocking just how much louder Bose's speaker can get than the Beats option. I tested both speakers listening to the same tracks at 50% volume back-to-back, and the Pill was incredibly quiet. I'd probably need to crank the Pill up to 80-100% volume to fill a room, and the SoundLink Plus sounded like more than enough with the volume at 50%.</p><h2 id="portability-is-up-for-grabs-2">Portability is up for grabs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xPHG2Ap9p6WJ92LBXm6qxZ" name="Bose-SoundLink-Plus-vs-Beats-Pill-7" alt="The speaker grills of the Bose SoundLink Plus (black) beside the Beats Pill (red)." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xPHG2Ap9p6WJ92LBXm6qxZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's tough to say which speaker is better for portability. The natural choice would be the Beats Pill, as it weighs about 1.5 pounds. The Bose SoundLink Plus is more than twice as heavy at 3.4 pounds, though it doesn't feel as bad in the hand. In terms of design, the Pill slightly tilts the audio drivers upward — toward your ears for a better listening experience — whereas the SoundLink Plus is shaped more like a rectangle.</p><p>The reason I like the SoundLink for portability has to do with its lanyard loop. It has a built-in "utility rope loop" that's shorter than the one on the Beats Pill but is much more durable. In this case, I think Bose's shorter and thicker loop is more useful than Beats' thinner and longer one.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="byyppLJk6iUohTPWmJfQ8a" name="Bose-SoundLink-Plus-vs-Beats-Pill-6" alt="The Bose SoundLink Plus (black) and its utility rope beside the Beats Pill (red) and its lanyard loop." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/byyppLJk6iUohTPWmJfQ8a.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I grew up near a beach town, and I could totally see people using a carabiner to clip the SoundLink Plus to a bike, beach chair, or backpack. It's rugged enough to handle that, and the shorter loop means the speaker won't swing as much as the Beats Pill would if used in a similar load-out. On the other hand, the Pill is small enough to slot into a water bottle holder, so both have advantages depending on your everyday carry.</p><p>Luckily, you get IP67 certification with both speakers, so you'll have sand and splash protection for your days at the beach.</p><h2 id="bose-has-the-better-app-and-buttons-2">Bose has the better app and buttons</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xoRUQdoDHxtVstFJYkENzY" name="Bose-SoundLink-Plus-vs-Beats-Pill-5" alt="The controls on the Bose SoundLink Plus." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xoRUQdoDHxtVstFJYkENzY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The SoundLink Plus addresses one of the Beats Pill's biggest flaws — the Pill has an awful set of hardware buttons. There are two many purposes tied to the same button — the power button is used to turn the device on and off, check battery life, and initiate pairing mode. It's too much to keep track of, and it's frankly a frustrating experience.</p><p>Switching to the SoundLink Plus was like a breath of fresh air in this regard. There are six hardware buttons that handle all the functions you'd regularly need, making for little confusion. This simplicity alone made the Bose speaker feel more premium and handy than the Beats one.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5gKQYt8K2uvAL8jakxm28Z" name="Bose-SoundLink-Plus-vs-Beats-Pill-4" alt="The controls on the Beats Pill (red) with the SoundLink Plus partly in the frame." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5gKQYt8K2uvAL8jakxm28Z.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Neither speaker has an outstanding companion app, but the Bose app at least adds an EQ function and lets you manage multi-source pairing.

They're all <em>just fine</em> — great for on-the-go use, but I'd never go out of my way to listen to them. It made me wonder, would a more expensive speaker like the Bose SoundLink Plus actually add enough value to be worth $120 more than those starter options?</p><p>After testing the SoundLink Plus for a few weeks, I came away massively impressed. To me, paying around $270 for a portable speaker is still probably a bit too much. As a budding audiophile, I'd rather invest in my main audio setup before branching out into premium portable options.</p><p>However, it's clear to me that the SoundLink Plus really is $120 better than speakers like the Beats Pill. It sounds sharper, fuller, and louder while having a better build and controls. If you have the money to spend or simply want to invest in a speaker for portable and at-home use, the Bose SoundLink Plus is a great option.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="e9809c51-2938-4ae1-ae74-0082b77f6ffa">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SgsXKgfXSYuoAw3cWa5wMZ.jpg' alt="The Bose SoundLink Plus in black in a white product render."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Bose SoundLink Plus</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>A premium speaker</strong></em></p><p>With booming bass and a 20-hour battery life, the Bose SoundLink Plus is a big upgrade for people who need a portable speaker.

That makes it great for working or gaming on the go, or just to avoid the neck pain that comes with looking down at a handheld gaming console like the Steam Deck for long periods of time.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-2025-early-deals-and-faq" target="_blank"><strong>Prime Day deals and FAQ</strong></a></li><li><strong></strong><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-buy-black-friday-in-july-anti-prime-day-deals-2025"><strong>Anti-Prime deals from Best Buy</strong></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="1a269895-0df0-41eb-829b-7eda4a6286ce" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Was: $499.99" data-dimension48="Was: $499.99" data-dimension25="$" href="https://www.amazon.com/VITURE-Pro-Glasses-UltraClarity-Electrochromic/dp/B0DDNW8F5W/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1152px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="2x4swqbMndsQa27S2EX3ZJ" name="viture-pro-ecosystem-official-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2x4swqbMndsQa27S2EX3ZJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1152" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Viture Pro smart glasses 😎</strong></p><p><strong>Was: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/VITURE-Pro-Glasses-UltraClarity-Electrochromic/dp/B0DDNW8F5W/" target="_blank" data-dimension112="1a269895-0df0-41eb-829b-7eda4a6286ce" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Was: $499.99" data-dimension48="Was: $499.99" data-dimension25="$"><del>$499.99</del></a></p><p><strong>Now:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/VITURE-Pro-Glasses-UltraClarity-Electrochromic/dp/B0DDNW8F5W/" target="_blank"><strong>$349.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>"When I think about all the amazing products Viture makes, I get really excited. As a gadget geek, there's something special about a company that makes a whole ecosystem of products that work with each other, and Viture is the king of XR glasses ecosystems." — Nick Sutrich</p><p><strong>Android Central review</strong> ⭐⭐⭐⭐/5</p><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you take a lot of business trips working on laptops, play a ton of games on handheld devices, or just want more comfortable, personal entertainment wherever you are. Viture's ecosystem of compatible products is second to none, and Viture Pro smart glasses work with them all.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you want a pair of smart glasses that can do 3DoF tracking like a VR headset, keeping the display in place while you look around freely. For that, you'll want to pick up Xreal One smart glasses, which are <a href="https://www.amazon.com/XREAL-Glasses-Display-Expertly-Android/dp/B0F7R96TFC/"><strong>on sale for $449</strong></a> during Prime Day.</p><p><strong>Price check 💵: </strong><a href="https://www.viture.com/product/viture-pro-xr-glasses?color=Jet+Black">$409 at Viture</a></p><p><strong>Alternative deal 🪙: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/XREAL-Glasses-Display-Expertly-Android/dp/B0F7R96TFC/"><strong>Xreal One </strong><del>$499</del><strong> $449 at Amazon</strong></a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/VITURE-Pro-Glasses-UltraClarity-Electrochromic/dp/B0DDNW8F5W/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="1a269895-0df0-41eb-829b-7eda4a6286ce" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Was: $499.99" data-dimension48="Was: $499.99" data-dimension25="$">View Deal</a></p></div><p>The single best reason to choose any pair of Viture smart glasses is the company's ecosystem of products. For me, that starts with the Viture Pro Mobile Dock <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/i-found-smart-glasses-that-work-perfectly-on-the-nintendo-switch-2-and-all-your-favorite-systems">which I tested</a> to work with the Nintendo Switch 2.</p><p>You can't plug <em>any</em> pair of smart glasses directly into the Switch 2 because Nintendo locked down the USB-C port, but the Viture Pro Mobile Dock can decode Nintendo's nonsense and let you play on a giant OLED on the go. Thankfully, the Viture Pro Mobile Dock is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/VITURE-Compatible-PlayStation-Supports-Handheld/dp/B0D3LT6BJW/"><strong>on sale for $109</strong></a> during Prime Day this year!</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/viture-8bitdo-ultimate-mobile-controller">Viture x 8BitDo Ultimate Controller</a> does something similar for your favorite smartphone games, and it works perfectly with streaming services like GeForce Now and Xbox GamePass. I played hours of Monster Hunter Wilds with this controller and Viture smart glasses, all without breaking my neck by looking down at a a handheld gaming PC. That one's on sale for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/VITURE-8BitDo-Ultimate-Mobile-Gaming-Controller/dp/B0F5WRZ3LJ/"><strong>10% off</strong></a> during Prime day.</p><h2 id="why-choose-viture-luma-over-viture-pro-2">Why choose Viture Luma over Viture Pro?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LpjbcN8KXcTJZpyhbH9j3Y" name="viture-luma-pro-with-box-and-case-02" alt="A pair of Viture Luma Pro smart glasses inside their blue felt-lined case, next to its box and a Viturist sticker" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LpjbcN8KXcTJZpyhbH9j3Y.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Sure, it's hard to pass up a $150 off deal, but some people just want the latest and best. That's what Viture Luma Pro is. They sport the latest Sony micro-OLED displays with 1200p resolution. That's an upgrade over the 1080p resolution of Viture Pro. Viture Luma Pro also sports a 52-degree FoV, making the display wider and more viewable than Viture Pro's 46-degree FoV.</p><p>Viture also upgraded the comfort options on Viture Luma Pro, with a new magnetic nose piece rest that's easier to swap out, plus arms that adjust to three different settings to better fit your face. That ensures you won't have any problem finding the clear sweet spot, and DC dimming for the OLED display ensures that even most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM sensitive</a> users feel comfortable using these.</p><p>Aside from that, Luma Pro has a built-in camera up front that can be covered if it bothers the people around you. While the camera doesn't do much right now, Viture is planning to add 3DoF tracking in a future update, making them feel similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-one-pro-and-xreal-eye-deliver-a-new-vision-for-smart-glasses">Xreal One Pro</a> smart glasses at $200 less than Xreal charges. Of course, you'll have to wait an undisclosed time for that feature to make its debut, so while it might be a better value down the road, these glasses don't do what Xreal does out of the box <em>today</em>.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="eAUTgvEXWWuNfPFXx3Sfxk" name="viture-luma-pro-vs-viture-pro-front" alt="Comparing Viture Luma Pro (left) with Viture Pro (right)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eAUTgvEXWWuNfPFXx3Sfxk.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rzbcBsFMrSXesVsZeFDR2m" name="viture-luma-pro-vs-viture-pro-lenses" alt="Comparing Viture Luma Pro (left) with Viture Pro (right)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rzbcBsFMrSXesVsZeFDR2m.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="d2J7tqWGeRVn5kp2dE26zk" name="viture-luma-pro-vs-viture-pro-top" alt="Comparing Viture Luma Pro (left) with Viture Pro (right)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/d2J7tqWGeRVn5kp2dE26zk.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="D9YauHyERPYb8m8ZXBTrxk" name="viture-luma-pro-vs-viture-pro-magnetic-connector" alt="Comparing Viture Luma Pro (left) with Viture Pro (right)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/D9YauHyERPYb8m8ZXBTrxk.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="MmEHoq6QPiCrPWJjavCsxk" name="viture-luma-pro-vs-viture-pro-side" alt="Comparing Viture Luma Pro (left) with Viture Pro (right)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MmEHoq6QPiCrPWJjavCsxk.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>But let's be real, until that camera update comes out, there's not much of an upgrade here for most people to care about. Viture Luma Pro uses the same birdbath-style lenses as Viture Pro, the same excellent magnetic connector, and the same compatibility with the full Viture ecosystem.</p><p>If you end up loving Viture's fit, you can always grab a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/VITURE-Multi-screen-Assistant-12GB-256GB/dp/B0DRVPMT4T/">Viture Pro Neckband</a> — <strong>on sale for $173 off</strong> — to get a full computational experience on the go without having to hook your glasses up to a smartphone or other device. That lets you easily watch movies on a plane without wires hanging everywhere, and it even lets you play many Android games natively for a few hours.</p><p>Better yet, the Neckband supports PSPlay, so you can game on your PS5 wirelessly without hogging the TV. That's a lot better than the PlayStation Portal, if you ask me! If I'm choosing a pair of Viture glasses today, I'm grabbing the Viture Pro for $150 off and using that savings to grab one of Viture's other excellent add-ons to get a fuller experience for less money.</p><ul><li>For more on Prime Day 2025, check out <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><strong>our ultimate shopping guide</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The cable, albeit very tiny in length, is compatible with the 45W fast charging speed and it seamlessly acts as a lanyard or keyring of sorts when attached to the Pocket Rocket P50.</p><p>It comes with two USB-C and one USB-A port. It also recharges at 45W, keeping the P50 topped up is pretty effortless.</p><p>Since this is an airport-safe power bank, you can easily travel with it in your purse no matter where you're going.

The brand rolled out several updates over the course of 2025, bringing exciting utilities to its NAS systems. The result is that the brand's NAS portfolio is among the strongest around.</p><p>The 4-bay DXP4800 Plus in particular is a standout offering; this NAS server is powered by Intel's Pentium Gold 8505 platform, has 8GB of RAM, a 128GB integrated SSD, two M.2 slots, 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet along with 10 Gigabit Ethernet connectivity.</p><p>Basically, it is the most powerful NAS server in its category, and right now, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-DXP4800-Plus-Attached-Diskless/dp/B0D22JRHZB">buy it on Amazon for $519</a>, a $180 discount from its usual selling price.

With powerful internals and 10 Gigabit connectivity, the DXP4800 Plus isn't going to be obsolete anytime soon. You also get rock-solid build quality, good software with the ability to switch to TrueNAS, and two M.2 SSD slots.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You want the best software pre-installed. While it has plenty of flexibility, the software isn't quite the best around. If you don't want to install TrueNAS and just need something that has better feature-set out of the box, you'll need to get the DiskStation DS923+.</p><p>The DXP4800 Plus has sturdy build quality thanks to an all-metal chassis, and it doesn't take up that much room. You get four drive bays at the front that accommodate up to 28TB drives each, and there are dual M.2 slots. It has 8GB of RAM installed out of the box, and you even get a 128GB SSD that houses the software.</p><p>The UGOS Pro software is at a point where you get the basics with relative ease; you can install Plex media server, back up data, and stream content without any issues. As it has a powerful Intel platform, you get hardware-accelerated transcoding in Plex — if you're on the paid Plex Pass — and with Docker container management, you get to install just about any service you want. And if you don't like the look of the software, you can switch to TrueNAS Scale.</p><p>The 2.5 Gigabit port in addition to the 10 Gigabit connectivity is frankly overkill, and I didn't see any problems with the NAS in the six months I used it. This is the most powerful NAS server in the sub-$800 segment, and the fact that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-DXP4800-Plus-Attached-Diskless/dp/B0D22JRHZB">you can buy it for just $519</a> is amazing; you're getting a terrific value.</p><p><em><strong>For everything to do with Amazon Prime Day, head to our </strong></em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><em><strong>ultimate buying guide</strong></em></u></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></p> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review">Phone 3a</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/cmf-phone-2-pro-review">CMF Phone 2 Pro</a>, Nothing proved that it knows how to make terrific budget phones. The brand's unique design philosophy combined with its focus on delivering a great value allowed it to carve out a niche in markets like India, and that's no small feat.</p><p>Nothing is now aiming to emulate the same with the Phone 3, a flagship that's designed to go toe-to-toe with the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>, Xiaomi 15, and the Pixel 9. At the outset, there's plenty to like with the phone; it retains Nothing's design ethos, and you get a new Glyph Matrix pattern at the back with better usability.</p><p>The software is among the best of any phone you'll find in 2025, with Nothing delivering a clean interface that's vibrant and playful — just like the hardware design — along with useful additions like Essential Space.</p><p>But the biggest downside has to do with the hardware; the Phone 3 misses out on Qualcomm's flagship Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, and is instead powered by the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4, a mid-range platform seen on devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi/poco-f7-review">POCO F7</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/iqoo-neo-10-review">iQOO Neo 10</a>. It isn't just the chipset either; you don't get many of the features available on Chinese rivals, like IP69 water resistance.</p><p>Combine all of that with the $799 asking price, and the Phone 3 isn't anywhere as good a value as its budget-focused siblings. Don't get me wrong, it is still a great overall phone, but it just isn't worth the price — not when there are better alternatives available.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-nothing-phone-3-specs-pricing-and-availability"><span>Nothing Phone 3: Specs, pricing, and availability</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="TQiFSdmEJBhA67hNDMF5PR" name="Nothing Phone 3" alt="Nothing Phone 3 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TQiFSdmEJBhA67hNDMF5PR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Nothing unveiled the Phone 3 at a launch event in London on July 1, and the phone is now up for pre-order, with availability starting July 15.

There's a button at the back that lets you interact with the Glyph Matrix, essentially allowing you to cycle between the options available. It is well-thought-out, and definitely adds to the quirkiness of the device without being gimmicky.

It has 65W charging and takes just under an hour to charge the battery, but it goes to 50% in just over 22 minutes.</p><p>There's no charger included in the package, but as the device uses the standard USB PD 3.0 power profiles, you can use any PD GaN charger — I used the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/power-charging/ugreen-nexode-500w-gan-charging-station-ultimate-upgrade">Nexode 500W charging station</a>.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-nothing-phone-3-cameras"><span>Nothing Phone 3: Cameras</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="DerBGvKbF28Q7Tcbv23E9R" name="Nothing Phone 3" alt="Nothing Phone 3 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DerBGvKbF28Q7Tcbv23E9R.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>The phone has a trio of 50MP cameras at the back and a 50MP lens at the front. </strong></li><li><strong>It has the best cameras of any Nothing phone, and takes good photos/videos. </strong></li><li><strong>However, it doesn't hold its own against Chinese rivals. </strong></li></ul><p>Nothing has a quartet of 50MP cameras on the back of the Phone 3. The device gets a 50MP f/1.7 OmniVision OV50H module with a 1/1.3-inch sensor and OIS, and it's joined by a 50MP f/2.7 Samsung ISOCELL JN5 sensor with 3x optical zoom and OIS. There's also a 50MP f/2.2 Samsung ISOCELL JN1 wide-angle lens, and Nothing outfitted the same 50MP JN1 module as the selfie lens.</p><p>The camera interface is minimal, you get the standard shooting modes in a grid at the bottom, and toggles to switch between the lenses. You don't get much in the way of filters or additional shooting modes, but the basics are covered. The phone gets 4K60 HDR video with all four sensors, and that's good to see.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row

Resultant shots have good color balance and detail, and they're not overly saturated. Foliage is rendered well, and there isn't any aggressive smoothing. The phone does really well in low-light scenarios as well, producing vivid images with little to no visible noise.</p><p>The tele lens is good in its own right, delivering usable shots at up to 6x. It doesn't quite have the same tonal balance as the main camera, but it is a decent showing nevertheless. The main camera does well with portrait shots as well, but you don't get the same level of bokeh as other phones.</p><p>While the Phone 3 has the best camera package of any Nothing phone, it doesn't measure up to its Chinese rivals. The Vivo X200, X200 Pro, Xiaomi 15, Find X8, Find X8 Pro, and OnePlus 13 all outmatch the Phone 3 when it comes to taking photos and videos, and Nothing still has some ways to go before it can hold its own in this area.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-nothing-phone-3-software"><span>Nothing Phone 3: Software</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="W39GgQ6ddTnKkcYWfabNRR" name="Nothing Phone 3" alt="Nothing Phone 3 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/W39GgQ6ddTnKkcYWfabNRR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>Nothing OS 3.5 has a clean interface with bold colors and unique widgets. </strong></li><li><strong>The software is fun to use, and it is one of my favorite skins. </strong></li><li><strong>The phone isn't launching with Android 16. </strong></li></ul><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Related links</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text">- <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review">Nothing Phone 3a review</a><br>- <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/cmf-phone-2-pro-review">CMF Phone 2 Pro review</a><br>- <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Nothing Phone 2 review</a></p></div></div><p>Nothing has one of the best software interfaces of any Android phone currently available.

The Phone 3 has a unique design, great software with fun widgets and AI utilities that you'll actually use, and cameras that are much better than any other Nothing phone until now.</p><p>However, it just isn't worth the asking price — not when there are more capable alternatives available. At the end of the day, that's the biggest limiting factor with the Phone 3; it isn't a bad phone by any measure, but it doesn't stand out meaningfully against other flagships.</p><p>I get that Nothing isn't chasing specs and instead trying to differentiate the Phone 3 with a bold design and clean software, and that is evident when using the device. Although it doesn't have the best hardware, the Phone 3 is fluid in daily use, it delivers good photos and videos, and lasts all day. But the OnePlus 13 and iQOO 13 do the same, and ultimately, they're a better value.</p><p>If you like what Nothing is trying to achieve with the Phone 3 and don't mind some of the omissions, then you should get the device — it is a refreshing change of pace from other phones I tested in 2025. But if you want a true flagship, you'll need to look elsewhere.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="5f3507d6-2b4a-4311-a8f0-a0537282dcc3">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YePoe5yoNNw8rzpgquX8dY.jpg' alt="An official product render of the white Nothing Phone 3"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Nothing Phone 3</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The Phone 3 isn't anywhere as good a value as previous Nothing phones, but if that isn't an issue, you're getting a great package. </p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

One of OnePlus's marketing points was that it was the first phone in the U.S. with an IP69 rating, something even the Galaxy S25 family didn't include when it launched a month later. But what does that really do for you?</p><p>Last week, I read a story about a OnePlus 13 that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/someone-accidentally-tried-drowning-the-oneplus-13-and-it-didnt-flinch">ended up in a river for four and a half hours</a> without taking any damage, so I figured I would put it through my own test by taking the phone on the lake all day during the Fourth of July. Unsurprisingly, the phone passed with flying colors. Everyone else left their iPhones and Galaxy phones on the boat, but I floated in the water, taking perfect pictures the entire day with my OnePlus 13.</p><p>What better timing to do this, too, because the 512GB OnePlus 13 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/oneplus-13-512gb-unlocked-midnight-ocean/CZYJWF7XQQ/sku/6609353"><strong>on sale for $150 off</strong></a> at Best Buy during the company's Black Friday in July event.

In addition to the longest software update commitments ever, companies like OnePlus and Honor have built smartphones equipped <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-phone-makers-want-your-smartphone-to-survive-a-kitchen-nightmare">to survive a kitchen nightmare</a>.</p><p>I've already put the OnePlus 13 in a dishwasher several times and took it in a 155-degree Fahrenheit sauna for half an hour to test its durability, but taking it swimming all day is another feat entirely. Part of the problem is that, while many phones have featured IP68 water and dust resistance for years, that durability doesn't include "water jets" or moving water, which means you're not really supposed to actively swim with them.</p><p>IP69 changes all of that, and it means taking the OnePlus 13 in a river or lake was no big deal at all. The phone stayed in my zipped-up swimming pants pocket most of the time while I was in the lake and only came out when I wanted to take a picture. Not only does the phone withstand water for long periods of time, but Aqua Touch 2.0 ensures you can actually <em>touch</em> the screen even with wet fingers. Good luck doing that on an iPhone!</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XoKsbUFQj6WFo8jqjVbRrk" name="oneplus-13-july-4-photo-montage-2" alt="A collage of four photos taken from a OnePlus 13 while swimming in a lake on July 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XoKsbUFQj6WFo8jqjVbRrk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Taking the phone in the water was a thing of joy.

When the sun hit the water just right and turned it into "Mountain Dew water" under the boat around sunset, the OnePlus 13 perfectly captured that moment, too.</p><p>As the lighting dimmed and we headed in for dinner and s'mores, the OnePlus 13 captured the mood perfectly. I love using the portrait mode on the camera for people <em>and</em> food photos, and it even captured the dock lighting for an Instagram-worthy moment.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qRYkHwyzGG2QRE8eLz5hVY" name="oneplus-13-july-4-photo-montage-1" alt="A montage of photos captured by the OnePlus 13 on July 4, capturing fireworks, food, and mood lighting" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qRYkHwyzGG2QRE8eLz5hVY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As the long day finally started to get dark, we rode the boat over to the main harbor where a fireworks show was scheduled. The OnePlus 13 ships with many different camera modes, and while I was taking photos of the fireworks across the water, the camera app suggested I switch to fireworks mode to more accurately capture the scene.</p><p>Boy, that was a great decision. It's nice to have a camera that's smart enough to suggest when different modes would be best to use, and the fireworks mode does a much better job of capturing the stark contrast between the bright fireworks and the otherwise dark lake scene.</p><p>As you've probably experienced before, the left image below isn't at all what it looked like to my eyes in real life. Rather, it was much more like the right image, and while the timing of my shot doesn't do the display justice, it still gives me a good memory to look back at down the road.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6144px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:70.85%;"><img id="cYmN5bGaWKF5vYKaGaLVBo" name="oneplus-13-july-4-fireworks-mode" alt="Comparing the default photo mode and the fireworks mode on the OnePlus 13's camera" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cYmN5bGaWKF5vYKaGaLVBo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="6144" height="4353" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We don't normally do a ton for holidays like the Fourth of July, and I couldn't be happier that I had a phone like the OnePlus 13 to take with me on the year we finally get the chance to do something as epic as boating on the lake for the whole day.</p><p>The OnePlus 13 is my favorite Android phone of all time for many reasons, but its versatility and durability are among the best reasons.

It's substantially smaller and lighter than the bigger OnePlus Watch 3, weighing 21g less, according to my scale.</p><p>Its 60g weight still isn't as light as the Pixel Watch 3 41mm's 46g, but having a bigger battery and <em>slightly</em> larger display is better than the 14g Google saved on that design. It feels like a Goldilocks product in that regard.</p><p>And while the weight and physical size difference are excellent improvements for this size, it's the physical design changes I like the most. It's also worth noting that OnePlus improved the brightness of the 43mm version over the larger model, something that's most apparent outdoors.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2uKzpibKMLd4WJmsZWrJMM" name="oneplus-watch-3-43mm-vs-46mm-front" alt="Comparing the sizes and shapes of the OnePlus Watch 3 and OnePlus Watch 3 43mm" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2uKzpibKMLd4WJmsZWrJMM.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2916" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="y7cca9nATD8fYveWMTreCM" name="oneplus-watch-3-43mm-vs-46mm-side" alt="Comparing the sizes and shapes of the OnePlus Watch 3 and OnePlus Watch 3 43mm" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y7cca9nATD8fYveWMTreCM.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="UsiEjAU8uaKLTMLDDyvTgL" name="oneplus-watch-3-43mm-vs-46mm-side-wearing-02" alt="Comparing the sizes and shapes of the OnePlus Watch 3 and OnePlus Watch 3 43mm" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UsiEjAU8uaKLTMLDDyvTgL.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The pre-installed band lies completely flat, unlike the OnePlus Watch 3. Even if you get a different band for the bigger watch, the lines on the watch look funny without a curved band. Not the case for the OnePlus Watch 3 43mm.</p><p>I also love that there's no "sidebar" on the OnePlus Watch 3 43mm, as I'll call it, that offsets the OnePlus Watch 3's buttons. This makes the design for the 43mm variant a totally uniform circle, with only the crown button protruding from the top right. This crown is wonderfully designed and works just like the larger OnePlus Watch 3, excellent haptics included.</p><p>The offset crown means you won't accidentally press the button while working out or leaning on something, a problem that happens all the time for me on the Pixel Watch 3 unless I turn it backward.</p><h2 id="health-tracking-and-battery-life-2">Health tracking and battery life</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="eGfcvfYHUEsnCNoyEy7G79" name="oneplus-watch-3-43mm-vs-46mm-display-brightness" alt="The OnePlus Watch 3 and OnePlus Watch 3 43mm next to each other, about to track a workout" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eGfcvfYHUEsnCNoyEy7G79.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While the weight and size are huge positives, OnePlus had to compromise on the battery size and health tracking capabilities of the smaller OnePlus Watch 3 to reduce its size. While U.S. customers have never been able to enjoy the 60-second health checkup feature on the OnePlus Watch 3 due to a lack of FDA approval, the OnePlus Watch 3 43mm doesn't have the feature in any market.</p><p>OnePlus tells us that this is "due to the lack of a temperature sensor and vascular health tracking functionality in the Watch 3 43mm." In other words, there's no software fix for missing hardware. Whether or not you'll use these features is another story, but they're not on the OnePlus Watch 3 43mm, while the larger Watch 3 has them.</p><p>Thankfully, workout tracking is just as good as the bigger OnePlus Watch 3, and I found no notable differences in the capabilities of the smaller watch for heart rate or GPS tracking.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WhXBRg7mS2AAFcK3NcbeGD" name="oneplus-watch-3-43mm-vs-46mm-back" alt="Comparing the backsides of the OnePlus Watch 3 and OnePlus Watch 3 43mm" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WhXBRg7mS2AAFcK3NcbeGD.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="njWi3cxkX7MAMi66gFT4Pa" name="oneplus-watch-3-43mm-side-01" alt="The side buttons of the OnePlus Watch 3 43mm" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/njWi3cxkX7MAMi66gFT4Pa.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>One of <em>the</em> primary reasons to choose a OnePlus Watch 3 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch" target="_blank">over other Wear OS watches</a> is its impressive battery life. With an average of 5 days of usage per charge, there's simply no competition on the market. As you might have guessed, the 43mm version doesn't last quite as long on a charge.</p><p>Instead of 5 days, you're looking at a full 2 days on a single charge. Light users who don't use sleep or health tracking features much might be able to make it through a third day, but most people won't. Thankfully, the 43mm version still uses the ultra-fast Super VOOC charging OnePlus devices are famous for.</p><p>While it's no match for the larger OnePlus Watch 3, its battery life still outperforms the best Galaxy or Pixel watches of the same size. That's especially true when using battery saver mode, which simplifies the watch by using an entirely separate operating system, all without sacrificing health or GPS tracking features. With this feature enabled, you'll get approximately a week, even when using all the available functions in RTOS.</p><h2 id="a-truly-great-wear-os-watch-2">A truly great Wear OS watch</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Qy4KXzUjCfJLJhAFFfpSij" name="oneplus-watch-3-43mm-wearing-changing-watch-face" alt="Changing the watch face on a OnePlus Watch 3 43mm" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Qy4KXzUjCfJLJhAFFfpSij.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If I had to buy any one Wear OS watch today, it would be a choice between the two available OnePlus Watch 3 sizes.

It allows the watch to remain fast and capable, all while delivering superior battery life.</p><p>The biggest draw of using Wear OS over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch" target="_blank">best Garmin watches</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-amazfit-smartwatch" target="_blank">best Amazfit watches</a> is the app selection, in addition to the deep tie-ins with Android's notification system.

The Buds 4 have more in common with the standout Buds Pro 3 than you'd expect, including a full soundstage with deep bass. Plus, they bring along active-noise canceling (ANC), adaptive, and transparency modes.</p><p>The most attractive part of the OnePlus Buds 4 are their price: the earbuds retail for $129.99. In typical OnePlus fashion, you can already save big on the Buds 4, using code <strong>ONEPLUSBUDS4</strong> on the brand's website to immediately take $30 off the sticker price for a limited time. That would make the Buds 4 just under $100, which is extremely competitive at a time when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-2025-early-deals-and-faq">Amazon Prime Day deals</a> are offering big savings on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">best wireless earbuds</a>.</p><p>That's where things get tricky. The price is both the best and worst thing about the OnePlus Buds 4. Getting these earbuds for around $100 is a steal, but at their full retail price, they're competing with OnePlus' own Buds Pro 3 for just a bit more. While I thoroughly enjoyed testing the Buds 4, I'd pay a bit more for the premium feel and feature set of the Buds Pro 3 every time.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-buds-4-price-and-availability"><span>OnePlus Buds 4: Price and availability</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WLNw6d5WNSgmVvbuoEtRWQ" name="OnePlus-Buds-4-Review-12" alt="The OnePlus Buds 4 in Storm Gray beside their case." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WLNw6d5WNSgmVvbuoEtRWQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The OnePlus Buds 4 are officially available for purchase as of July 8, 2025 on OnePlus' online store. They retail for $129.99 in the U.S. and $169.99 CAD in Canada. You can get the Buds 4 in a Storm Gray or Zen Green colorways, both of which feature metal and glossy finishes. From now through July 31, 2025, buyers can save $30 with code <strong>ONEPLUSBUDS4</strong> on OnePlus' website for a limited time.</p><p>For now, the OnePlus Buds 4 are exclusively being sold directly through OnePlus. Starting in August 2025, there will be wider availability through third-party retailers, including Best Buy and Amazon.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.oneplus.com/us/product/oneplus-buds-4" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">OnePlus Buds 4 at OnePlus for $129.99 ($30 off with code)</a></li></ul><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-buds-4-what-s-good"><span>OnePlus Buds 4: What's good</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="k7HHjogyQT8jtC8JvZPpjN" name="OnePlus-Buds-4-Review-9" alt="The OnePlus Buds 4 in Storm Gray sitting atop a OnePlus 13." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/k7HHjogyQT8jtC8JvZPpjN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Buying guides</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds"><strong>Best wireless earbuds</strong></a></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones"><strong>Best wireless headphones </strong></a></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones"><strong>Best OnePlus phones</strong></a></p></div></div><p>I've spent a year praising the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/oneplus-buds-pro-3-review">OnePlus Buds Pro 3</a>, because while they're not the absolute best-sounding earbuds, they're certainly the best value. Naturally, I expected switching to the OnePlus Buds 4 to come with a noticeable drop-off in sound quality. That didn't end up being the case — it was hard to tell the difference listing to the same tracks back-to-back with the Buds Pro 3 and the new Buds 4.</p><p>As it turns out, there may be a hardware reason for that. OnePlus is touting the audio tech inside the Buds 4, which includes an 11mm diaphragm woofer and a 6mm flat diaphragm tweeter. The brand is also using separate dual DACs, one for the woofer and tweeter in each earbud, paired with OnePlus 3D Audio and LHDC 5.0 support.</p><p>Coincidentally, those are the exact same sizes as the woofer and tweeter inside the Buds Pro 3. I don't know whether these are identical parts between the two models, but it does seem to explain why the bass and overall range feels consistent across the pairs of earbuds.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hZTTY5joSemsC9cSDmMKDP" name="OnePlus-Buds-4-Review-11" alt="The OnePlus Buds 4 in Storm Gray in their case, nestled in a tree." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hZTTY5joSemsC9cSDmMKDP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Put simply, the OnePlus Buds 4 have an outstanding range for earbuds of this price point. Music across genres sounds consistently great, offering just the right emphasis in just the right places. Listening to hip-hop and rap delivers an excellent low-end sound, and one that isn't pervasive. You actually get low-end frequency audio, rather than a bass that overpowers the rest of the soundstage.</p><p>Conversely, the same feels true for other kind of music, like alternative, pop, and jazz. In these genres, the Buds 4 put proper emphasis on instruments like piano and cymbals, as well as the vocals. They sound as balanced as any I've tried lately, right up there with the aforementioned Buds Pro 3. While I might prefer the sound of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/oneplus-buds-pro-3-review">Samsung's Galaxy Buds 3 Pro</a>, they are certainly more bass-heavy and less balanced than the OnePlus Buds 4.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="a7gsLyHu8SUR9Z6fiCRu5P" name="OnePlus-Buds-4-Review-10" alt="The OnePlus Buds 4 in Storm Gray beside their app controls running on a OnePlus 13." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a7gsLyHu8SUR9Z6fiCRu5P.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Surprisingly, OnePlus Buds 4 also come with quality active-noise canceling out of the box. The standard ANC mode can block out a ton of noise, especially when playing music at around 50% volume. Niche noise control modes, like transparency and adaptive mode, are usually where most budget or midrange earbuds struggle. Sure enough, adaptive mode wasn't the best — it <em>sometimes</em> let through the voice of someone talking to me, and other times kept blocking it out.</p><p>The solid ANC performance overall shows up on the spec sheet too, as OnePlus claims the Buds 4 can cancel out up to 55 decibels of noise while adjusting up to 800 times per second.</p><p>Aside from sound quality and noise cancelation, it's worth pointing out the OnePlus-specific features available on the Buds 4, which are pretty impressive. Game Mode from the Buds Pro 3 comes to the Buds 4, providing 47ms low-latency connectivity for gaming. You also get an AI Translation mode that aims to help you have a natural conversation with someone who doesn't speak your language.</p><p>The OnePlus Buds 4 are rated for 45 hours of total battery life and 11 hours from just the earbuds, but this is with ANC off. You can expect less than that if you're primarily using ANC modes.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-buds-4-what-s-not-good"><span>OnePlus Buds 4: What's not good</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RsthHzS2XvKcwy2FKfhbaP" name="OnePlus-Buds-4-Review-13" alt="A OnePlus Buds 4 earbud on its side, showing the ear tip, vents, and charging contacts." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RsthHzS2XvKcwy2FKfhbaP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Reviews</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/oneplus-buds-pro-3-review"><strong>OnePlus Buds 3 Pro review</strong></a></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/oneplus-buds-3-review"><strong>OnePlus Buds 3 review</strong></a></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/oneplus-buds-2-pro-review"><strong>OnePlus Buds 2 Pro review</strong></a></p></div></div><p>If the OnePlus Buds Pro 3 and the new Buds 4 are on-par in terms of sound quality and ANC, it's the intangibles that help create separation. While the Buds 4 have an oval-shaped case now, the earbuds themselves are a bit chunky. They're light, weighing 4.7 grams each, but they don't fit in my ears quite as nicely as other options.</p><p>The thicker earbud stems might have something to do with that. The OnePlus Buds Pro 3 have cylindrical stems, whereas the Buds 4 stems are more rectangular with rounded edges. They don't feel as comfortable, and on-earbud controls are much worse. Instead of a quick squeeze or swipe, you're relying on capacitive touch controls on the OnePlus Buds 4, which are frustrating.</p><p>One good thing about the design is the IP55 certification against dust and liquid ingress, so rain or sweat shouldn't be a problem.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vNqNQp5KVGzWjKMho3XZXN" name="OnePlus-Buds-4-Review-14" alt="The OnePlus Buds 4 in Storm Gray in the palm of my hand." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vNqNQp5KVGzWjKMho3XZXN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Aside from the general unreliability of the touch controls, there are some other weird quirks here. By default, there's no play/pause control set out of the box — you have to manually enable a single tap for this function in settings.</p><p>Additionally, cycling through ANC modes doesn't provide feedback as to which mode you've switched to. This is a problem now that there are four possible settings: ANC, adaptive, transparency, and off. There's simply too much trial-and-error required to change the right mode or skip to the right song, so I found myself using app controls more often than not.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-buds-4-competition"><span>OnePlus Buds 4: Competition</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4brcdp8zWdepewdn8GoPLN" name="OnePlus-Buds-4-Review-7" alt="The OnePlus Buds 4 in Storm Gray beside the OnePlus Buds 3 Pro and OnePlus Nord Buds Pro 3." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4brcdp8zWdepewdn8GoPLN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>At their full retail price of $129.99, the OnePlus Buds 4 are competing with the aforementioned OnePlus Buds Pro 3. The latter is often on sale for around $150 or less, and it's probably worth paying more for the Buds Pro 3. You get wireless charging, a faux leather case material, better on-earbud controls, and stronger ANC for just $20 more.</p><p>Otherwise, most flagship earbuds are going to be priced a bit higher than the Buds 4. The Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 cost $150, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-review">Google Pixel Buds Pro 2</a> cost $230, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/nothing-ear-review">Nothing Ear</a> cost $150. It might be worth grabbing one of those instead if you have the extra cash and a matching phone, but generally, OnePlus earbuds can hang with the best in sound quality.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-buds-4-should-you-buy-them"><span>OnePlus Buds 4: Should you buy them?</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8URW97VFFLRj5VaH7f5NiN" name="OnePlus-Buds-4-Review-6" alt="The OnePlus Buds 4 in Storm Gray on a ledge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8URW97VFFLRj5VaH7f5NiN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>You should buy these if...</strong></p><ul><li>You want a solid pair of truly-wireless earbuds for around $100</li><li>You have a OnePlus phone and want exclusives like Game Mode and translation</li><li>You need versatile active noise-canceling modes</li></ul><p><strong>You shouldn't buy these if...</strong></p><ul><li>You want your charging case to support wireless charging</li><li>You need better on-earbud controls</li><li>You can afford to step up to the OnePlus Buds Pro 3</li></ul><p>For anyone in the market for a new pair of affordable wireless earbuds, the OnePlus Buds 4 are at least worth a look.

Meanwhile, the Pixel 10 Pro and the bigger Pro XL are getting their own color lineup: Obsidian, Porcelain, Moonstone, and Jade.</p><p>As for the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, you’ll supposedly only get two picks: Moonstone or Jade.</p><p>Here's the breakdown of potential colors and storage options:</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Model</p></th><th  ><p>Color</p></th><th  ><p>Storage Configurations</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Google Pixel 10</p></td><td  ><p>Obsidian</p></td><td  ><p>128GB, 256GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol empty" ></td><td  ><p>Frost</p></td><td  ><p>128GB, 256GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol empty" ></td><td  ><p>Indigo</p></td><td  ><p>128GB, 256GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol empty" ></td><td  ><p>Lemongrass</p></td><td  ><p>128GB, 256GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Google Pixel 10 Pro</p></td><td  ><p>Obsidian</p></td><td  ><p>128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol empty" ></td><td  ><p>Porcelain</p></td><td  ><p>128GB, 256GB, 512GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol empty" ></td><td  ><p>Moonstone</p></td><td  ><p>128GB, 256GB, 512GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol empty" ></td><td  ><p>Jade</p></td><td  ><p>256GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Google Pixel 10 Pro XL</p></td><td  ><p>Obsidian</p></td><td  ><p>128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol empty" ></td><td  ><p>Porcelain</p></td><td  ><p>256GB, 512GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol empty" ></td><td  ><p>Moonstone</p></td><td  ><p>256GB, 512GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol empty" ></td><td  ><p>Jade</p></td><td  ><p>256GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold</p></td><td  ><p>Moonstone</p></td><td  ><p>256GB, 512GB, 1TB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol empty" ></td><td  ><p>Jade</p></td><td  ><p>256GB, 512GB</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>If you’re eyeing the Pixel 10 Pro in Jade finish, you might have to cough up for the 256GB model. The same goes for the Pro XL. And if you're leaning toward the foldable Pro in Jade, don’t expect a 1TB version at all.</p><p>To make things even more layered, the Pixel 10 Pro XL in Porcelain and Moonstone might skip the 1TB option altogether. On the other hand, the Obsidian version could still come in 128GB, hinting at a bit more flexibility for the classic black look.</p><h2 id="black-obsidian-wins-again-2">Black (Obsidian) wins again</h2><p>The Obsidian Pixel 10 Pro XL looks like it's getting the full storage spread: 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, all the way up to 1TB. No other color seems to be getting that kind of treatment, making this colorway the most flexible pick if you're picky about storage.</p><p>Additionally, the Pixel 10 Pro might still start at 128GB of storage, even though UFS 4.0 usually starts at 256GB. That likely means the base model sticks with the older UFS 3.1 tech, so expect slower speeds compared to the higher-tier versions rocking UFS 4.0.</p> ]]></dc:content>

We’re talking a drop from 8.0mm on the S24 FE to 7.4mm. It’s a small change, but one that shows Samsung is still dialing in the details to make the device feel more high-end.</p><p>Sticking to Samsung’s 2025 trend of slimming things down, the Galaxy S25 FE is expected to follow suit. The flexible OLED ditching the usual rigid layers (hard substrates) is what’s making that thinner design possible.</p><h2 id="slimmer-than-ever-2">Slimmer than ever</h2><p>The key difference here comes down to the base layer of the display. While rigid OLEDs stick with glass, flexible OLEDs use substrates like plastic or foil. That’s what makes them slimmer.</p><p>Samsung’s usual play for the FE line has been rigid OLEDs. Rumor has it the company went back and forth on whether to keep it that way or switch things up for the S25 FE.</p><p>In the end, it chose flexible, partly to give it a leg up over the cheaper Galaxy A phones. And honestly, with flexible OLEDs popping up more everywhere, the timing just makes sense.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ignmNpbWJn3Strf6Xggao3" name="samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-ai-generated-wallpaper-flower" alt="A Samsung Galaxy 24 FE in the sun with High Brightness Mode enabled" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ignmNpbWJn3Strf6Xggao3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung Display is said to kick off mass production of flexible OLED panels for the Galaxy S25 FE.

The company just launched a smaller version of its latest watch, the Watch 3 43mm, and a mid-range OnePlus Buds 4.</p><p>To start, the mini Watch 3 is 43 mm in diameter (as its name suggests) and weighs just 37.8g, making it ideal for people who prefer watches with slim dials. The watch sports a 1.32-inch AMOLED display with a default maximum brightness of 600 nits. However, despite its small size, the smartwatch is designed to be powerful.</p><p>"We're bringing a smaller iteration of this device that's perfect for those with smaller wrists – but don't underestimate it," OnePlus's chief marketing officer, Celina Shi, said in an interview earlier this month.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:9504px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="dBXrdYNXmhcKtka2pSnxig" name="OnePlus-Watch-Buds-4" alt="OnePlus launches Watch 3 mini and OnePlus Buds 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dBXrdYNXmhcKtka2pSnxig.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="9504" height="6336" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The OnePlus Watch 3 43mm is built with a "dual-engine architecture technology" that utilizes two chips, similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-review">standard 46mm OnePlus Watch 3</a>. The watch is powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/qualcomm-snapdragon-w5-platform-announcement">Snapdragon W5</a> chipset and the BES2800BP MCU chip, and features a 354mAh battery capacity. According to the company, this battery will last up to seven days in power-saving mode and can be fully charged within an hour. However, it is important to note that for standard use in smart mode, the smartwatch can be used for up to 60 hours.</p><p>The OnePlus Watch 3 43mm is said to be able to track over 100 sports modes and will automatically recognize six types of activities, including running, swimming, rowing, and more.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8021px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.70%;"><img id="EPwtkrTiXueKyZDxuVEpdf" name="OnePlus-Watch-Buds-4" alt="OnePlus launches Watch 3 mini and OnePlus Buds 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EPwtkrTiXueKyZDxuVEpdf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8021" height="5350" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure><p>"We’re also bringing a menstrual cycle tracker as part of the update to our smartwatch, which users will be able to get estimated period, ovulation, and fertile times on their device," OnePlus added.</p><p>However, OnePlus states that the 60-second health check-in won't be available on this variant as it lacks a temperature sensor and vascular health tracking functionality.</p><p>That said, the OnePlus Watch 3 43mm will show up in two colorways: Silver Steel and Black Steel.

The company says that these Buds are designed for all-day wear with a "minimalistic aesthetic." Moreover, each earbud weighs approximately 4.7 grams. Volume controls on the Buds 4 have become even more seamless with intuitive slide gestures right on the stems of these earbuds.</p><p>OnePlus Buds 4 come with  Dual Drivers, Dual DACs, Hi-Res LHDC 5.0, and 3D Audio. These earbuds are specifically made keeping gamers in mind as they offer "47ms ultra-low latency in Game Mode, ensuring audio syncs perfectly with on-screen action for a competitive edge," Shi said.</p><p>This time around, the OnePlus Buds 4 have a unique feature called "Golden Sound," which is a personalized audio tuning system that analyzes the user's ear canal to create an audio profile that adjusts sound playback based on individual hearing preferences.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:9112px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="ZZdL7iCAzrkRDieSvswdfh" name="OnePlus-Watch-Buds-4" alt="OnePlus launches Watch 3 mini and OnePlus Buds 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZZdL7iCAzrkRDieSvswdfh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="9112" height="6075" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Additionally, OnePlus states that these new earbuds will adjust noise cancellation based on the user's environment "up to 800 times per second to ensure optimal quiet." These buds can also filter human voices by 200% when compared to the OnePlus Buds 3. This means you can listen to music or binge on TV shows uninterrupted in a crowded space.</p><p>"When walking on the street, the Buds 4 allows users to remain aware of important sounds like traffic or alerts, while still automatically filtering out intrusive noise like low-frequency track rumble when commuting, providing the perfect blend of safety and immersion," OnePlus added in its press release.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:9504px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="VESz5ZwGWjRXvR8Xr5wdog" name="OnePlus-Watch-Buds-4" alt="OnePlus launches Watch 3 mini and OnePlus Buds 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VESz5ZwGWjRXvR8Xr5wdog.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="9504" height="6336" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Buds 4 features a 62mAh battery in each earbud, backed by a 530mAh capacity in the charging case.

There are countless reasons why you should skip the Pixel 9a or Galaxy S24 FE in favor of this budget buster. With a deal as sweet as this, it would be sheer stupidity to miss out.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a> doesn't fail in any category. You want a stunning AMOLED display that oozes brilliance? The 6.78-inch 120Hz LTPO AMOLED does exactly that. Perhaps performance is a focal point for you when considering a new phone. Well, hold on to your hat because the 13R's mighty Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 will blow you away with flagship-level performance. Don't even get me started about the battery life and charging specs, because even the S25 Ultra and Pixel 9 Pro XL will start blushing.</p><p>Any way you look at it, the OnePlus 13R is a fabulous buy at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Smartphone-Snapdragon-SUPERVOOC-Hasselblad/dp/B0DP96J3KT/"><strong>$499.99 on Amazon</strong></a>.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="121fac69-7019-4048-a631-53c7df55d1b9" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="A display that serves eye candy, a battery that doesn't know when to quit, and a madly powerful processor make the OnePlus 13R all play and no work.

If you're outside the U.S., then the 55W SUPERVOOC fast charging support is replaced by an even snappier 80W charging speed.</p><p>Powerful performance, lovely display, and hearty battery life. Doesn't that sound beautiful already? To take things up a notch, the phone runs Android 15 out of the box and is guaranteed four major OS upgrades and six years' of security updates. OnePlus makes devices that are meant to last. The 13R has an IP65 water and dust resistance rating. This means you'll be holding on to this awesome mid-ranger for a long time.</p><p>This time around, the OnePlus 13R has a 50MP main and 50MP telephoto lens too. Thanks to the Hasselblad partnership, the results are rather amicable, but they don't match up to flagships like the S25 Ultra or the Pixel 9 Pro. Considering these are phones that cost twice as much, you can be forgiving in this aspect.</p><p><em><strong>For everything to do with Amazon Prime Day, head to our </strong></em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><em><strong>ultimate buying guide</strong></em></u></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></p> ]]></dc:content>

Google provides the best AI-backed software suite of any brand today.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You need the best battery tech, a PWM-sensitive OLED panel, and fast charging.</p><p>I didn't think I would enjoy using the Pixel 9 Pro XL as much as I did. I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">used the device for well over two months</a> when it debuted, and it was terrific; even though it doesn't have the best hardware, Google did a great job optimizing the interface, and the phone handles gaming much better than its predecessors.</p><p>Google somehow managed to deliver the brightest OLED panel of any phone. There are no issues with the 6.8-inch panel, and you get great colors and contrast levels. I like the design too; the new camera bar looks very cool, and it doesn't lead to any wobble when using the phone on a table.</p><p>It's mildly annoying that Google continues to limit the base model to 128GB — most phones get 256GB as standard — so if you need additional storage, you'll need to pay an additional $100. The battery lasts all day, but it doesn't have anywhere close to the same fast charging tech as Chinese rivals.</p><p>That said, the software is one of the biggest reasons to switch to the Pixel 9 Pro XL. Google did all the right things with its UI, and the phone runs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-review">Android 16</a>. You also get a great AI suite of utilities, and good customizability. The cameras continue to be great, and while Google doesn't use the best modules, it does wonders around software tuning to deliver standout photos.</p><p>All of this is to say that I really like the Pixel 9 Pro XL, and I think you should consider <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Pro-XL-Smartphone/dp/B0D7HV78PT">buying it now it's on sale at $749</a>.

It offers fabulous performance, very good software with useful AI features, equally long software update commitment as a Pixel, and a timeless design. Some areas where Samsung should have improved upon would be the battery size, charging speeds, and the cameras, which are still many generations old.</p></p>                </div>                <div class="pro-con"><div class="list-pros-wrapper"><h4 class="list-pros-label">Pros</h4><ul class="list-pros"><li class='list-item list-item-pros'>Smaller form factor with slim bezels</li><li class='list-item list-item-pros'>Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset with 12GB RAM</li><li class='list-item list-item-pros'>New and improved Galaxy AI features</li><li class='list-item list-item-pros'>One UI update is fresh, fun, and genuinely great</li><li class='list-item list-item-pros'>Refined design with Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on front and back</li></ul></div><div class="list-cons-wrapper"><h4 class="list-cons-label">Cons</h4><ul class="list-cons"><li class='list-item list-item-cons'>Relatively small 4,000mAh battery</li><li class='list-item list-item-cons'>Slow 25W wired charging speeds</li><li class='list-item list-item-cons'>Same camera system as Galaxy S22</li></ul></div></div>            </div>        </div><p>Google really hit its stride with the Pixel 9 series in 2024. While the new design might not be for everyone, we think it looks fantastic, and we're glad the upcoming Pixel 10 will continue with it. Rumored to launch in mid-August, the Google Pixel 10 is expected to come in at the same price as the Pixel 9 but with some big changes that we've all been waiting for. It could very well be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best compact flagship</a> of 2025. Speaking of which, this makes the Galaxy S25 its biggest rival.</p><p>Meanwhile, Samsung's entry-level flagship model is often neglected, as compromises to battery size and charging speeds deter most buyers. It hasn't had a proper camera upgrade in years, which means newer models have easily raced past it. Deciding between the Google Pixel 10 vs. Samsung Galaxy S25 won't be easy, especially since they'll likely cost roughly the same.</p><p>The Pixel 10 isn't official yet at the time of publication, so we have to rely on leaks and rumors for now. Based on our expectations, the Pixel 10 has the potential to surpass the Galaxy S25 as the compact flagship king. Here's how the features of both phones compare.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-design-and-display-2">Google Pixel 10 vs. Samsung Galaxy S25: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="YwMYQmfEbzn2BzsJ5gRfcb" name="google-pixel-10-renders" alt="Google Pixel 10 renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YwMYQmfEbzn2BzsJ5gRfcb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines/ via OnLeaks)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Google Pixel 10</a> is expected to look pretty much identical to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a>, and that's alright in our books. We just got a massive design overhaul last year, so no one's surprised about this. The expected dimensions of the Pixel 10 (and, by extension, the 10 Pro) are 152.8 x 72.0 x 8.6mm. Other than being 0.1mm thicker, the rest of the dimensions are the same as those of the 9. Based on some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/thinborne-designed-pixel-10-cases-sold-out" target="_blank">early cases we've obtained</a>, the Pixel 10 is expected to have a slightly larger camera bar, which means Pixel 9 cases won't fit the 10.</p><p>This would make the Pixel 10 slightly thicker and with a larger footprint than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a>. We really hope Google makes the 10 lighter, as the Pixel 9 was nearly 200g, which was way heavier than the 162g Galaxy S25. We should also expect some new colors for the 10, along with an IP68 dust and water resistance. We could hope for an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">IP69 rating</a>, which would put it above the S25. Build quality will be top-notch thanks to an aluminum frame and Gorilla Glass Victus 2 (or better) for the front and back.</p><p>Displays on Pixels have long been a weak link. While the Pixel 9 increased the peak brightness of the panels to 2,700 nits, it still employs a 240Hz <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks" target="_blank">PWM dimming</a> frequency, which is problematic if your eyes are sensitive to flicker. We should hopefully see this fixed on the Pixel 10, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/potential-display-dimming-update-for-google-pixel-devices">Google exclusively told Android Central</a> in April 2025 that they "are aware and investigating this."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9tt5ywyBytBzTTSuhuzeF8" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-2" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy S25 outdoors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9tt5ywyBytBzTTSuhuzeF8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/the-galaxy-s25-is-boring-but-a-dbrand-skin-fixes-that">Samsung Galaxy S25 won't wow you with its look</a>, much like an iPhone, but it's something that's been refined over the past several generations. It, too, comes in multiple pastel shades, including some exclusive colors, if you buy it directly via Samsung's online store. It boasts similar levels of build quality, featuring an aluminum frame and Gorilla Glass on both the front and back. It's IP68 rated for weather resistance, and it's more compact and lighter than the Pixel 10.</p><p>The display on the Galaxy S25 measures 6.2 inches with a Full HD+ resolution, a 120Hz LTPO AMOLED panel, and a high brightness of up to 2,600 nits. The display is crisp and easily legible outdoors on a sunny day, and it has a much higher PWM dimming rate of 480Hz compared to the Pixel.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-hardware-and-specs-2">Google Pixel 10 vs. Samsung Galaxy S25: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AsbNJBPaY3XYKkQhE6bug4" name="thinborne-pixel-10-cases-02" alt="Thinborne's early release cases for the Google Pixel 10 family" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AsbNJBPaY3XYKkQhE6bug4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Google Pixel 10 is not expected to receive any price increase, which means it should continue to cost $799 for 128GB of storage and $899 for 256GB. This would make it slightly pricier than the Galaxy S25. The big change that we're all excited to see is Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/is-googles-switch-from-samsung-foundry-to-tsmc-for-the-tensor-g5-chip-a-big-deal">Tensor G5</a> chip, which will be its first smartphone SoC designed completely in-house and manufactured by TSMC.</p><p>All previous Tensor chips were based on Samsung's Exynos chip designs, which weren't really helping in any way. With a new design and fabrication partner, The G5 should hopefully be able to go head-to-head or even beat the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> chip.</p><p>Besides getting a bump in raw performance, we should hopefully see a larger battery, too, with quicker charging. The second major change rumored is the inclusion of a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-series-render-leak-reveal-identical-design">telephoto camera on the base Pixel 10</a>. This has usually been reserved for just the Pro models in the past, but with this addition, the Pixel 10 would be more Pro than ever.</p><div ><table><caption>Specifications</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel 10 (speculative)</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy S25</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>Android 16</p><p></p></td><td  ><p>One UI 7 (Android 15)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.3-inch 120Hz Actua OLED, 2424x1080, HDR, Gorilla Glass Victus 2, 2700 nits max</p></td><td  ><p>6.3-inch Dynamic LTPO AMOLED 2X, 120Hz, 480Hz PWM, HDR10+, 2600 nits max</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Tensor G5</p></td><td  ><p>Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>128GB/256GB</p></td><td  ><p>128GB/256GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear cameras</p></td><td  ><p>48MP main + 10.8MP telephoto + 12MP ultrawide</p></td><td  ><p>50MP main + 10MP telephoto + 12MP ultrawide</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Front camera</p></td><td  ><p>10.5MP</p></td><td  ><p>12MP</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ingress protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP68/IP69</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Global 5G, Satellite SOS (U.S.), Wi-Fi 7, Wi-Fi 6 (India), Bluetooth 5.3, NFC</p></td><td  ><p>5G, Wi-Fi 7, bluetooth 5.4, NFC</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Security</p></td><td  ><p>Ultrasonic fingerprint sensor</p></td><td  ><p>Ultrasonic fingerprint sensor</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>4,970mAh</p></td><td  ><p>4,000mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>152.8 x 72 x 8.6mm</p></td><td  ><p>146.9 x 70.5 x 7.2mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Unknown</p></td><td  ><p>Icy Blue, Mint, Navy, Silver Shadow, Pink Gold, Coral Red, Blue Black</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 typically sells for a lower price today, even without any major sales, making it a better value. Even the top-end 256GB variant now costs around $779.99 on Samsung's website, which is significantly lower than what the Pixel 10's equivalent is expected to cost.</p><p>One of the best features of the Galaxy S25 is its solid and dependable performance, considering the compact and lightweight design. Gaming performance is very good; it doesn't heat up as much, and the display is easy on the eyes in low light. All the cameras are great, too, but it's nothing spectacular since the sensors have been recycled from older models once again.</p><p>The same applies to the battery life, which is acceptable for the phone's size, but it could have been improved. You should still get a full day's worth of use on one charge but don't expect much more. Charging is still stuck at 25W, which is somewhat disappointing for a phone at this price.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-software-2">Google Pixel 10 vs. Samsung Galaxy S25: Software</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8nqK6fPrM96zAcwqTTxE8X" name="Android 16" alt="Android 16 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8nqK6fPrM96zAcwqTTxE8X.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Unlike the Pixel 9, which didn't launch with the latest version of Android at the time, the Pixel 10 will most likely ship with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-review">Android 16</a> this time since the stable version is already available for the Pixel 9 series.

We feel Google's AI features are more useful, the Pixel 10's design is bolder, and you'll always be ahead of Samsung when it comes to getting the latest Android flavor and features. It's going to be more expensive at launch for sure, but with trade-in offers and other pre-order discounts, you should be able to offset some of the premium.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 is a solid phone, no doubt, and it's a great value buy if you can find it at a discount during <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide">Amazon's Prime Day sale</a>. Our primary concern with buying a Samsung flagship around this time is that there is an expiry date on the free use of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>, which is expected at the end of 2025. This means Samsung will likely offer certain (read: most commonly used) Galaxy AI features as part of a subscription package, which would incur an additional monthly or yearly expense.</p><p>Google doesn't really do this (not yet anyway), which means nearly all AI features on the Pixel 10 would be free to use indefinitely. That is, unless you want to use more advanced AI models, which require a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One</a> subscription.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="a6aadc3f-c91d-48cb-aa90-658ca0dfba05">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/s9GUjxWjwvBNCNBC552HKi.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy S25"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy S25</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Pocket rocket</strong></em></p><p>The Galaxy S25 is a dependable flagship from Samsung, that's now selling for a better price than when it launched.

The latest buzz claims the Ultra model might be getting an upgrade to its 3x zoom camera.</p><p>New details from Ice Universe on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/5673255066/PzEo0uobY" target="_blank">Weibo</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s26-ultra-camera-design-upgrade-leak-3574334/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>) give us a clearer look at what Samsung is cooking up for the Galaxy S26 Ultra’s camera gear.</p><p>As per the rumor, Samsung is sticking with the tried-and-true for the Galaxy S26 Ultra. This means we can expect the same 200MP main camera and 50MP 5x zoom lens, just like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.galaxyclub.nl/samsung/galaxy-s26-ultra/" target="_blank">previous rumors said</a>.</p><p>However, Ice Universe says the 3x telephoto camera is getting a noticeable upgrade to 12MP. For context, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra rocks a 10MP lens for its 3x zoom. If the latest leak checks out, it will be a small but meaningful upgrade, especially for fans of crisp portraits and zoom shots.</p><p>Furthermore, the Galaxy S26 Ultra is likely keeping its usual 5,000mAh battery, but charging might finally get the upgrade fans have been waiting for. While Samsung has been stuck at 45W for years, word is the S26 Ultra could crank it up to something that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s26-ultra-stagnant-hardware-changes-rumored">brings it more in line with the fast-charging heavyweights</a> out there.</p><h2 id="slimmer-but-still-stacked-2">Slimmer but still stacked</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ZJJVz5vaBEyU9R8cjLBWd4" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Ultra-S25-Plus-and-S25-camera-islands-03" alt="Looking at the raised camera lenses on the back of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra with the Galaxy S25 Plus and Galaxy S25 in the background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZJJVz5vaBEyU9R8cjLBWd4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One standout potential change is in the body itself. Ice Universe claims the S26 Ultra is slimming down, landing somewhere in the 7.xmm range. That’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-is-trying-to-make-the-galaxy-s26-ultra-thinner-with-new-camera-lenses">noticeably thinner than the S25 Ultra’s 8.2mm frame</a>.</p><p>Packing the same 5,000mAh battery into a much slimmer frame isn’t exactly an easy feat, and if Samsung pulls it off, it’s a pretty big win for design and hardware engineering. Still, for power users chasing all-day juice, a bigger battery would’ve been the real dream.</p><p>In a separate report, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2025/07/samsung-galaxy-s26-ultra-key-specs-upgrades-leak.html" target="_blank">Android Headlines</a> claims the Galaxy S26 Ultra is getting a front camera upgrade. The exact specs are still under wraps for now, but something better definitely seems to be in the pipeline.</p><p>On top of that, the outlet says the 200MP main camera is expected to get a new and likely improved lens, plus a fresh laser autofocus sensor designed to lock focus faster and more reliably.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Hardware that screams, “We’ve paid attention to detail, fit, and finish.” It is in that beauty that the functionality is often hidden, delivering explosive results.</p><p>Bowers & Wilkins' latest Px7 S3 over-ear headphones could have been named the “007.”. Everything about them feels premium, like Bond’s Aston Martin Vanquish. They wear like one of his bespoke suits, comfortable over long hours, while looking every bit the part.</p><p>The Px7 also boast versatile functionality, like a watch or pen that Bond’s weapons/gadgets guy, Q, would give you. Most importantly, sonically, they’re as engrossing and smooth as Adele’s delivery of the “Skyfall” theme song.</p><p>As they say, “the Bond despot is in the details,” so let’s break down what makes Bowers & Wilkins' latest generation of the <del>007</del> Px7 series a welcome and worthy addition to your options for best-in-class noise-canceling over-ear headphones.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-bowers-wilkins-px7-s3-price-and-availability"><span>Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3: Price and availability</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="LNiAQFbguKvZoJNJfu4RTi" name="bowers-and-wilkins-Px7-S3-in-case.JPG" alt="Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3 shown with case open and accessories lid closed" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LNiAQFbguKvZoJNJfu4RTi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3 was launched in April 2025 outside the US and Latin America. On May 10th, 2025, Bowers & Wilkins announced U.S. availability, beginning with pre-orders. It's widely available now for $449 in Anthracite Black, Indigo Blue, and Canvas White.</p><p>Note that the previous model took five months post-launch to see a $50 price drop on Amazon.

Most recently, one of my favorite headphone cases was for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/noble-fokus-apollo-review" target="_blank">Noble Focus Apollo</a>, partially because I like how they created the pocket to stow cables. I’m no fan of those mesh pockets in the lids of some products.</p><p>The Px7 S3 improves on that by offering a smaller case with cable storage featuring a magnetic lid that keeps things looking nice and tidy inside. My only complaint is the lack of a lanyard attachment.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="ya4345UcWi9W52Kzn42dWb" name="bowers-and-wilkins-Px7-S3-case-accessories.JPG" alt="Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3 in their case, with the accessory storage flap open and included cables showing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ya4345UcWi9W52Kzn42dWb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Opening the case and getting to the goods inside, you’re greeted by two USB-C cables. One terminates in a 3.5mm male plug for analog audio, and the other is USB-C for 24/96kHz high-resolution digital audio. For the first time, the Px7 S3 features a built-in headphone amplifier/DAC that powers the connectivity. More on that in a bit.</p><p>Bowers & Wilkins sent me the Indigo Blue pair for this review, and they are gorgeous! From the metal backs of the cans and the hinges to the textured, woven fabrics on the cans and the headband to the vegan leather earcups wrapped around delightfully soft memory foam, the Px7 S3 is very well-appointed.</p><p>Thankfully, Bowers & Wilkins put as much effort into building mechanics and ergonomics. On the head for hours, the clamping force shouldn’t give you headaches. The hinges slide in and out of the headband with reassuring friction and swivel to fit your ears without feeling wobbly.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="xMwrp7ydon8PZxKaSn4bYh" name="bowers-and-wilkins-Px7-S3-power-button.JPG" alt="Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3 with power and Quick Mode buttons shown" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xMwrp7ydon8PZxKaSn4bYh.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">Power and Quick Mode buttons. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="N2Yw4Y3AAtwAFpPxvty7Uh" name="bowers-and-wilkins-Px7-S3-playback-controls.JPG" alt="Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3 with playback controls shown" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N2Yw4Y3AAtwAFpPxvty7Uh.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3 with playback controls. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="oVSbnq7icC4BHa5qhxzm5i" name="bowers-and-wilkins-Px7-S3-case-beauty-shot.JPG" alt="Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3 closed case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oVSbnq7icC4BHa5qhxzm5i.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3 closed case. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="psxwhJvjaSQc5HCT7Jt5wi" name="bowers-and-wilkins-Px7-S3-magnetic-lid-accessories-inside.JPG" alt="Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3 with bundled cables shown" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/psxwhJvjaSQc5HCT7Jt5wi.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3 with bundled cables. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="9SAUbotLaUSfgzdayBZSqi" name="bowers-and-wilkins-Px7-S3-empty-case.JPG" alt="Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3 with case magnetic lid for accessories shown closed" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9SAUbotLaUSfgzdayBZSqi.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3 with case magnetic lid for accessories. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>One aspect of the build quality that I love here is the power button. With many competitors, you have to press and hold the power button for a moment, guessing whether it has been activated properly. The Px7 S3’s slide switch never leaves any doubt about whether you’ve switched the headphones on or off or placed them into pairing mode.</p><p>I have the Quick Mode button set to cycle through ANC modes, but you can also set it to invoke your voice assistant. That’s on the left can.</p><p>The right can is where you’ll find the volume buttons, with the play/pause button between them, and they all have excellent tactility.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="tnyVAMQSBW6VUHtASf5d7i" name="bowers-and-wilkins-Px7-S3-AP80-DAC-connected.JPG" alt="Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3 connected to the Hidisz AP80 PRO-X DAP via the included USB-C to 3.5mm cable" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tnyVAMQSBW6VUHtASf5d7i.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Under the luminescence of a diverse array of musical genres, the Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3 were beautiful every time. My cup of tea, for sure!</p><p>The Px7 S3 aren't tuned for reference audio, but instead provide a highly engaging and entertaining listening platform, with the DAC/amps powering robust audio, matched to the angled 40mm biocellulose drivers. Those components have been completely redesigned, with all but one element being new to the Px7 S3—a near redesign from its predecessor, the Px7 S2e.</p><p>I listened to audio in Bluetooth mode, utilizing high-resolution aptX with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Google Pixel 9</a>.

Most surprisingly, the sound quality directly from the phone was as good as it was being pumped through the M18i. That speaks volumes about the quality of the DSP and amp/DAC in the Px7 S3.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2b8m77NGRJef4HtSbRTeeB" name="bowers-wilkins-Px7-S3-on-head" alt="Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3 being worn by the reviewer" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2b8m77NGRJef4HtSbRTeeB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>All of the files I listened to were either high-resolution Tidal streams or local DSF and FLAC files. One of my favorite DSF tracks for testing nuance in the mids is Michael Jackson’s “Wanna Be Starting Somethin’,” and Bowers & Wilkins does not disappoint! A few seconds into the song's intro, Jackson’s backing vocals come into the mix, and lesser headphones don’t isolate them well enough to help them stand out from the whole mix as the Px7 S3 does.</p><p>Listening to that track also gave me a glimpse into the weight of the bass representation on offer here. It’s weighty without dropping slop all over the other frequencies.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="B3br3zdrC72BWvStoUZmqh" name="bowers-and-wilkins-Px7-S3-Google-Pixel9-connected.JPG" alt="Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3 connected to a Google Pixel 9 via the included USB-C to USB-C cable" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B3br3zdrC72BWvStoUZmqh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Dubstep, Hip-Hop, Jazz tracks, and anything with deep bass or driving basslines were thoroughly engaging and immersive. Much like the Hulk but with David Banner’s psyche at the helm of the green monster, the lows have the ability to smash, but under the Px7 S3’s authority, they are a model for power under control.</p><p>Skrillex’s “Mumbai Power” and The Roots’ “Do You Want More?!?!!” both have deeply resonant sub-bass, which is produced with delicious depth in these cans without muddying the mids and highs in those tracks. Booming 808s and dark sub-bass are both tightly controlled, with no bleed. This is evident as you listen to the bagpipes in the mix on the Roots’ track.</p><p>Overall, the treble is smooth, not analytical, which makes listening to Art Blakey’s “Moanin’” more pleasurable. There are some shrill horns in that mix, which can get a bit fatiguing when I listen via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sennheiser-ie900-review" target="_blank">Sennheiser’s god-tier IE900 IEMs</a>. This also makes listening to some metal tracks a smoother experience as you get into wailing electric guitar riffs.</p><p>System of a Down’s meticulously mastered albums are a joy to listen to with the Px7 S3. You truly get the texture and grit, the detail in Daron Malakian's fingering frets, with strong vocal representation as lead singer Serj Tankian, goes from softer singing to more guttural speed metal-style vocal delivery.</p><p>With the treble being on the smoother side, you get a more intimate soundstage that isn’t as airy or as deep as others. It’s still there, and it’s solid, and some may prefer it over larger presentations.</p><p>When it comes to nuance, Bowers & Wilkins' in-house developed digital signal processing does a fantastic job of maintaining the sound's robustness at lower listening levels, just as it does when the volume is cranked.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.44%;"><img id="CnprVjdUi8Tdors4aSQQgL" name="bowers-wilkins-Px7-S3-app-home-1" alt="Bowers & Wilkins app home" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CnprVjdUi8Tdors4aSQQgL.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="2424" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.44%;"><img id="dyLunnoGUr4FMNBDxhPneL" name="bowers-wilkins-Px7-S3-app-settings" alt="Bowers & Wilkins app home" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dyLunnoGUr4FMNBDxhPneL.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="2424" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.44%;"><img id="XEtmnDcnZHh2ys3HAPJviL" name="bowers-wilkins-Px7-S3-app-home-2" alt="Bowers & Wilkins app home, showing ANC options" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XEtmnDcnZHh2ys3HAPJviL.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="2424" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.44%;"><img id="JzZiwFWRFDiKv2sJYDeFeL" name="bowers-wilkins-Px7-S3-app-EQ" alt="Bowers & Wilkins app five-band EQ customization and True Sound option" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JzZiwFWRFDiKv2sJYDeFeL.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="2424" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>By the way, does anyone call anyone anymore? I'm not sure, but folks definitely do Zoom and other video chats, so it's good to know that the microphones on the Px7 S3s do a great job of ensuring your voice is clear while eliminating a good amount of background noise.</p><p>Bowers & Wilkins claims you'll get 30 hours out of these cans with ANC on, and so far, I've been on track to match that. Of course, you can control ANC directly on the headphones, but the app also allows you to do that, and this year, you even get expanded sound customization in the form of a five-band EQ, up from three in the previous generation.</p><p>The app is fairly basic, but that's okay because you can do a lot with the headphones themselves, so you don't actually need much in the app. The default sound is so good that I didn't find additional tuning necessary and was just fine with what Bowers & Wilkins labels "True Sound," which is touted as tuning that allows you to listen to recordings just as the artists intended.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-bowers-wilkins-px7-s3-what-could-use-improvement"><span>Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3: What could use improvement</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="LQ849a7z8n3aEU6YKFFDNi" name="bowers-and-wilkins-Px7-S3-headphones-propped-up.JPG" alt="Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3 propped up on a deck, showing the branding" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LQ849a7z8n3aEU6YKFFDNi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Editorial</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/sony-post-malone-noise-cancelling-headphones-launch"><strong>Sony, Post Malone partner for the WH-1000XM6 headphones that wrap you in music</strong></a><strong></strong></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bluetooth-audio-terms-codecs-explained"><strong>Bluetooth audio codecs explained</strong></a></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-you-need-know-about-bluetooth-le-audio"><strong>Bluetooth LE Audio FAQ</strong></a></p></div></div><p>ANC does a solid job when it comes to low-frequency sounds, but you will have some high-frequency bleed. Noise from cars, cafe silverware clanking, and even voices in the upper register, but that’s with the sound off. With your music playing, much of that ambient noise won’t be noticeable, thanks to auditory masking.</p><p>Officially, there is currently no support for spatial audio, which, in addition to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-you-need-know-about-bluetooth-le-audio">Bluetooth LE</a>, will be added later this year. However, there is a “spatial audio” toggle in the Bluetooth settings on my Google Pixel 9. Why mention this? There is some barely noticeable latency when watching videos, and deactivating this toggle helps alleviate the issue.</p><p>I also noticed that some films lose a bit of mid-frequency impact when it’s activated, which is apparent in “Thor: Ragnarok” because Thor’s hammer loses some of its punch. Deactivating HD Audio also helps with latency, which I don’t think most viewers would notice anyway. I have decades of experience in film and TV editing, so I’m prone to noticing <em>extremely</em> subtle sync issues between picture and sound.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="4Nk6r3zWB3qhfJQnNNAUqh" name="bowers-and-wilkins-Px7-S3-earcups.JPG" alt="Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3 showing the insides of the earcups" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4Nk6r3zWB3qhfJQnNNAUqh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Since the headphones don’t launch with Bluetooth LE, that also includes support for Auracast.

Things are just as impressive under the hood, as the Galaxy S25 Edge is powered by the same Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset that drives the rest of the S25 lineup, plus you get a massive 200MP camera and all of the latest Galaxy AI software features. And like many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> released this year, the Edge comes with seven years of guaranteed software support straight out of the box. </p><p>Of course, all of that shed weight has to come from somewhere, and it's true that the Galaxy S25 Edge only has a meager 3,900mAh battery. This means that the device won't last as long as some 2025 phones, so you'll have to decide if the thin frame is worth the hit. That said, for folks who love sleek and sophisticated devices, like yours truly, buying the Galaxy S25 Edge is a no-brainer. Sure, Prime Day 2025 (July 8-11) is sure to come with many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/prime-day-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025">Samsung Galaxy deals</a> in tow, but if you're looking for a change in your wireless setup, why not see if T-Mobile can hook you up with something free and fancy today? </p><h2 id="prime-day-2025-android-deals-quick-links-72">Prime Day 2025 Android deals — quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals" target="_blank"><strong>Prime Day is coming: see the full list of Amazon deals</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phones: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals?ref_=nav_cs_gb&bubble-id=cell-phones-accessories" target="_blank">major discounts on Samsung and Pixel</a></li><li><strong>Tablets: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=tablets" target="_blank">discounted Galaxy Tab and iPad</a></li><li><strong>Wearables: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=smartwatches" target="_blank">up to %45 off Garmin watches</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime" target="_blank"><strong>Most Prime Day deals are members-only: sign up for the 30-day trial</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The data represented how well smartwatches did in shipments on a global/international scale. According to the post, watch shipments in Q1 slipped by 2% YoY (year-over-year); however, Samsung saw the biggest overall drop "across all major markets."</p><p>The research highlights the Korean OEM's previous-gen smartwatches, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-vs-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7 and Watch Ultra</a>. Samsung reportedly saw a major 18% YoY decline, which topped Apple's 9% drop in shipments.</p><p>While Samsung and Apple are on opposite sides of this totem pole, Counterpoint highlights Chinese makers like Huawei and Xiaomi, which saw happier first quarters. Research states both Chinese OEMs saw a 53% jump in Q1 shipments YoY. Moreover, China, as a whole, saw a 37% boost in watch shipments, followed by LATAM with 24%.</p><p>The smartwatch market is speculated to improve later in 2025, per Counterpoint's senior research analyst, Anshika Jain. This could occur at a "modest pace," with a projected growth of roughly 3%. Jain adds that what may bring people back are the innovations and improvements in smartwatches, most notably thanks to "AI features and next-generation health sensors."</p><h2 id="samsung-looks-to-the-galaxy-watch-8-2">Samsung looks to the Galaxy Watch 8</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="pQLgepFdrm8vcqpuvqGPRA" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-7-01.jpg" alt="Hands-on with the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pQLgepFdrm8vcqpuvqGPRA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung might have to look toward its Galaxy Watch 8 models to breathe some sort of life into its wearable performance.
