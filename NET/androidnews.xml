                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google Keep gains multi-account support when the app is used in split mode on foldables and large-screen Android devices.</li><li>The feature follows the multi-instance support that Google rolled out for bigger Android devices last year.</li><li>The feature is being rolled out with Rapid Release and Scheduled Release domains.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>After introducing the ability to create two Google Keep notes side-by-side on large-screen Android devices, the search giant announced another nifty feature for the note-taking app.</p><p>People utilizing the Google Keep app on large Android devices like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> can now use multiple accounts side-by-side with the note-taking app. Imagine having two Google accounts and simultaneously having two different Google Keep accounts linked to them, and you might probably use them for different purposes. The new update allows users to view their accounts on a large Android screen and also works around them.</p>
<p>"Having two windows open side-by-side enables better insight into your notes and gives you more ways to work with, display, and organize your content across multiple accounts, " Google notes in its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/06/release-notes-06-28-2024.html">accompanying Workspace post</a>.</p><p>The shared gif in the post further demonstrates how easy it is to use multiple accounts on Google Keep when projected in the multi-window mode. Users can change their accounts in the Keep app by hitting their profile picture, similar to changing accounts in the Gmail app or any other Google app.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:640px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:62.50%;"><img id="Rk9tJqw2qB2oM3EmBfuTSi" name="google-keep-multi-account-foldables.gif" alt="Google Keep multi-account support" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Rk9tJqw2qB2oM3EmBfuTSi.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="640" height="400" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The new feature is a nifty addition to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-keep-side-by-side-notes-on-android-tablets-foldables">previous multi-instance</a> support for Google Keep that rolled out last year for large-screen Android devices. Google says the new productivity update is rolling out to Rapid Release and Scheduled Release domains. It will be available for all Google Workspace customers, Workspace Individual Subscribers, and consumers who use their personal Google accounts.</p><p>The new feature comes in handy and goes hand-in-hand with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-keep-to-gain-window-resize-feature-soon">recent window resize feature</a>, which was spotted in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-keep">Google Keep</a> app. The ability to resize windows on the note-taking app has been the most requested feature from users, and it was found testing early last month hidden under a flag. Previously, the ability to resize the window was available for the Google Calendar app.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung&apos;s Galaxy Unpacked event is right around the corner, and we expect the Galaxy Z Fold 6, Z Flip 6, and Galaxy Watch 7 series, along with the new Galaxy Ring, to be finally available to the public, as Samsung initially announced the fitness tracker early this year. Ahead of the release, a new APK teardown from Android Authority reveals the device&apos;s health-tracking features in action.</p><p>The publication has shared some of the features coming on the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a>: heart rate monitoring, stress tracking, skin temperature measurement for period detection, and snore detection. It further hints that the features were activated through the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-set-samsung-health-your-galaxy-phone">Samsung Health</a> app during the APK teardown.</p>

<p>Additionally, screenshots showcased stress tracking and heart rate measurement within the Health app, indicating that the Galaxy Ring is doing the work. Users should see a "Measuring with ring." popup with relevant animation. </p><p>Further, if users have the Galaxy Ring and Galaxy Watch, the app will inherently ask the user to pick the device that will measure skin temperature, for instance. The same goes with the Snore detection, per the shared screenshots.</p>
<p>The new features leaked through the Samsung Health app indicate that the Galaxy Ring is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-lawsuits-samsung-galaxy-ring">poised to take on Oura Ring</a>, as the latter&apos;s competition is still limited.</p><p>For now, we know the Galaxy Ring will at least come in three colors: platinum silver, gold, and ceramic black. Samsung has also confirmed that it will feature nine different sizes, ranging from 2.3 to 2.9 grams. In comparison, Oura Ring measures between 4 and 6 grams. The batteries in the Galaxy Ring range from 14.5mAh to 21.5mAh for the largest available size.</p><p>While we already know how the Galaxy Ring looks, thanks to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-ring-charging-case-rendering-leak">recent leak</a> that indicated how the charging case looks in real life, anticipation is certainly high on what Samsung will bring to the table with its first tiny fitness tracker, expected to be available to the masses later this month. Meanwhile, users can reserve the Galaxy Ring and get $50 off ahead of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-summer-2024-confirmed">Unpacked event</a>.</p>

<ul><li>Google could be releasing the Pixel 9 in a surprisingly new Pink color for the first time.</li><li>While we have seen several phones in Rose Gold finishes, Pink appears to be the future of smartphone colors.</li><li>Pixel 9 in Pink has a glossy finish on the rear and a matte finish for the camera visor, and the overall design appears similar to the leaked renders.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>We know the Pixel 9 series is coming earlier this year than its<strong> </strong>predecessors<strong>,</strong> but we didn&apos;t know that one of the models might have a surprising new color, which just leaked through a hands-on video.</p><p>According to an X user, Hani Mohamed Bioud, Google has already launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> device in the Algerian market. He has also shared that the device will have a Pink colorway, which should likely turn heads when used by someone in public.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Pixel 9 is already out in Algeria.Storage: 256GBColor : PinkI'll keep you updated tomorrow morning. pic.twitter.com/0mE1QlCbEg<a href="https://twitter.com/hanibioud/status/1807907687151071374">July 1, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>At least, that&apos;s how it appears at first glance, as seen on the hands-on video shared by the X user. While it is certainly refreshing, it will be interesting to see how well it will be received by consumers after the actual <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-event-2024-date-announced">launch on August 13</a>. </p><p>Returning to the Pixel 9 in Pink, Bioud indicates that the device has 256GB of onboard storage and the Pixel 9 resembles what we have seen in multiple <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-base-rendering-xl-leak">Pixel 9 renders</a>. The device features rounded corners next to a squared-off design overall. The new camera visor with dual cameras also appears in place with a matte finish, while the rest of the back has a glossy finish.</p>

<p>In the accompanying comments on X, when asked about the Pixel 9 Pro, Bioud noted that he has only seen the Pixel 9 and further indicated that he would share more details about Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship Android phone</a> soon. We might witness more videos of the handset before the official release. </p><p>It could also mean that we might see the Pixel 9 in action. As promising as it may sound, we must wait and anticipate how many more color options Google is bringing to the table, especially since we have already seen Pixel phones in Blue, Orange, Lemon Green, and similar variants.</p>

<ul><li>Artificial intelligence models have an accuracy problem, but models that can process documents and information are supposedly more trustworthy.</li><li>Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 1.5 Flash, two of Google's best AI models, have expanded context windows that allow it to process and analyze more data.</li><li>However, two new studies found that Gemini isn't that great at analyzing data.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google&apos;s latest artificial intelligence models can accept more context data than any other mainstream solution available, but new studies are calling its effectiveness into question. As reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/29/geminis-data-analyzing-abilities-arent-as-good-as-google-claims/" target="_blank">TechCrunch</a>, while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 1.5 Flash</a> can technically process data in large context windows, it may not be able to understand it. </p><p>One <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16851" target="_blank">study</a> found that a "diverse set of [vision language models] VLMs rapidly lose performance as the visual context length grows," including Gemini. Another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16264" target="_blank">study</a> revealed that "no open-weight model performs above random chance." </p><p>“While models like Gemini 1.5 Pro can technically process long contexts, we have seen many cases indicating that the models don’t actually ‘understand’ the content,” explained Marzena Karpinska, a postdoc at UMass Amherst&apos;s natural language processing group and one of the study&apos;s co-authors, to TechCrunch.</p><p>Large language models are informed by training data that allow them to answer certain questions without any additional materials. However, a key function of AI models is the ability to process new data in order to process prompts. For example, Gemini could use a PDF, a video, or an Android phone screen to gain additional context. All this data, plus its inbuilt data set, could be used to answer prompts. </p><p>A context window is a metric that quantifies how much new data an LLM can process. Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 1.5 Flash have some of the widest context windows of any AI models on the market. The standard version of Gemini 1.5 Pro <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-1-5-next-gen-ai-model">started out with a 128,000 token context window</a>, with some developers being able to access a 1 million token context window. </p><p>Then, at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-biggest-announcements">Google I/O 2024</a>, the company revealed that Gemini 1.5 Pro and 1.5 Flash would be widely available with the larger 1 million token context window. For select Google AI Studio and Vertex AI developers, Gemini 1.5 Pro was available with a 2 million token context window. For reference, a "token" is a small part of the data. Google says that its 2 million token context window equates to roughly two hours of video, 22 hours of audio, or 1.4 million words.</p><p>Google showed off these expanded context windows in pre-recorded demos. However, now that the Gemini 1.5 Pro model is in the hands of researchers, we&apos;re starting to learn its limitations. </p>

<p>Karpinska and the study&apos;s other co-authors noticed that most LLMs perform fine in "needle-in-the-haystack" tests. These situations require the AI models to simply find and retrieve information that may be scattered throughout source material. However, the information is usually confined to a sentence or two. When an AI model is tasked with processing information as part of a large context window and understanding it wholly, there is much more room for error. </p><p>NoCha was created to test the performance of Gemini and other AI models in these situations. The researchers describe NoCha as "a dataset of 1,001 minimally different pairs of true and false claims about 67 recently-published English fictional books, written by human readers of those books." The recency of these books is important, as the point of the test is to evaluate the models&apos; ability to process new information — not information learned through past training materials. </p><p>"In contrast to existing long-context benchmarks, our annotators confirm that the largest share of pairs in NoCha requires global reasoning over the entire book to verify," the researchers write. "Our experiments show that while human readers easily perform this task, it is enormously challenging for all ten long-context LLMs that we evaluate: no open-weight model performs above random chance (despite their strong performance on synthetic benchmarks), while GPT-4o achieves the highest accuracy at 55.8%."</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">🪄 None of the LLMs perform well on NoCha (but humans do! 🏆), with all open-weights models performing below random 😱Though #Claude-3.5-Sonnet reportedly shines in other areas, it lags behind #GPT-4o, #Claude-3-Opus, and #Gemini Pro 1.5 on NoCha. pic.twitter.com/5LF03DsseX<a href="https://twitter.com/mar_kar_/status/1805661007802728637">June 25, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Specifically, Gemini 1.5 Pro scored 48.1% on the test. Gemini 1.5 Flash came in behind at 34.2%. Both of Google&apos;s AI models performed worse than the best OpenAI and Claude models despite Gemini&apos;s context window advantage. In other words, it would have been better to guess than to use Gemini 1.5 Pro or Gemini 1.5 Flash&apos;s answers to the NoCha test. </p><p>It&apos;s important to note that humans scored 97% on the NoCha test, which blows any of the LLMs tested out of the water. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3635px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="wKHFbNCrVxCorZMzi9J36B" name="How to use Google Gemini on Android.jpg" alt="Using Google Gemini on Android" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wKHFbNCrVxCorZMzi9J36B.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3635" height="2045" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Gemini seemed to perform below expectations, but it isn&apos;t completely useless. The models are still useful for scanning through large swaths of data and finding the answer to a specific question, especially when it is confined to a single sentence. However, it won&apos;t help you find themes, plots, or general conclusions that require it to consume and understand data on a large scale. </p><p>Due to the lofty claims Google had for Gemini, this may be disappointing. Android Central reached out to Google about these studies outside of normal working hours, and they did not get back to us in time for publication. We will update the article once we have more information.</p><p>For now, these studies just go to show that artificial intelligence — as impressive as it may seem — still has a long way to go before it can usurp human reasoning. AI models like Gemini might be quicker at processing data than humans, but they are rarely more accurate. </p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung is presumably <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-supplier-launch-reported">readying the Galaxy S24 FE for launch</a>, and with the date supposedly nearing, a new leak has spilled the tea on its color options.</p><p>Industry insider Ross Young from Display Supply Chain Consultants (DSCC) has revealed the possible color lineup for the next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-does-fan-edition-even-mean-samsung">Fan Edition phone</a>. According to Young, the phone might come in five shades: black, gray, light blue, light green, and a pop of yellow.</p>

<p>Backing up the latest leak, we&apos;ve already seen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-renders-leak-showcasing-its-design">sneak peeks of the Galaxy S24 FE in light green and classic black online</a>. Renders previously shared by @OnLeaks on X hinted at a sleeker design with thinner bezels. There&apos;s also talk of the display size increasing, possibly hitting 6.65 inches.</p><p>The leak also suggests that the black option will be prioritized in production, likely because it&apos;s always a hit with phone buyers. It looks like this classic color is set to dominate once more.</p><p>Rumor has it that the Galaxy S24 FE will look a lot like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-fe-hands-on">Galaxy S23 FE</a>, but with some tweaks.

The camera system is expected to include a 12MP ultra-wide lens and an 8MP or 10MP telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom.</p><p>Remember that these leaked colors might not match Samsung&apos;s final, more creative marketing names. In the past, we&apos;ve seen colors like Mint, Cream, and Graphite instead of plain green, white, and black.</p><p>Samsung is keeping the Galaxy S24 FE&apos;s launch date under wraps, but the buzz points to a release in late 2024 or early 2025.</p>

That enthusiasm was tempered a little when I saw that the controller isn&apos;t compatible with Android; the Nomad is designed primarily for iPhones, and while Scuf mentions that it wants to bring the controller to Android devices, that may take a while.</p><p>Nevertheless, I use an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15 Pro Max</a> as my secondary phone, so I decided to try out the Nomad anyway, and see if it&apos;s usable with Android devices as well. I don&apos;t normally play games on mobile, but that has changed considerably over the course of the last year; with a one-year-old in the house, it just isn&apos;t possible to lock myself in the gaming room for hours on end, so these days, I carve out 30-minute gaming sessions on the couch, using either the Steam Deck (when I remember to charge it) or my phone.</p><p>Thankfully, mobile gaming has never been better, and there are plenty of console-quality ports available. In a similar vein, you&apos;ll find a lot of great mobile controllers on sale today; I usually alternate between GameSir&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/gamesir-g8-galileo-review">excellent G8 Galileo</a> and X3, but I used the Nomad as the default controller over the last ten days, and here&apos;s why I think it is a standout choice.</p>

<p>I used Scuf&apos;s Reflex Pro for the better part of two years, and it is a terrific controller to use with the PS5. Scuf managed to bring the same design ethos to the Nomad, and that&apos;s a laudable achievement in and of itself. The controller has excellent build quality overall, and the contoured design — where the sides gently curve outwards — is comfortable.</p>

<p>It is on the heavier side at 228g, and slotting in the iPhone 15 Pro Max with a case added another 269g, bringing it to 497g in total. I definitely noticed that heft when I got started with the Nomad, but after a day of use, I was acclimated to the weight. On that note, the Nomad scores a definite win over other mobile controllers for its ability to accommodate iPhones with bulky cases; I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/i-used-a-dozen-iphone-15-pro-max-cases-these-are-my-favorites">use a lot of cases with my iPhone 15 Pro Max</a>, and the controller was easily able to accommodate the bulky Everyday Case without any issues.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="N75wddeTBXdo4nAZ9UuSP5" name="scuf-nomad-11.jpg" alt="Scuf Nomad gaming controller review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N75wddeTBXdo4nAZ9UuSP5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Slotting in the iPhone is about as easy as it gets; the left side has a telescoping mechanism that lets you attach the iPhone securely. The fact that you don&apos;t have to remove your phone case to use the controller is a big deal in and of itself. Pairing is done via Bluetooth 5.0; the controller showed up in the Bluetooth device list as soon as I pressed the pairing button, and it maintained a rock-solid connection throughout.</p>

<p>The biggest plus point of the design is the textured grip at the back; this is similar to what you find on the Reflex Pro and Instinct controllers, and it is a huge differentiator in daily use.  The textured finish feels great, and it makes holding and using the Nomad that much more comfortable.</p>

<p>As the Nomad is a mobile controller, Scuf went with a smaller D-Pad and action buttons, but you get full-size hall effect thumbsticks, and they are fantastic. They feel lighter than those on the Reflex and Instinct, but they also get a textured design, and Scuf includes a set of convex sticks in the package — by default, concave thumbsticks are installed out of the box.</p>

<p>All the buttons have excellent tactility, and the triggers have a good range of motion. What I particularly like about the Nomad is that it gets customizable rear paddles; they&apos;re located right where your middle fingers rest at the back, and are easy to access. Customization is done via Scuf&apos;s mobile app (limited to iOS), but as the controller isn&apos;t officially sold in my region, I wasn&apos;t able to install it.</p>

<p>I played a variety of titles on the iPhone 15 Pro Max with the Nomad, and the controller was outstanding. I tend to prefer full-size controllers, and while the Nomad is on the smaller size, it isn&apos;t uncomfortable at all even with extended use, and that&apos;s a big deal.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-scuf-nomad-what-i-don-t-like"><span>Scuf Nomad: What I don't like</span></h2>

<p>The main downside to the Nomad is that it doesn&apos;t work with Android devices. I connected it to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review">Xiaomi 14 Ultra</a>, and while it paired without any problems, it was laggy at times, and there&apos;s no way to customize the button configuration. If you like the look of the Nomad and want to use it with your Android phone, you&apos;ll just need to wait.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="MnKhgdyWRtBCpqKBneMjv4" name="scuf-nomad-8.jpg" alt="Scuf Nomad gaming controller review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MnKhgdyWRtBCpqKBneMjv4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The advantage of using a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-game-controllers-android">USB-C mobile controller</a> is that you can use passthrough charging and connect accessories; most controllers have a 3.5mm jack and let you connect headsets with ease. But as the Nomad uses Bluetooth, that isn&apos;t available. There is a USB-C connector on the left, but that&apos;s used to charge the built-in battery of the controller.</p>

<p>The Backbone One is the mobile gaming controller to beat, but the fact that it needs a subscription makes it a non-starter. I prefer GameSir&apos;s products in this segment; the X3 has a lot going for it, and it includes a fan at the back to ensure the phone doesn&apos;t overheat during marathon gaming sessions. It is a good value at $69, and it connects over USB-C. There aren&apos;t any customizable paddles at the back, but if you just need a mobile controller with good buttons and active cooling, it is a decent option.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want a mobile controller with excellent build quality</li><li>You need high-quality buttons and triggers</li><li>You have an iPhone with a bulky case</li><li>You want a mobile controller with customizable paddles</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want to use it with an Android phone</li><li>You need passthrough charging</li></ul>
<p>The only issue I have with the Nomad is that it isn&apos;t compatible with Android. It manages to deliver an extensive feature-set in a compact design, and Scuf&apos;s attention to detail is evident in the build quality and overall design of the Nomad. It has a distinct edge thanks to its ability to slot in phones with heavy cases, and the textured design at the back ensures the controller is comfortable in extended use.</p><p>The buttons and triggers are noticeably better than what you get with other controllers, and the best part is that there isn&apos;t any sizeable premium to get your hands on the Nomad — it costs the same $99 as most of its immediate rivals.</p><p>On the whole, the Nomad is a great option if you want a mobile controller for your iPhone. All that&apos;s left for Scuf to do is to bring out an Android version.</p>

If you&apos;re not sure if that&apos;s your particular phone or tablet, click the Play Store link and it&apos;ll tell you.</p><p>On a Windows PC, you&apos;ll need to install the Motorola Smart Connect software <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/xp8jrf5sxv03zm">from the Microsoft app store</a>. It&apos;s also a free app and takes a few seconds to install. Once you have those apps installed, follow these steps to connect your PC to your phone or tablet:</p>
<p>1. Open <strong>Smart Connect on your PC</strong>. Optionally, you may sign into a Motorola account but it&apos;s not required for pairing.</p><p>2. Open the <strong>Smart Connect app</strong> on your phone or tablet.</p><p>3. On your phone or tablet, tap <strong>Get Started</strong> under the pair a device heading.</p><p>4. Tap <strong>PC</strong> from the list of devices to pair to.</p>

<p>5. <strong>Accept any permissions</strong> needed to run the Smart Connect service.</p><p>6. Use the App&apos;s QR Code scanner to <strong>scan the QR code</strong> on your PC&apos;s Smart Connect app.</p><p>7. <strong>Accept the pairing request</strong> on both devices.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-smart-clipboard"><span>Smart clipboard</span></h2>
<p>The first thing I would recommend setting up is Smart Clipboard. This allows your phone and PC to share a clipboard, so when you copy something on one device you can effortlessly paste it on another device.</p><p>To enable Smart Clipboard, open up the Smart Connect app on either your phone or PC and tap <strong>Smart clipboard</strong>. Accept any permissions prompts that appear to enable the feature.</p><p>Once enabled, you can <strong>view your shared clipboard</strong> by opening the Smart Connect app, and then tapping Smart clipboard. All of your most recent copied items, including text and pictures, can be found here.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:47.41%;"><img id="wiZmwknwomDh4Wh4w6fd3j" name="motorola-smart-connect-clipboard.jpg" alt="Using the smart clipboard feature on Motorola Smart Connect software" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wiZmwknwomDh4Wh4w6fd3j.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="971" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When copying something on your PC, a small pop-up should appear on the bottom-left corner of your phone or tablet&apos;s screen. Tapping this pop-up will let you see the clipboard contents and even let you edit text.</p><p>There are also several <strong>alternative ways of viewing a shared clipboard</strong> on each device. On your Windows PC, hold the Windows Key and press the V key to open the clipboard manager. On your Android phone or tablet, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/top-gboard-tips-and-tricks#section-use-gboard-s-clipboard-feature">clipboard feature</a> makes it easy to scroll through your clipboard.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-cross-control"><span>Cross control</span></h2>
<p>Cross control allows you to use the same keyboard and mouse between all your connected devices. It effectively turns all your screens into one big device so you can easily click and type without having to pick the mobile devices up. This is my favorite feature of Smart Connect as it makes it easier to respond to messages without having to interrupt my workflow.</p><p>To enable Cross control, tap the <strong>Cross control</strong> button in the Motorola Smart Connect app on <em>either</em> your phone, tablet, or PC. Then, tap <strong>Start Cross control</strong> to get it going.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:796px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:82.54%;"><img id="VRxrjho7bjqv4m8tP3w8Lb" name="motorola-smart-connect-cross-control.jpg" alt="Configuring virtual monitors and devices in Cross Control on the Motorola Smart Connect software" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VRxrjho7bjqv4m8tP3w8Lb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="796" height="657" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Once it&apos;s enabled, you may want to adjust the virtual position of your phone or tablet relative to your PC. This is identical to adjusting where your monitors are located so it&apos;s easy to move your mouse between screens, but you&apos;ll need to do it through the Motorola Smart Connect app instead of via the Windows system dialog.</p><p>To adjust the position of where your phone is virtually located relative to your PC&apos;s monitors, open the Smart Connect app <strong>on your PC</strong>, then click <strong>Cross control</strong>. From here, click and drag your smartphone or tablet&apos;s display icon and place it where it makes the most sense. I like to have mine off to the right side as seen in the image above.</p><p>Once this is done, you can drag your mouse between your phone, tablet, and PC monitors as if they were all running on one device.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-use-your-phone-as-a-webcam"><span>Use your phone as a webcam</span></h2>
<p>Some laptops have decent enough webcams, but the camera on your smartphone or tablet is almost certainly higher quality. Motorola Smart Connect lets you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-device-camera-to-be-used-as-webcam-on-windows-11">use your phone&apos;s camera as a webcam</a> for your meetings or other video recording needs on a PC, improving the quality beyond what&apos;s on your PC.</p><p>To get started, open up the Motorola Smart Connect app on your phone or PC, tap the <strong>Webcam</strong> <strong>button</strong>, and then click <strong>open webcam</strong>. For the first launch, you&apos;ll need to click the <strong>Install</strong> button on your PC to install the webcam drivers.</p><p>Once this is done, click the <strong>Webcam button</strong>, then click <strong>open webcam. </strong>Tap the <strong>accept button</strong> on your phone to begin the webcam stream.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="B7bHpPQwQjdfk2VV8ufC3S" name="spigen-o-mag-ring-webcam-mount-on-monitor-using-motorola-edge-plus-2023.jpg" alt="Using the Spigen O-Mag Ring phone webcam mount with a Motorola Edge Plus (2023)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B7bHpPQwQjdfk2VV8ufC3S.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>By default, the webcam feature uses the rear camera on your smartphone. If you want to switch to the front camera, tap the <strong>swap icon</strong> underneath the camera zoom button. It looks like two arrows moving in a circle.</p><p>If you&apos;re using the rear camera, you can turn on the flash as a fill light by tapping the <strong>studio light button</strong>. This feature is not available on the front camera.</p><p>To end the webcam session, tap the<strong> blue camera icon</strong> on the bottom.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1085px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:84.06%;"><img id="w7AHNc6MADyPJKQq8fARWD" name="motorola-smart-connect-webcam.jpg" alt="Using the webcam function on Motorola Smart Connect software" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/w7AHNc6MADyPJKQq8fARWD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1085" height="912" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you find yourself enjoying the webcam feature and want to use it all the time, I recommend picking up this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/iphone-magsafe-spigen-ring-on-android-phone">smartphone webcam mount</a> for a few bucks. It&apos;s fantastic and makes it easy to mount the phone on the top of your monitor or laptop display.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-sharing-files"><span>Sharing files</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1410px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.38%;"><img id="q5CS6Jfhk77XWT5tvTo4bb" name="motorola-smart-connect-files.jpg" alt="Browsing files on a Motorola smart phone using Motorola Smart Connect software" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/q5CS6Jfhk77XWT5tvTo4bb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1410" height="795" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Motorola offers several ways to easily share files between your smartphone, PC, and tablet. The easiest way is to launch the <strong>Share Hub</strong> by clicking the Share Hub button when you open Motorola Smart Connect. This will bring up a small floating window on your PC that you can drag any media, text, or files to in order to transfer it to your phone. You can also do the opposite by dragging and dropping files from your phone into the floating share hub tray.</p><p>On the phone, you can share content with your PC by clicking the share button in any app and then tapping the <strong>File share</strong> option in the top row of icons. After that, <strong>select your PC</strong> from the list of shared devices.</p><p>You can also view the files on your phone as if it were another drive on your PC by tapping the <strong>Files button</strong> in Motorola Smart Connect. This will bring up a Windows Explorer window with your phone&apos;s files for easy and familiar file management.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-app-streaming-and-mobile-desktop"><span>App streaming and mobile desktop</span></h2>
<p>Motorla Smart Connect lets you stream your phone&apos;s apps right to your desktop in several different ways. You can choose to stream individual apps or even to use your phone like a desktop computer.</p><p>Streaming individual apps is great for when you just want to interact with one app at a time, as the feature pops up apps in separate windows on your PC. To access the feature, tap the <strong>App streaming</strong> button in the Motorola Smart Connect software on your PC, then select an app to stream.</p><p>Streamed apps run independently from your smartphone, which means that you can stream phone apps to your PC and still use your smartphone normally. The streamed app doesn&apos;t appear on your phone&apos;s screen at all.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1408px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="cDqw7MvPjJWJJe9BwR6Yrg" name="motorola-smart-connect-app-streaming-vs-mobile-desktop.jpg" alt="App streaming vs mobile desktop on Motorola Smart Connect" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cDqw7MvPjJWJJe9BwR6Yrg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1408" height="792" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you&apos;d like a more full-fledged experience, tapping the <strong>Phone on PC</strong> or <strong>Mobile Desktop</strong> options will give you full access to your entire smartphone. Selecting Phone on PC gives you two options: mirroring your smartphone exactly, or creating a virtual phone.</p><p>Mirroring the phone does exactly what it sounds like. You&apos;ll see the phone exactly as it is in your hand, and any interactions you make on your PC will be seen on the smartphone screen.</p><p>Conversely, using the virtual phone option "clones" your phone experience so actions you perform on the virtual phone on your PC don&apos;t occur on your physical smartphone, even though those actions are happening behind the scenes.</p><p>Mobile Desktop is similar to the virtual phone option except that it displays an entire horizontal desktop-style UI instead of a tall phone display. This is great for use on a secondary monitor and lets you use every app on your smartphone with floating windows as if it were a desktop PC.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-27">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Pixel 6 users are experiencing serious issues with factory resets that brick their phones.</li><li>The error message "Cannot load Android system" appears after a reset, suggesting corrupted data and prompting another reset, which doesn't solve the problem.</li><li>Google is aware of the problem and is investigating, but a fix is not yet available.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google Pixel 6 users are dealing with a new software hiccup that&apos;s causing some serious headaches. During a factory reset, some phones are hitting a critical error, turning them into fancy paperweights.</p><p>Some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-6">Pixel 6</a> owners have reported on Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/281577056?hl=en&msgid=282534526" target="_blank">support forums</a> that their phones became bricked after a factory reset, as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techissuestoday.com/pixel-6-bricking-after-factory-reset-google-investigating/" target="_blank">Tech-Issues Today</a>. Google is aware of the problem and is looking into it, as per a comment on the forums.</p><p>In the forum thread, Pixel 6 users reported that after they tried to reset their devices, the phones failed to boot up properly and instead showed an error message: "Cannot load Android system. Your data may be corrupt. If you continue to get this message, you may need to perform a factory data reset and erase all user data stored on this device."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:563px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:133.21%;"><img id="pdPg7xneEa2TjEYJ9AHwP8" name="pixel-6-bricked.jpg" alt="pixel 6 bricked after factory reset" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pdPg7xneEa2TjEYJ9AHwP8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="563" height="750" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit:  sadge pixel / Google Pixel Phone forum)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When users encounter the error message, they&apos;re given the option to "try again," but this attempt often proves futile. Additional factory reset attempts may bring up even more alarming messages, such as missing a critical file named "tune2fs" or failing to "enable ext4 verify," both essential for the phone&apos;s file system integrity.</p><p>The reference to "tune2fs" hints at deeper issues within the system tools managing the phone&apos;s storage.</p><p>It looks like this isn&apos;t just a one-time glitch. Many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pixel_phones/comments/1dm79u3/pixel_6_bricked_after_wipe_to_factory_reset_error/" target="_blank">Reddit users</a> are also reporting their Pixel 6 phones getting bricked after factory resets. Even Google’s recovery tools aren’t able to fix the problem.</p><p>We have reached out to Google for a statement and will update this article when we receive a response.</p><p>Even though Google is aware of the issue, a fix is still in the works. So, Pixel 6 series users should be extra cautious. It&apos;s best to avoid any factory resets on your Pixel 6, 6 Pro, or 6a until Google rolls out a solution.</p><p>Unfortunately, this problem isn&apos;t new. Pixel users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/pixel-6-bugs">have long dealt with software issues</a> that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/my-experience-with-google-pixel-6-two-years-later">undermine the positive experience</a> these devices aim to provide. Until Google tackles these persistent bugs, frustration is likely to persist among some Pixel users.</p>

<ul><li>The July 2024 update is currently rolling out for Pixel Watch models.</li><li>The update doesn't include any notable features, fixes, or additions, but brings the latest security patch level.</li><li>The update will arrive on watches over the next week, depending on carrier and device.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is kicking off July with new updates for its devices, and Pixel Watch owners can expect a new one to hit their watches any moment now. The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelwatch/thread/283026174/google-pixel-watch-update-july-2024">announced</a> on Monday that the July 2024 update is rolling out to Pixel Watch devices starting now and should reach models over the next week.</p><p>The rollout will happen in phases, so your Pixel Watch may not receive the update immediately, as it will depend on carrier and device. That said, this update isn&apos;t one you should have to rush for, so you shouldn&apos;t worry about grabbing it sooner rather than later.</p><p>According to Google&apos;s blog post, the update doesn&apos;t bring any new features, fixes, or enhancements. Instead, all you&apos;ll find is a bump to the latest July 2024 security patch, which should help keep your Pixel Watch secure.</p><p>The update is available for both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-review">Pixel Watch 1</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a>, and it comes with software version <strong>TWD9.240705.001.A1</strong>.</p>

<p>The update comes only a few weeks after Google pushed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-watch-and-pixel-watch-2-june-2024-update">June 2024 update</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-watch-and-pixel-watch-2-feature-drop">feature drop</a> to Pixel smartwatches, which brought car crash detection, enhanced fall detection, and more. Pixel Watch users with tattoos should also notice improved on/off body detection, which should be especially helpful if they have passcodes on their watches.</p><p>It was previously reported that the June 2024 update may be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/june-feature-update-could-be-draining-your-pixel-watch-quicker">causing battery drain issues</a> on Pixel Watch models, although it&apos;s not clear if this update addresses that or not.</p><p>To <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-to-update-pixel-watch">update your Pixel Watch</a>, or at least to check if the update is available, navigate to <strong>Settings > System > System updates</strong>. You may be prompted to place your watch on the charger for the update to install.</p><p>As noted, the July 2024 update may not be available for your watch just yet, but you can always try opening the update page on your Pixel Watch and repeatedly tapping the watch icon to refresh the page.</p><p>So far, at least one of our Pixel Watch 2 models has received the July 2024 update.</p>
