Official software reveals and unofficial leaks paint a clear picture of what to expect. But I can only solve the biggest mystery with the watch in hand: Will Gemini revitalize Galaxy Watches, or leave them floundering?</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prAP53613925">IDC reported last month</a> that Samsung's global wearable share fell from 8.8% to 7.5% since last year, with Apple (15.5%) doubling its sales, Huawei (22%) and Xiaomi (19%) dominating the charts, and Garmin (4.7%) creeping up from behind.</p><p>It's not all bad news for Samsung; <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/global-wearable-band-market-q1-2025">Canalys</a> says its Galaxy Fit 3 sales helped the brand perform quite well in "emerging markets." But when it comes to premium smartwatches, Chinese brands and Apple are squeezing Samsung out, despite it having the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS53311725">best phone sales</a> of any brand in 2025.</p><p>How does Samsung turn things around? The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/these-leaked-renders-are-your-best-look-yet-at-the-galaxy-watch-8-series">leaked Galaxy Watch 8 design</a> will either annoy fans of the old look or break long-time fans' apathy after years of reruns. Either way, if the rumored <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/galaxy-watch-8-and-8-classic-might-get-significant-price-bump">Watch 8 price increase</a> happens, Samsung will have more to prove than a facelift. It needs a killer feature.</p><p>For Android <em>phones</em>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> has been the killer app driving Pixel and Galaxy sales. So maybe the AI will have the same effect for smartwatches, revitalizing people's interest in Wear OS. But that will come down to how well it works.</p><h2 id="gemini-and-galaxy-ai-need-to-wow-people-not-just-regurgitate-the-obvious-2">Gemini and Galaxy AI need to wow people, not just regurgitate the obvious</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:900px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="pQgUuXfKVZy8QFhLoU24yQ" name="One-UI-8-Antioxidant-Index" alt="One UI 8 Watch health features" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pQgUuXfKVZy8QFhLoU24yQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="900" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung wants to turn the Galaxy Watch 8 into a daily AI companion, judging and guiding you toward better choices. The question is, will the AI underlying it work or say anything profound enough to make people care?</p><p>Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/new-features-on-one-ui-8-watch-help-users-build-healthier-habits">list of new features</a> includes <strong>Bedtime Guidance</strong> to recommend an "optimal bedtime" and shame you with reminders into better habits; how your sleep, exercise, and stress are impacting your <strong>Vascular Load</strong>, or heart health; whether your <strong>antioxidant index</strong> shows healthy nutrition; and a <strong>Running Coach</strong> that'll give you a "running level score from 1 to 10" and generate a training plan to complete a race, from a 5K to a marathon.</p><p>Plus, Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/im-more-excited-about-galaxy-unpacked-samsung-health-features-than-galaxy-s25">hinted</a> at the first 2025 Unpacked that Samsung Health would let you "get real-time insights" by asking an AI questions about your health and habits. We could even get "personalized nutrition advice" with "tailored meal plans and recipes."</p><p>In theory, this all sounds like a holistic approach to health that'll make Samsung Health better, backed by algorithmic data, accurate sensors, and LLM-generated advice.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:900px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="fvQsBhstA3e9ve4iwvA5yQ" name="One-UI-8-Bedtime-Guidance" alt="One UI 8 Watch health features" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fvQsBhstA3e9ve4iwvA5yQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="900" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In practice, people might turn off bedtime reminders for the same reason they turn off <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/stand-alerts-will-save-your-life-but-most-watch-brands-get-them-wrong">move reminders</a>: to avoid being shamed. Samsung's Running Coach will need to live up to the accuracy of a fitness watch's lactate threshold test for serious runners to care about their score; up until now, Samsung's VO2 Max score has never felt especially accurate.</p><p>And after the mess last year with everyone getting the same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-to-get-a-new-sensor-that-boosts-health-tracking">AGEs Index</a>, I'm curious whether the antioxidant index tool will detect carotenoids with precision.</p><p>I'm not trying to be cynical here. But accuracy and personalization matter as much as presentation. Will Samsung be able to accurately judge a person's heart health, or create a competent marathon training plan based on 12 minutes of running data? And will its AI coach provide <em>specific</em> advice or just spit out generalizations from Google Search?</p><p>That's why Gemini — running in the background to power these Galaxy AI tools — matters so much to the Watch 8's success. Samsung needs to convince people these tools aren't AI boondoggles with iffy data, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-connect-plus-in-depth-hands-on-much-more-than-an-ai-unfortunately">Garmin Connect Plus</a> chatbot. If Samsung decides to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/i-think-samsung-health-likely-to-get-ai-subscription-soon">charge for a Samsung Health AI subscription</a>, the bar will be even higher.</p><h2 id="gemini-could-transform-wear-os-or-fall-flat-2">Gemini could transform Wear OS or fall flat</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:900px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="WXD5bdNwdobt6JHpSeXrQZ" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-gemini-integration" alt="An illustration of a person utilizing Samsung's new Gemini integration for a reminder on a Galaxy Watch." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WXD5bdNwdobt6JHpSeXrQZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="900" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Health and fitness tools matter to a lot of people, but people buy Wear OS watches for the smarts, Android interconnectivity, and (up until now) Assistant commands.</p><p>We know from the One UI 8 Watch beta that the Watch 8 will get new Tiles and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-set-up-use-now-bar-samsung-galaxy-phone">Now Bar</a> with relevant data you can summon with a double-finger tap. Samsung will need to prove that the Now Bar knows what apps and info you find the most "relevant." And we're sure to get other upgrades.</p><p>However, I'm mainly waiting for Gemini, which Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/smarter-wearables-google-gemini-is-coming-to-samsung-galaxy-watch-and-buds" target="_blank">confirmed</a> would arrive on Galaxy Watches. The blog post promised "hands-free assistance using natural voice commands to stay productive on the move." It gave examples like "Remember I’m using locker 43 today" or "Summarize my last email" of what Gemini can do, pulling data from Google and Samsung apps.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xK8nsr8pYWNm2VTN2yRKK6" name="Pixel-Watch-Material-3-Expressive" alt="A Pixel Watch showing the Gemini prompt for a "10 minute mile run playlist" on YouTube Music, with a Playlist button underneath it." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xK8nsr8pYWNm2VTN2yRKK6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A Pixel Watch showing the Gemini prompt for a "10 minute mile run playlist" on YouTube Music, with a Playlist button underneath it. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This sounds futuristic as heck and could wow people who rely on basic Assistant commands (or Siri). But it will come down to execution.</p><p>How well will Gemini recognize commands specific to watches and watch apps? Will commands be effective outside of the core Samsung and Google apps? Will Gemini use more battery life than Assistant did? Can you use Gemini Live on your watch?</p><p>Most importantly, will the newer Galaxy Watches have any advanced, on-device Gemini smarts with the newest Exynos chips, or is it all dependent upon your Galaxy phone? People need a reason to upgrade from their old Galaxy Watch, or <em>not</em> to buy the older <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Watch 7</a> for significantly less.</p><p>I'm also curious if Google is holding anything back with Gemini for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Pixel Watch 4</a>, leaving the Galaxy Watch 8 waiting a couple of months longer for this killer feature. Thankfully, we'll find out soon what Samsung and Google have up their metaphorical sleeves! Hopefully, it's enough to get the AI-obsessed public interested in their watches again.</p><p>But if Gemini on Wear OS is a pedestrian upgrade over Assistant, people will keep migrating to other brands that offer better battery life, advanced fitness training, or other perks.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming smartwatch, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p> ]]></dc:content>

Additionally, users will soon notice new listening controls on mobile. These controls will be placed at the top of the playlist, so users can "steer the vibe of their discovery."</p><p>The post says that users can "choose up to five genres," which are already personalized based on your listening history. When chosen, Discover Weekly will provide a brand new selection of 30 songs.</p><p>These updates are rolling out for Premium users this week.</p><p>The celebrations continue as Spotify takes a look back at 10 years of Discover Weekly. Designed to bring users music they might like to listen to, users have streamed over 100 billion tracks in Discover Weekly. This huge number has some special modifiers, according to Spotify. Discover Weekly has enabled listeners to discover more than 56 million new artists per week (average). Additionally, in just one year, Spotify says users saved over 556 million songs found through Discover Weekly.</p><p>Also, Discover Weekly appears to have helped new artists find more ears.

With rising artists, there are also rising genres, which Spotify says are spearheaded by Amapiano.</p><p>Artists who've been spotted reaching new audiences include BL3SS, Djo, Goldford, Lola Young, and Mark Ambor.</p><p>Spotify reiterates that Discover Weekly refreshes its content every Monday. If you've never engaged with it before, now's the time. You can find your personal Discover Weekly selection in the "Made for You" tab (just make sure you're updated).</p><p>Let's not forget <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify/spotify-dj-voice-song-requests-premium-details">Spotify's AI DJ</a>, which is an extension of the platform's interest in delivering users personalized music.

I currently don't have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">OnePlus phone</a>. And while I can't prove all the things that OnePlus is alleged to be doing, I can still tell you that this is probably true. Then again, it's also true that the phone I am using (a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-review">Motorola Razr</a> or a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>) is doing the exact same thing, collecting the same types of "sensitive personal information," and shipping it off to be stored on a server somewhere. Your phone is doing the same thing.</p><p>They all do it, and we <strong>did</strong> agree to it in those <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/read-the-fine-print">terms we never read</a>.</p><h2 id="fear-or-posturing-2">Fear or posturing?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xETYDcczKYm6H3hrKeAEXW" name="oneplus-13-alert-slider" alt="The alert slider on the side of the blue OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xETYDcczKYm6H3hrKeAEXW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Normally, I try to stay out of politics and the constant fighting that goes along with it. It never works, and people think that one side is "their guy" and the other side isn't. To me, it's class warfare of the wealthy versus the rest of us.</p><p>China has been the hot button for a while. The last U.S. administration <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/a-tiktok-ban-isnt-about-privacy-its-about-politics">didn't like it any better</a> than the current one. China is legitimately becoming an economic powerhouse that threatens the United States, and nobody who might get blamed for it likes it very much.</p><p>We've seen Chinese companies <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/huawei-losing-access-android-updates-google-support-after-trump-trade-ban">blacklisted and banned</a>, we've seen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/biden-administration-reverses-xiaomis-us-trading-ban">threats of the same</a> for others. These companies aren't doing anything different than the companies that aren't on the chopping block; they just contribute to the Chinese economy in ways that Google or Apple do not.</p><p>In this case, OnePlus is collecting the same type of data that any other phone is collecting and likely sending it off to servers in France or Iowa or somewhere. These servers are likely administered by people who work for or with OnePlus, a Shenzhen-based phone maker.</p><p>Someone in China likely has access to that data regardless of where the server lives. And yes, we checked and have seen no indication that the data goes directly to China.</p><p>We also reached out to OnePlus about the allegations, but we have yet to hear back at the time of publication.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1181px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:23.96%;"><img id="rNqzR5KdEpoW2fg7fWSSoW" name="OnePlus-wireshark" alt="OnePlus data destinations via Wireshark, with traffic from ByteDance's CapCut software highlighted" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rNqzR5KdEpoW2fg7fWSSoW.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1181" height="283" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A table showing OnePlus data destinations, via Wireshark. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>OnePlus isn't likely to do anything out of the ordinary with this data. That doesn't mean the ordinary is good — big tech companies <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/does-google-collect-too-much-our-personal-info">collect far too much personal information</a> whenever we allow them to do it.</p><p>The user data also isn't going directly to some sort of secret communist Chinese spy agency. It's just being collected so OnePlus can try to sell you more stuff or build a better <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-get-ai-powered-suggested-replies-for-messaging">AI-powered piece of software</a>. Again, just like Amazon or Meta does.</p><p>The current administration likes to say they are tough on China. They don't mean the people of China; they mean the government and the companies it uses to bolster the Chinese presence on the world stage.</p><p>If OnePlus were based in Oklahoma or even Saskatchewan, nobody would bat an eye about it collecting the same amount and types of data that everyone else does. The one thing the government needs to do is protect us, and giving a free pass to a company that isn't contributing to the new bad guy on the block isn't doing it. If it's bad when OnePlus is doing it, it's also bad when Samsung does it.</p><p>But I digress. In a few years, we get to elect another set of politicians who will do the same thing.</p> ]]></dc:content>

I just got started with the smart lock, and it does everything I need in a retrofit solution — it's convenient to install, connects to every smart home protocol, and has a modern design that doesn't look tacky in the least.</p><p>Nuki is a European brand, and it is now making its debut in the U.S. with the Smart Lock. The local is designed to be installed over existing single-cylinder deadbolts, and it has Matter integration alongside Apple Home, Google Home, Alexa, SmartThings, and Home Assistant. Basically, you can control the lock with just about any smart home standard you use.</p><p>Interestingly, the Smart Lock <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F7HKRWNV">costs just $159 on Amazon U.S.</a>; this is a different model to the Smart Lock Pro that sells for €269 ($317) in European countries. Both models use Nuki's new brushless motor and have Matter over Thread integration, but the Pro includes adjustable speed modes, has a sleeker design, and comes with free access the app.</p><p>The U.S. model, meanwhile, needs a $5.90 monthly Nuki Premium subscription to unlock remote access and additional features. That said, if you activate the Smart Lock in the U.S. before September 30, you get lifetime access to Nuki Premium without any additional cost.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="mcZnbjV4WN5CxShcBRWEaW" name="Nuki Smart Lock" alt="Nuki Smart Lock" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mcZnbjV4WN5CxShcBRWEaW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'll share a detailed review of the smart lock in the coming weeks, but the key takeaway is that the Smart Lock is incredibly easy to use, has extensive customizability, and the built-in battery is designed to last six months between charges. The lock itself has a custom magnetic connector, but the other end has a standard USB-C port, and I charged it with a power bank without any issues.</p><p>Nuki's app is easily one of the best around, and it has an extensive feature-set. Honestly, it's great to use a smart home product with sensible privacy controls and easy customizability, and Nuki did all the right things in this area. The Smart Lock is a great addition to this category, and if you're interested in a retrofit solution, I recommend buying it before September 30 so you can get free access to Nuki Premium.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="01d2f185-b238-4c9a-bf3b-2f7d32772c02">            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F7HKRWNV" data-model-name="Nuki Smart Lock" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:83.07%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7iHSkgWNwPGMzAuVDSbMeK.jpg' alt="Nuki Smart Lock"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Nuki Smart Lock</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Nuki's Smart Lock combines an elegant design with class-leading security and connectivity. </p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

Your debit card, NFC tag, or sticker does not have its own power source, though.</p><p>Except that it does when it needs it!</p><p>NFC works kind of the same way <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-wireless-chargers">wireless chargers</a> work. Using an induced magnetic field, a passive device has enough power to send the data it contains. Here's a simplified step-by-step.</p><p><strong>NFC tags don't have power:</strong> NFC tags are passive and don't have their own power supply, battery, or need to be plugged into the wall. They're a microchip with data imprinted on it.</p><p><strong>The reader induces the power: </strong>An NFC reader, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">your phone</a>, can read the data stored on the NFC tag <em><strong>and</strong></em> has a battery. When it gets in range of the proper tag, it releases an alternating magnetic field — it "pulses" energy at a specific frequency and range.</p><p><strong>The tag leeches the power.</strong> When an NFC sender like a tag gets within range of this magnetic field, a small electrical current is induced. The physics of how it does this is pretty complicated, but the practical side means that the NFC tag's antenna now has just enough power to transmit its data.</p><p>Because of how it works, NFC has a short range. This is actually beneficial because it means that only the intended two devices communicate. You wouldn't want the cash register reading your card to pay for whatever the person in front of you is buying.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.50%;"><img id="V3ZijrAf6pU6CxYQE9hVgn" name="Inside-jerrys-pockets-5.jpg" alt="Xperia NFC tag" src="https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V3ZijrAf6pU6CxYQE9hVgn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="532" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure><p>You can manipulate the frequency of the magnetic field from the reader to change the range, which is what the NFC Forum has done with Release 15. Because the range is spherical (extending in all directions), it means the tag's antenna is powered without the alignment being critical; your phone can pay for your smoothie without being in the perfect spot.</p><p>If you've ever tried to buy a Coke from a vending machine using NFC while your hands were full, you know how important this is.</p><p>NFC uses the principle that the tag is simply a small antenna that can harvest the energy it needs to send the data it holds. Software on the device that is doing the reading, like a phone or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">a watch</a>, initiates this transfer and decides what to do with the data.</p><p>NFC tags are used for payments, but also have plenty of other applications. You can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/how-to-use-fast-pair-headphones-chromebooks">pair Bluetooth devices using NFC</a> or even unlock the door of your hotel room with a tag embedded inside a keycard.</p><p>It's pretty cool technology that we usually never think about.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The key points of the Magic V5 concern its build. Honor states the phone features a shock-absorbing structure, which gives it that lightweight, yet durable feel. With a weight of 217g, Honor says the Magic V5 has achieved 8.8mm when folded.</p><p>Of course, when opened fully, the Magic V5 achieves 4.1mm in thinness.</p><p>Into the specs, when fully expanded, the Magic V5 delivers a 7.9-inch LTPO display with a 120Hz max refresh rate. Honor says its foldable can reach 5,000nits of peak brightness alongside 4,320Hz ultra-high frequency <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">for PWM dimming</a>. On the front, the V5 features a 6.4-inch cover display, which also reaches a 120Hz refresh rate for smooth usage without opening the device. The cover display matches the inside in terms of peak brightness and PWM dimming frequency.</p><p>Honor also rolled in some motion sickness reduction AI software with Magic V5.</p><p>Additionally, the Magic V5 sports Qualcomm's latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-chip">Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC</a>.</p><h2 id="honor-brings-the-magic-v5-for-your-memories-2">Honor brings the Magic (V5) for your Memories</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1660px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.78%;"><img id="Fa4Wfi2S6B5R5vcYYcNQrR" name="honor-magic-v5-foldable-launch-hero" alt="The Honor Magic V5 in Dawn Gold." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Fa4Wfi2S6B5R5vcYYcNQrR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1660" height="926" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Honor)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The large circular camera bump on the phone's back consists of three cameras: a 50MP wide-angle, a 50MP ultra-wide-angle lens, and a 64MP periscope. Regarding the periscope, Honor states it packs 3x optical zoom and OIS (optical image stabilization) for clear details. The company also highlights the lens' ability to capture colorful, vivid nighttime shots. The periscope lens has been provided with an AI Super Telephoto feature, which drives its zoom from 3x to 100x.</p><p>Honor claims that even at its maximum zoom, the Magic V5's periscope lens will capture clear and detailed photos. The rear camera is capable of recording videos "up to" 3840x2160 resolution, as well as boasting anti-shake.</p><p>The forward-facing cameras both come in as a 20MP wide-angle lens with an f/2.2 aperture.</p><p>Keeping you going for longer is Honor's "razor-thin" silicon-carbon battery technology. The phone features a 6,100mAh battery that's paired with 66W wired fast-charging support. Additionally, consumers can pair this with its 50W wireless charging capabilities.</p><h2 id="yoyo-ai-stands-tall-2">YOYO AI stands tall</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1194px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:50.25%;"><img id="d9PfD2mZEvFfcchWM9pvVP" name="honor-magic-v5-foldable-launch-yoyo-assistant" alt="Honor's YOYO AI assistant can help users "with anything" they need." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/d9PfD2mZEvFfcchWM9pvVP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1194" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Honor)</span></figcaption></figure><p>YOYO, Honor's AI assistant on its phones, is available in full on the Magic V5. The company states the AI is capable of helping consumers "with everything." For one, YOYO is fully integrated with DeepSeek AI to help users get through robust articles, "physical examination reports," and financial statements. Moreover, YOYO can even "remember" important dates from a document you're currently reading.</p><p>Multitasking has also been improved, with YOYO assisting users when opening up multiple apps at once. What's more, Honor states YOYO can help rediscover files on your phone even if you can't remember what it's called. All users need to do is describe the file as best as possible, and let YOYO do the rest.</p><p>Currently for launch, the foldable rocks MagicOS 9.0.1, a skin atop Android 15. Consumers overseas in China will find the device available in the following RAM/storage configs: 12/256GB, 16/512GB, and 16/1TB.</p><p>We want our phones to look good, too, so the Magic V5 is available in Dawn Gold, Warm White, Silk Road, and Velvet Black. Chinese consumers will find the device's pre-orders active for purchase.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Google focused on rolling out a more "intuitive" UI update for Photos app users when looking back at their memories. To begin, Google Photos will now display "glanceable" date, time, and location information above a photo. The post states this should "make it easier to pinpoint" when and where the image was taken.</p><p>However, the location part of it is something users will need to have active for it to work.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:607px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:98.85%;"><img id="Nytii2pr9oGgo3bw7HuHQ8" name="google-photos-redesign-ios-update-action-menu" alt="Google Photos update for its photo view places a handful of useful options into its revamped three-dot action menu." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Nytii2pr9oGgo3bw7HuHQ8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="607" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On the other hand, the Photos update is reworking its actions menu. Google says these improvements should help with its "usability and navigation." Via the three-dot menu when viewing a photo, users will find actions like Google Lens, Create, Cast, and more. Other important actions that users might need are listed at the bottom of the photo view UI.</p><p>Lastly, Google is bringing in Light Mode. It adds that Photos will switch up its theme (dark and light) based on your device's set preference.</p><p>When it comes to viewing photo stacks or bursts, Google Photos will display a small three-dot menu beside its thumbnail at the bottom of the UI. From there, the post says users will find options to change the stack's top photo, remove an image from the stack, unstack, and a multi-select option.</p><p>Rounding out the update are Google Photos' new badges in photo view.</p><h2 id="recent-happenings-in-google-photos-2">Recent Happenings in Google Photos</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:337px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:178.04%;"><img id="o8r9zG6k4RdZoayC6Pqic4" name="google-photos-photo-view-badges" alt="Google Photos now displays useful badges for live photos, backups, and more in photo view on iOS." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o8r9zG6k4RdZoayC6Pqic4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="337" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>These badges are said to give users a little more utility right from the view screen. Live photos can be played or paused via a new badge at the top. Additionally, users can change a photo's category, save a shared photo, or backup a picture.</p><p>Google states these updates are already available on iOS; however, the same package is "coming soon" for Android.</p><p>In May, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-10-year-celebration-updates">Google Photos turned 10</a>, and with it came two major updates for the app. The in-app photo editor received a refresh, bringing AI-powered suggestions. Google said its AI suggestions will combine several of the app's built-in editing tools, so users need only tap once to apply the changes for a spruced-up photo. However, users still have the option of tapping individual parts of their photo to edit those specifically.</p><p>Additionally, the Photos app supports QR codes for albums, so you can share them more easily.</p><p>Another update saw Google upgrade Photos' old HDR effect with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-now-lets-you-spice-up-your-pictures-with-ultra-hdr-glow">a better Ultra HDR version</a>.

The publication expands on this, citing an alleged industry official who states, "Technological advancement does not necessarily guarantee sales, so the company seems to be taking a careful approach in positioning Ballie."</p><p>Supposedly, Samsung has become "cautious" about Ballie, opting to take more time to reconsider its "defining" role within a smart home. The publication highlights Ballie's features, like its powerful chips, high-res projector, and sensors to assist with daily home life. With all of this, there's speculation that Ballie could run up the cost to ~$2,000.</p><p>It seems that there's concern that Ballie isn't going to offer <em>enough </em>to consumers to warrant such a high (speculated) price point. On top of that, there are questions about whether or not its features will offer anything new and interesting that consumers can't get from their phone or other smart home devices.</p><p>The publication states that there are still many questions left unanswered about Ballie and its services in a home. It adds that Samsung itself has not officially stated the cause for its AI companion's delay.</p><h2 id="it-s-been-five-years-2">It's been five years...</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hGxL9HRRceBit4bv76dS6" name="samsung-ballie-floor-hero" alt="Samsung's Ballie AI robot sitting on the floor as its user talks to it." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hGxL9HRRceBit4bv76dS6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Let's take a moment to remember that Samsung first showed off <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-ces-2020">Ballie five years ago during CES 2020</a>. To sum it up, Ballie was positioned as a new Samsung robot companion for homes. Packaged inside a cute little yellow ball on wheels, Ballie was teased to be Samsung's human-centric vision toward robots. Its tagline about Ballie said that it "understands you, supports you, and reacts to your needs" in an early promo run.</p><p>Ballie's early showing even detailed its built-in camera, which would let homeowners tap into their app and see their home through the AI's "eye."</p><p>Fast forward to 2025 (January, specifically), and we're met with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-phone-subscription-club-service-detailed">surprising announcement</a> from Samsung's vice chairman, Han Jong-hee. Han stated Ballie was gearing up for a U.S. and South Korean launch this year during its "first half." However, that didn't come to pass. Samsung even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/gemini-samsung-ballie-personal-insights-summer-details">announced its huge Google Cloud partnership</a>, which brings Gemini to Ballie.</p><p>The Korean OEM highlighted multimodal reasoning capabilities for Ballie, thanks to Gemini. Essentially, this software would make Ballie more "proactive" for whatever home task it's been given. Ballie can also help users pick out something to wear (fashion), health and wellness inquiries, and much more.</p><p>Considering we've just moved past the first half of 2025, it seems we are waiting for Ballie once again.</p> ]]></dc:content>

If you&apos;re trying to find the best Galaxy deals during the sale, start by checking Amazon&apos;s listings before comparing prices with competing retailers, such as Best Buy and Walmart.

E Ink is often lauded as the most eye-friendly type of display available, and while it certainly looks and feels a lot more natural than a traditional display, companies like TCL are attempting to bridge the gap between E Ink's readability and a traditional display's smoothness.</p><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Android Central Labs</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7WCXSEZSk3FX9EmxxzaGE9" name="android-central-labs-lloyd-logo.jpg" caption="" alt="Android Central's Lloyd mascot wearing a lab coat for the Android Central Labs column" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7WCXSEZSk3FX9EmxxzaGE9.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/android-central-labs">Android Central Labs</a> is a weekly column devoted to deep dives, experiments, and a focused look into the tech you use. It covers phones, tablets, and everything in between.</p></div></div><p>With the launch of the NXTPAPER 11 Plus tablet at the end of June, TCL is ushering in a new era of display technology with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/exploring-tcl-nxtpaper-display-tech">NXTPAPER 4.0</a>, the next-generation entry into TCL's fascinating ePaper technology. NXTPAPER 4.0 is brighter, more color-accurate, and features a slew of new eye-friendly enhancements that set a new standard for LCD technology.</p><p>Like previous NXTPAPER devices, the NXTPAPER 11 Plus features a protective layer on top of the display that's not only matte — similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-display-review">Samsung's Galaxy S25 Ultra display</a> — but it's got a paperlike texture underneath to simulate a more natural appearance. It also features three separate color modes that can be used to best recreate a paper-like experience: regular mode, color paper mode, and ink paper mode, all with a tap of the new NXTPAPER key at the top of the tablet.</p><p>Even better, the tablet is dirt-cheap, retailing for just <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/TCL-NXTPAPER-11-Plus/14687819013">$249 at Walmart</a>. The U.S. version doesn't ship with a stylus, but it's available as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tcl.com/us/en/products/mobile/accessories/t-pen-stylus">$39 add-on</a> if you want it.

It's not because more accurate colors inherently mean a display is more comfortable. Rather, a display that can naturally display more colors is best because it doesn't have to <em>fake it</em> to make it.</p><p>A non-insignificant number of modern displays use what's called color dithering to make the display appear higher quality than it actually is. This clever engineering trick flashes a pixel quickly back and forth between two colors, making your eyes see a color that doesn't actually exist. The problem is that, like with PWM dimming, any sort of quick flickering like this can give users splitting headaches (or worse).</p><p>TCL NXTPAPER 3.0 and earlier used color dithering because the technology wasn't capable of displaying 8-bit or 10-bit color naturally, but NXTPAPER 4.0 changes that. In regular color mode, you can disable all the NXTVISION features in display settings, fully removing all color dithering in my tests.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jcRRpPEA78Q" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>I measure this by hooking a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> up to an inexpensive smartphone microscope that I picked up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Carson-Microscope-Smartphone-Digiscoping-MP-250/dp/B015MS8O48/">on Amazon for $20</a>. I use this phone specifically because it's able to use 480FPS slow motion, while most flagships (iPhone, Galaxy, and Pixel) top out at 240FPS.</p><p>I then pull up several different images and hold the microscope up to the display for a moment to capture any potential pixel movement. My tests include a rainbow gradient, a grayscale gradient, three different gray images set to 25%, 50%, and 75%, plus a look at the edges of text and icons on the home screen.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="NB32RD7kUx3yVE62yr8Agn" name="tcl-nxtpaper-11-plus-nxtpaper-specs" alt="A TCL NXTPAPER 11 Plus tablet with its specs on screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NB32RD7kUx3yVE62yr8Agn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The most common place you'll find dithering is around the edges of icons and text, as well as on grays 50% and darker. In regular mode, the TCL NXTPAPER 11 Plus didn't show any signs of dithering, something flicker-sensitive users have been begging for in an era when display and phone manufacturers <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/late-2024-led-flicker-research-smartphones">entirely ignore science</a> and opt for more vibrant displays instead of prioritizing the long-term health of their users.</p><p>Unfortunately, NXTPAPER's two additional display modes, color paper and ink paper, both use dithering to achieve their unique visual effects. Users who aren't sensitive to dithering — which, thankfully, seems to be more people than not — will enjoy these other two modes for different kinds of content.</p><h2 id="matte-for-the-win-2">Matte for the win</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4968px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="j3WmYFwrd9haozqRrFUGNT" name="tcl-nxtpaper-11-plus-vs-bigme-b1051c-pro-vs-daylight-computer" alt="Comparing outdoor viewability between the TCL NXTPAPER 11 Plus, the Bigme B1051C Pro, and the Daylight Computer" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/j3WmYFwrd9haozqRrFUGNT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4968" height="2795" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Adding a special matte layer on top of a display is one of the things that makes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-e-ink-tablet">best E Ink tablets</a> such a joy to read on, and it's one of the reasons NXTPAPER looks as nice as it does, too.</p><p>Matte layers cut down on reflections and both make it easier to see the display in any light, plus help diffuse the light in a way that's generally considered easier on the eyes. In fact, these layers are often so diffusive that you can't see the individual pixels under the matte layer, even with a microscope.</p><p>NXTPAPER has, as you might expect, the most paper-like diffusion layer.

Whether it's LCD, OLED, micro-LED, or something else entirely, all of these displays see you staring straight at a collection of millions of pixels that are typically made up of red, green, and blue subpixels.</p><p>Not only does the diffusion layer help cut down on the eye strain that comes with staring directly at a light source, but it also provides an appearance that looks more like natural fibers.

That's <em>a lot</em> lower than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>'s outdoor brightness, which tops out at around 2,000 nits.</p><p>TCL could circumvent this by allowing the display to accept natural light, similar to how E Ink and RLCD work, but that would require significant re-engineering. TCL doesn't advertise this as an outdoor-friendly display anyway, though, so this wouldn't be necessary unless the company is planning to branch out.</p><p>I also found that the display's minimum brightness was still too bright for my liking, something that was pretty easily fixed by enabling the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-adjust-brightness-android-phone">Extra Dim</a> accessibility setting. Thankfully, the NXTPAPER 11 Plus doesn't use PWM dimming at all, so dropping the brightness isn't detrimental to my eyeballs. This is a true DC-dimmed LCD panel and features no flickering at all when using standard color mode.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4968px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="N2TJ6FUEkUfiZH36u48sGT" name="tcl-nxtpaper-11-plus-vs-bigme-b1051c-pro-vs-daylight-computer-02" alt="Comparing outdoor viewability between the TCL NXTPAPER 11 Plus, the Bigme B1051C Pro, and the Daylight Computer" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N2TJ6FUEkUfiZH36u48sGT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4968" height="2795" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The viewing angles could also use a lot of work. NXTPAPER's unique structure makes this challenging to solve, but given TCL's display expertise and the significant advancements this technology has made in a few short years, I'm confident they'll be able to solve it in the future.</p><p>If you plan to do a lot of outdoor reading, E Ink tablets from companies like Bigme and Boox, as well as RLCD tablets from companies like Daylight, are the way to go. Its display gets brighter than E Ink or RLCD tablets, but the display isn't able to accept natural light like those displays, so it's harder to see outside.</p><p>For indoor reading, however, the TCL NXTPAPER 11 Plus is a superb choice, offering some interesting color modes and a uniquely soft, eye-friendly image. The matte display means you can read near or under a light without having to awkwardly angle it to avoid a reflection, too. That, combined with the flicker-free, soft image, makes this incredibly pleasant and advances NXTPAPER technology in a way I had hoped for.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="2f79263a-051e-4ade-9345-a150443fe9aa">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zcr4Z8qwujAeqMm5gfzGGn.jpg' alt="An official render of the TCL NXTPAPER 11 Plus tablet's display and rear camera module"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">TCL NXTPAPER 11 Plus</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>TCL's latest tablet employs NXTPAPER 4.0, the newest evolution in TCL's unique ePaper display that features even better eye comfort modes than previous generations.

Safari already has a step up over Chrome, but Google needs to ensure that it optimizes Chrome so this gap doesn’t grow.</p><h2 id="the-iphone-and-ipad-are-bigger-competitors-than-ever-2">The iPhone and iPad are bigger competitors than ever</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TYGbC5pvc8iQYM3PiHHje6" name="iOS-Android-Notifications-2" alt="The notification centers on iOS 26 and Android 16." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TYGbC5pvc8iQYM3PiHHje6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Overall, iOS 26 and iPadOS 26 have been surprising because they feel more like Android than they ever have before.

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-phone-3-launch">Phone 3</a> is Nothing's most ambitious device yet, and it continues the brand's heritage of differentiated design along with exciting software features. There's clearly a lot to like about the phone, and I'm excited to get my hands on it. But one thing stood out at the launch event: the pricing.</p><p>The Phone 3 starts at $799 in the U.S., going up to $899 for the 16GB/512GB edition. That's going to be a hard sell considering Nothing doesn't have any carrier partnerships in the U.S. The brand has a tougher battle in its biggest market, India. The 12GB/256GB model of the Phone 3 costs ₹79,999 ($933) in the country, with the 16GB/512GB edition retailing at ₹89,999 ($1,050).</p><p>That's absurd pricing in a market that's particularly price-sensitive, and I don't really know what motivated Nothing to set the price so high. The brand sells an overwhelming majority of its products — whether it's budget phones, earbuds, or CMF-branded devices — in India, so it has a good understanding of the pricing dynamics. Yet, the Phone 3 costs more in India than the U.S., and that's baffling.</p><p>What makes the pricing hard to rationalize is the fact that the Phone 3 is made locally in India. Nothing proudly says that the Phone 3 is "Designed in London. Made in India," but the pricing doesn't reflect that. The entire idea around assembling a device in the country is to lower the cost, and Chinese brands use this strategy to great effect, selling their flagships for considerably less than other markets.</p><p>Take the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-ultra-review">Xiaomi 15 Ultra</a>, for instance. The phone costs ₹109,999 ($1,284) in India for the 16GB/512GB edition, and while that's a lot of cash, the same phone retails for £1,199 ($1,642) in the U.K. It's the same story with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>; the phone starts at ₹69,999 ($816) in India, and it costs $899 in the U.S.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="v9dbHqfdGU8orcoas8g3kR" name="Nothing Headphone 1" alt="Nothing Headphone 1" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v9dbHqfdGU8orcoas8g3kR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Every other brand understands that they need to be aggressive in India to have any chance at making inroads, and that's why the Phone 3 pricing in India doesn't make much sense. I don't even have to point to other brands; Nothing's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/nothing-headphone-1-review">Headphone 1</a> — which launched alongside the Phone 3 — is set to retail for ₹21,999 ($256) in the country, and that's meaningfully lower than the $299 U.S. pricing.</p><p>That's true of all other products Nothing launched in the last three years; the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Phone 2a</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-pro-best-budget-phone-india">Phone 3a Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/cmf-phone-2-pro-review">CMF Phone 2 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/nothing-cmf-buds-2-buds-2-plus-review">CMF Buds 2 and Buds 2 Plus</a>, and all of the brand's other earbuds are priced lower in India than just about any other country, but with the Phone 3, the opposite is true.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5154px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="XDvTUZxDVpeJUZWDwmWvJW" name="CMF Phone 2 Pro" alt="CMF Phone 2 Pro review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XDvTUZxDVpeJUZWDwmWvJW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5154" height="2903" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Then there's the question of the hardware; the Phone 3 misses out on Qualcomm's best silicon, instead featuring the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4. It is a decent enough chipset, but it is seen on devices that cost less than half as much as the Phone 3, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/iqoo-neo-10-review">iQOO Neo 10</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi/poco-f7-review">POCO F7</a>.</p><p>Nothing maintains that it isn't about the hardware that's used, but how it's optimized; the brand has shown in the past that it does a good job in this regard, but it just doesn't remedy the fact that you're paying more to get a phone that isn't as powerful as the OnePlus 13 and Vivo X200.</p><p>As someone who's used every single Nothing phone and accessory, I'm letdown by the Phone 3's pricing in India. The phone clearly has the potential to stand out, and it just needed Nothing to be aggressive with the pricing to allow the upstart manufacturer to gain a foothold in the premium segment. However, that isn't the case, and Nothing's short-sighted move is making the Phone 3 a harder sell than it needs to be.</p> ]]></dc:content>

For one, the way notifications are handled is pretty annoying. I could be in the middle of a workout, and if I receive a notification, it will linger on the display for longer than necessary. It will partially block the view of my workout screen until I swipe it away, which can be inconvenient when in the middle of a run.</p><p>In fact, notifications can be quite annoying because you can’t adjust the vibration intensity, despite the watch’s haptics being quite pleasant and subtle. Thus, I’ve had to turn off most notifications completely.</p><p>The watch seems to have trouble maintaining a connection to my phone, even if they’re right next to each other. Multiple times a day, I would receive notifications that it had been disconnected, only for it to reconnect about 10 seconds later. This is a behavior I haven't experienced on the Vivoactive 6 or Venu 3, so I’m not quite sure what that’s about.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XUyLJD5y2TkZg5i2qRFpgH" name="Garmin-Forerunner-570-review-03" alt="A notification on the Garmin Forerunner 570" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XUyLJD5y2TkZg5i2qRFpgH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>GPS tracking is as good as you'd expect on a Garmin watch of this caliber, but users may not like that the watch doesn’t support offline maps, which could be a dealbreaker for more outdoorsy types who enjoy going on hikes.

Currently, rumors and leaks point to the Pixel 10 keeping a few things from the Pixel 9 while adding major upgrades. If you're in the market for a new Android phone, you might be wondering how the upcoming Pixel 10 is expected to compare to the current model.</p><p>Based on Google's new release schedule for Pixels, we'll likely see the Pixel 10 sometime in August 2025. That's about a month away, and leaks are intensifying as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-release-date">possible launch dates</a> get closer.

At a minimum, the Pixel 10 display should match the Pixel 9's display specifications. That means you'll get a 6.3-inch 120Hz Actua OLED with a 2424 x 1080 resolution. We should also see HDR support and a peak brightness rating of at least 2,700 nits.</p><p>To differentiate the Pixel 10 display from that of the Pixel 9, Google could make a tweak or two.

Each generation of Pixel phones has received a new Tensor chip since Google made the switch to its own silicon designs. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-reportedly-closed-a-multi-year-deal-with-tsmc-starting-with-the-pixel-10">the Tensor G5 is reportedly the first chip to be made by TSMC</a> instead of Samsung Foundry, which could be a major leap.</p><p>Aside from gaining access to TSMC's advanced fabrication processes, Google may also have the opportunity to include more custom components in the Pixel 10. It will supposedly add a fully-custom image-signal processor (ISP) for the first time, for example. A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/is-googles-switch-from-samsung-foundry-to-tsmc-for-the-tensor-g5-chip-a-big-deal">leaked parts list for the Tensor G5 serves as a preview</a> of what kind of upgrades might arrive on the Pixel 10.</p><p>Considering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">the Tensor G4 is widely considered to be a disappointment</a> compared to the Apple A18 Pro and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>, this could be crucial for the Pixel 10 to remain competitive. The Pixel 9 and its Tensor G4 system-on-a-chip excel at AI tasks, but fall short in raw performance.</p><div ><table><caption>Specifications</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel 10 (rumored/assumed)</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel 9</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>Android 16</p></td><td  ><p>Android 14, seven software updates (upgradeable to Android 16)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.3-inch 120Hz Actua OLED, 2424x1080, HDR, Gorilla Glass Victus 2, 2700 nits max</p></td><td  ><p>6.3-inch 120Hz Actua OLED, 2424x1080, HDR, Gorilla Glass Victus 2, 2700 nits max</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Chipset</p></td><td  ><p>Tensor G5</p></td><td  ><p>Google Tensor G4, Titan M2, 4nm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>128GB/256GB</p></td><td  ><p>128GB/256GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear camera 1</p></td><td  ><p>48 MP, f/1.7, 25mm (wide), 1/2.0-inch, 0.8µm, dual pixel PDAF, OIS</p></td><td  ><p>50MP f/1.68 1/1.31-inch module, 82-degree FoV, OIS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear camera 2</p></td><td  ><p>10.8 MP, f/3.1, 112mm (telephoto), 1/3.2-inch, dual pixel PDAF, OIS, 5x optical zoom</p></td><td  ><p>48MP f/1.7 1/2.55-inch module, wide-angle, 123-degree FoV</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear camera 3</p></td><td  ><p>12MP ultrawide</p></td><td  ><p>N/A</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Front camera</p></td><td  ><p>10.5MP f2.2, autofocus, 95-degree FoV</p></td><td  ><p>10.5MP f2.2, autofocus, 95-degree FoV</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ingress protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP68 dust and water resistance</p></td><td  ><p>IP68 dust and water resistance</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Global 5G, Satellite SOS (U.S.), Wi-Fi 7, Wi-Fi 6 (India), Bluetooth 5.3, NFC</p></td><td  ><p>Global 5G, Satellite SOS (U.S.), Wi-Fi 7, Wi-Fi 6 (India), Bluetooth 5.3, NFC </p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Security</p></td><td  ><p>Optical fingerprint sensor</p></td><td  ><p>Optical fingerprint sensor</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Audio</p></td><td  ><p>USB-C, stereo sound</p></td><td  ><p>USB-C, stereo sound</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>4,970mAh</p></td><td  ><p>4,700mAh battery,</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>Unknown</p></td><td  ><p>152.8 x 72.0 x 8.5mm, 198g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Pink, other colors unknown </p></td><td  ><p>Obsidian, Porcelain, Wintergreen, Peony</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Otherwise, the Pixel 10 is expected to keep the exact same RAM and storage options as the Pixel 9. In that case, both phones would have 12GB of memory and either 128GB or 256GB of storage. Higher capacities would be reserved for the more expensive Pixel 10 models, unless Google decides to make a change.</p><p>The Pixel 10 may also feature top-of-the-line connectivity support, including 5G and Wi-Fi 7, just like its predecessor. The Pixel 9 only had Bluetooth 5.3 support, so it'll be interesting to see whether the Pixel 10 sports a newer spec. In terms of biometrics, we expect to see an under-display fingerprint sensor and facial recognition.</p><p>The only other rumored hardware change is a bump to battery capacity, which is said to be 4,970mAh on the Pixel 10.

The phone is rumored to add a 10.8MP telephoto camera offering up to 5x optical zoom for the first time. This would reportedly be in addition to a 12MP ultrawide and a primary camera, bringing a triple-camera system to the smartphone.</p><p>Rumors suggest that the Pixel 10's primary camera will be a 48 MP f/1.7 sensor, likely similar to or identical to the cameras found on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">Google Pixel 9a</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>. While this could be seen as a downgrade compared to the Pixel 9's 50MP main camera, there could be more to the story. The Pixel 9a's "downgraded" primary camera <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-9a-camera-review">actually resulted in better photos overall than its predecessor</a>.</p><p>The current Pixel 9 features two rear cameras: a 50MP main sensor and a 48MP ultrawide sensor.

Google's widely-reported switch to TSMC for Tensor G5 chip fabrication could finally help Pixels compete with Apple and Qualcomm-powered mobile processors for the first time. A telephoto lens onboard would give the Pixel 10 a fighting chance against the base-model <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Samsung Galaxy S25</a>, too.</p><p>However, it isn't time to count out the Pixel 9 just yet.

Usually, this is the time in a company's life cycle when it starts to play it safe, but the Nothing Headphone 1 do anything but. These headphones double down on what people love about Nothing, offering a unique design, competitive feature set, and an enticing value proposition.</p><p>At just $300, Nothing's Headphone 1 undercuts the likes of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">premium over-ears</a> such as the Bose QuietComfort Ultra, Sonos Ace, and Sony WH-1000XM6. Surprisingly, the Headphone 1 holds its own compared to those competitors.

At first glance, Headphone 1 looks somewhat like an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/i-pitted-the-airpods-max-against-my-usd3000-audio-setup">AirPods Max</a> lookalike.

The rectangular shape of the headphone chassis, made out of aluminum, feels premium. Then, the oval-shaped plastic window sits atop it to provide a little bit of flair. The translucency is a bit of a gimmick, as you can't really see much inside, but it's still a neat addition that matches nicely with other Nothing products.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="awEcSoSpMb8jFPtxNEjGxh" name="Nothing-Headphone-1-11" alt="Wearing the Nothing Headphone 1 while holding up the Nothing Phone 3a Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/awEcSoSpMb8jFPtxNEjGxh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Nothing's Headphone 1 fits right in if you have one of the company's phones. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Despite the loud design language, Nothing Headphone 1 is fairly compact. The ear cups and main chassis are only 78mm thick combined, and most of that are the polyurethane foam-filled ear cushions. They weigh 329 grams, which is less than the gargantuan AirPods Max but more than most other over-ear competitors.</p><p>Still, I think I underestimated the Headphone 1's thin plastic headband. While looking a bit cheap compared to the aluminum housing, the adjustable and telescoping headband gets the job done. Nothing's Headphone 1 is right up there with some of my favorite headphones for comfort, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/these-sonos-headphones-arent-perfect-heres-why-i-still-recommend-them">including the Sonos Ace</a>.</p><p>I could wear Headphone 1 for hours-long listening sessions with no discomfort, and found a good fit within seconds of putting them on.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TjPPnqVvhUA29K6WmDzrDo" name="Nothing-Headphone-1-5" alt="A tilted view of the Nothing Headphone 1 outdoors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TjPPnqVvhUA29K6WmDzrDo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Nothing Headphone 1's design isn't the only thing unique about this pair of headphones. The sound signature and audio experience is different, too. At the heart of things is a custom 40mm dynamic driver surrounded by 8.9mm of polyurethane to minimize distortion. It features custom tuning in partnership with KEF, and Nothing says Headphone 1 "presents a sound profile that reproduces music as the artist intended."</p><p>After listening to hours of music with Headphone 1, I'd say they sound generally good, but I'm not sure the above description is accurate. Nothing's Headphone 1 are tuned to prioritize the bass and lower frequencies more than mids and highs. Compared to something with a flatter frequency distribution — I often use Audio Technica ATH-M50X's for reference — Headphone 1 certainly adds its own unique flavor.</p><p>In my experience, the Nothing Headphone 1 will sound great about 90% of the time. However, you're likely to run into a few tracks that just sound off because the vocals or high-end sounds are muddied by an overreaching bass. If one of these songs just happens to be one you listen to a lot, the difference in sound might be obvious. Most of the time, you're going to get a very full sound out of the Nothing Headphone 1.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="edLhseRVCoLqKPhENoJoUG" name="Nothing-Headphone-1-X-app" alt="Setting up and changing the settings for the Nothing Headphone 1 in the Nothing X app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/edLhseRVCoLqKPhENoJoUG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The reason why this isn't too big of a deal is that Nothing is very transparent about Headphone 1's sound signature, for the most part. You can see this prioritization of lows and mids in the visual range for the <strong>Balanced</strong> EQ mode in the Nothing X companion app.</p><p>If you don't like it, you can easily adjust it. I found myself switching to the <strong>More treble</strong> EQ preset if I knew I was actively listening to genres like folk, alternative, or jazz, and that addressed some of my concerns. The headphones' spatial audio modes help add separation to the soundstage, too, and the head tracking is effective. I don't always like listening to music in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-android-users-need-know-about-spatial-audio">spatial audio</a>, but in this case, it added the clarity to things such as vocals or cymbals I was craving.</p><p>The level of control you get over Headphone 1, both in the app and on-device, is what makes the headphones great. For instance, you can choose between having active noise-cancelation or transparency mode on or off, but you can also adjust the strength of the ANC. This is handy, and I prefer it to how other headphones handle ANC modes, as it can be hard to tell when they're on or off.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yjqrgvMZRHjG45fKorx6U" name="Nothing-Headphone-1-8" alt="The roller and paddle on the Nothing Headphone 1." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yjqrgvMZRHjG45fKorx6U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Speaking of on-device controls, it's impossible not to mention everything the Nothing Headphone 1 offers. You get a paddle for playback control and a roller for volume, play/pause function, and ANC modes. There's also another button for voice assistant control and a dedicated Bluetooth pairing button. Oh, and Headphone 1 has its own on/off switch too.</p><p>I'd reconfigure the controls slightly, setting the voice assistant button to cycle through ANC modes instead. Otherwise, they're incredibly helpful, and way better than capacitive touch controls or a clunky button with too many functions. Paired with a USB-C port and 3.5mm jack, Headphone 1 goes old-school with hardware controls and ports, and I love it.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-nothing-headphone-1-what-s-not-good"><span>Nothing Headphone 1: What's not good</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Tb4miSRtuJJFcPhKBiHXc" name="Nothing-Headphone-1-10" alt="The ear cushions on the Nothing Headphone 1." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Tb4miSRtuJJFcPhKBiHXc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Reviews</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/nothing-ear-2-review"><strong>Nothing Ear 2 </strong></a></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/nothing-ear-open-review"><strong>Nothing Ear Open</strong></a></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/nothing-ear-review"><strong>Nothing Ear</strong></a></p></div></div><p>Nothing got a lot right with the Headphone 1, but I would've liked to see the pair handle a wider variety of songs more consistently. As I alluded to earlier, Headphone 1's sound tuning doesn't favor every kind of track. When you run into that one song that doesn't sound quite right, it might bug you. By comparison, something like the Sonos Ace can handle more songs without you needing to break into the Nothing X app equalizer.</p><p>Another part of the Headphone 1 experience that is <em>mostly</em> good are the buttons. It's great that they are here, but the paddle in particular could be easier to use. By default, the paddle can be flicked left or right to restart a song or change tracks. You're supposed to double-flick the paddle to go to the previous song, but need to take an awkward pause to do it. If you try to flick the paddle too quickly, it simply won't do anything.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2F6PhNmyX2TfUKi8zm9mj" name="Nothing-Headphone-1-9" alt="A side view of the Nothing Headphone 1 hanging from a chair." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2F6PhNmyX2TfUKi8zm9mj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Finally, the Headphone 1's battery life is excellent, lasting up to 35 hours with ANC on and up to 80 with it off. I just wish the 3.5mm jack would work as a fallback when the battery runs out, which it doesn't. You still need the battery to have juice in order to use the analog ports, and to me that slightly limits their utility.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-nothing-headphone-1-competition"><span>Nothing Headphone 1: Competition</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kNwtqaodMDoB4siVuiU5u" name="Nothing-Headphone-1-2" alt="The Nothing Headphone 1." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kNwtqaodMDoB4siVuiU5u.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Nothing Headphone 1 case bears a striking resemblance to that of the Sonos Ace. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's important to remember that many of the over-ear headphones I'd take over the Nothing Headphone 1 cost much more.

But an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.syss.com/posts/bluetooth-analysis-coros-pace-3/">IT exposé from SySS GmbH</a> has revealed a major security vulnerability, and COROS has been slow to acknowledge and address it.</p><p>According to the report, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-pace-3-review">COROS PACE 3</a> does not properly authenticate or encrypt the Bluetooth connection between your watch and phone, bypassing the "Secure Connections" tool introduced in Bluetooth 4.2 for a simpler connection.</p><p>A hijacker can exploit this vulnerability and force-pair to your watch if it becomes disconnected from your phone at any time, letting them perform these actions:</p><ul><li>"Hijacking the vicitim’s COROS account and accessing all data</li><li>Eavesdropping sensitive data, e.g. notifications</li><li>Manipulating the device configuration</li><li>Factory resetting the device</li><li>Crashing the device</li><li>Interrupting a running activity and forcing the recorded data to be lost"</li></ul><p>Your COROS account could show info like where you typically start your runs, as well as login details. But the notification access seems particularly frightening, as they can "eavesdrop" on <strong>every</strong> notification your connected phone receives. They can even "inject" fake notifications onto your watch using a Python script.</p><p>The attacker could also go to a race event and factory-reset every COROS watch in the area remotely, without the victims being able to determine who is doing it.</p><p>Interestingly, the SySS GmbH report notes that hijackers' access is easier with connected Android phones. iOS encrypts the Bluetooth connection at the system level, but with Android, the watch skips the "AuthReq" step and simply pairs, so the connection is "neither encrypted nor authenticated" by default.</p><p>All a hijacker needs to do is "wait for an Android phone with the COROS app installed to come into Bluetooth range." After that, "any ongoing BLE connection between an Android phone and the watch can be intercepted, sniffed, or tampered with, making attacks far more practical and harder to detect."</p><p><strong>Update: </strong>A COROS rep shared the company's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.coros.com/hc/en-us/articles/38933102526996-Bluetooth-Security-Vulnerability-Statement">Bluetooth Security Vulnerability Statement</a>, which clarifies that this hacking attempt will need to be within "30 feet" and that Android users should force-quit the COROS app when not in use, which "prevents notifications from being passed to the watch in rare attack scenarios."

The tipster alleges that the tablet is currently in testing with software build number X406BXXU0AYF9, which the publication adds is a version of One UI 7 (Android 15). This software testing was reportedly spotted on Samsung's servers.</p><p>The tipster adds that the Galaxy S10 Lite "is probably planned" for a launch alongside Samsung's upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/galaxy-tab-s11-ultra-battery-specifications-leak">Galaxy Tab S11 series</a>.</p><p>Another discovery doubles down on a previous rumor, that the Tab S10 Lite could debut featuring the old Exynos 1380 SoC. While the comments <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Nyx_lost1/status/1939985475248312695">expressed their displeasure</a> with this potential, the publication reiterates a Geekbench listing for the tablet. According to the post, the Tab S10 Lite supposedly ran through its benchmark test, which delivered a 782 score for its single-core test and a 2,637 score for its multi-core portion.</p><h2 id="affordable-points-toward-mid-range-2">Affordable points toward mid-range</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Galaxy Tab S10 Lite Software tests have started ‼️Exynos 1380 chipset set to be used Build test: X406BXXU0AYF9/X406BOXM0AYF9/X406BXXU0AYF9The tablet is probably planned to be introduced with the Tab S11 series#samsung #tabS10lite pic.twitter.com/kXHYkuL37T<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1939985031759274110">July 1, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>We last heard rumors about an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/samsung-galaxy-tab-s11-s10-lite-device-rumors">alleged Galaxy Tab S10 Lite in April</a>, shortly after the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-fe-and-s10-fe-plus-launched">Tab S10 FE launched</a>. While Samsung's FE branding typically indicates a lower price point than its flagship models, tacking on "Lite" should (ideally) bring that down even further. Those early rumors were light, only digging up its supposed name and use of cellular and Wi-Fi connectivity (each its own variant) for the market.</p><p>However, it was also speculated that the chip could use Samsung's two-year-old <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-exynos-1380-launch">Exynos 1380 chipset</a>, which we've seen again today. This chip was designed with midrange devices in mind. In 2023, the chip debuted with the Arm Mali G68 GPU and an octa-core CPU featuring four Arm Cortex A78s and four Cortex A55s. There's increased speculation that the chip could support a 144Hz refresh rate, as well.</p><p>Other specs, like its display size, are still a wonder; however, the Tab S10 FE featured a 10.9-inch screen, so perhaps the Lite will arrive around there (or smaller). Additionally, Samsung priced the Tab S10 FE and S10 Plus FE at $499 and $649, respectively.</p><p>If the Tab S10 Lite drops with the Tab S11 series, we might <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/galaxy-tab-s11-ultra-surfaces-stronger-mediatek-database-leaks">have to wait until the fall</a> to see them.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p><ul><li><strong>Tablet deals: </strong><a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/1943169/614286/10014?subId1=ac-us-1182909916679810686&sharedId=ac-us&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fipad-tablets-ereaders%2Ftablets%2Fpcmcat209000050008.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat209000050008" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1943169/565706/9383?subId1=ac-us-2966126632566758786&sharedId=ac-us&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dtablet" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://shop-links.co/link?publisher_slug=future&exclusive=1&u1=ac-us-1825920675507257921&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fshop%2Fall-deals%2Ftablets-laptops-computers-deals%2F&article_name=Galaxy%20Tab%20S11%20Ultra%20surfaces%20in%20new%20leak%20with%20a%20boosted%20flagship%20MediaTek%20chip&article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.androidcentral.com%2Ftablets%2Fsamsung-galaxy-tab%2Fgalaxy-tab-s11-ultra-surfaces-stronger-mediatek-database-leaks" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dtablet%26crid%3D2HCFROTF588S1%26sprefix%3Dtablet%252Caps%252C159%26ref%3Dnb_sb_noss_1%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1086904816089408270-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100048248-17070419?sid=ac-us-5673602041223193278&url=https://www.dell.com/en-us/search/tablet" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Dell</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

There&apos;s the "Big Deal Days" sale event in October, and Amazon has also begun holding a "Big Spring Sale" every March. Then there are typically sales around significant US holidays, such as Memorial Day and Presidents&apos; Day. </p><p>That being said, there&apos;s only one <em>true</em> Prime Day, and its offers generally beat every other sale event except Black Friday/Cyber Monday. In other words, if you want to find a great deal at Amazon, Prime Day is the best time to do it (unless you want to wait until November). </p><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide"><em><strong>For more on Prime Day 2025, head to our ultimate shopping guide</strong></em></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Luna claims the glasses might feature a game called "Hypertrail," which seems to be inspired by the retro game Galaga, and may even "involve the user's location in some way."</p><p>Meta's next-gen Ray-Ban glasses have garnered some hype, especially since this device is expected to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-2026-smart-glasses-live-ai-facial-software-report">have a display built in</a>. The Hypernova (3rd gen Ray-Ban) is said to have a singular screen implanted in the right lens at the bottom. Moreover, the report from April stated the glasses could feature a full set of Android-powered computational software. As such, the Hypernova could receive a stacked array of apps already on deck; however, it might lack a full-fledged app store.</p><p>While the Hypernova probably won't replace your phone, it'll likely serve as an input alternative that still relies on that connection.</p><p>Reports add that Meta is likely working on some camera improvements for these glasses, too. Meta is expected to release these Hypernova glasses sometime in 2025, but there are already rumors of a Hypernova 2 that might sport two displays, one in each lens.</p><p>The sEMG bracelet we've seen leaked today (July 1) is something Android Central's Nicholas Sutrich <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-semg-wristband-whitepaper">playtested earlier this year</a>. The bracelet is designed to take XR (augmented reality) to new heights, giving users a more intuitive method for digital input. The sEMG is said to be "more private" than voice input when in public places, and it keeps you a little more aware, as you're not preoccupied with a handheld screen.</p><p>The bracelet also seems quite necessary for Meta's smart glasses future as, according to Sutrich, "Using a pair of smart glasses without this band is akin to using a smartphone without a touch screen."</p> ]]></dc:content>

A recent discovery, made through an NBTC (National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission) listing, reportedly revealed the Flip 7 FE's certification details. The listing showcased the phone's two model numbers: SM-F761B and SM-F761U, which are speculated to be Samsung's planned regions for marketing.</p><p>Aside from the NBTC (Thailand) certification, the device has also seemingly rolled through the FCC and BIS.</p><p>Now, with Spigen's early case collection slip-up, perhaps that's all we need to "confirm" the Flip 7 FE is real.

The back isn't just unique and interesting looking, though, it does away with Nothing's trademark Glyph Interface and replaces it with something else: a micro-LED screen called the Glyph Matrix.</p><p>As the name would imply, this is an intentionally low-resolution display designed to look retro chic, similar to how the company has been using dot matrix style fonts and UI elements on its phones for years. But Glyph Matrix isn't just a cute little screen or a smaller replacement for the Glyph Interface LEDs on prior Nothing phones, it provides a whole new set of functions that build on Nothing's most unique feature.</p><p>A click of the button on the back will cycle between a battery indicator, stopwatch, mirror, digital clock, solar clock, and even a handful of bespoke games Nothing calls Glyph Toys. It also emulates Glyph Interface functions, such as per-contact notifications and progress indicators. Nothing also published a Glyph Matrix SDK for the Nothing Community to build new games, so expect lots of grassroots support for this feature.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2YEAJkDKT38T8rqmJ9Yxx" name="nothing-phone-3-official-black-and-white" alt="Official imagery of the Nothing Phone 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2YEAJkDKT38T8rqmJ9Yxx.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nothing)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On the back is a trio of new cameras that fixes one of the few things we didn't like about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Nothing Phone 2</a>, including a new 1/1.3” 50MP main sensor with OIS, a 50MP ultrawide sensor, a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-shows-off-phone-3s-periscope-lens-in-its-latest-tease">50MP periscope camera</a> with OIS and 3x optical zoom, and a 114-degree FoV 50MP front-facing camera.

I have the butteriest butter fingers ever, meaning I drop things all the time, and the simple addition of a magnetic phone grip rewrote the script for me, literally helping me <strong>get a grip</strong>. My current favorite phone grip that's highly durable is the metallic one from UAG because it's extra sturdy. In fact, I ranked it among <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/my-favorite-magsafe-phone-grips-ranked">my top three phone grips</a> of all time.</p><p>Nothing beats the comfort of a PopSocket, but those things are quite flimsy in comparison to what UAG has to offer. My beloved PopSocket broke a little over a year into use, but the UAG is still going strong a year later. Since the brand focuses on the rugged smartphone accessory niche, the people behind the UAG Magnetic Ring Stand know what they're doing.</p><p>If you only buy one phone grip, this should be it. It can be used in so many different configurations, despite being a tough metallic construct.</p><p>My one gripe with this magnetic grip was that it's pretty expensive, but now that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/amazon-prime-day">Amazon Prime Day</a>'s coming up, you should keep your eyes peeled for a deal on this grip. We've seen it go on sale before, so I'm certain you can nab one for a solid discount.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="f44fa6c6-cd27-4472-b61d-0b3a187999dc" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="The UAG Magnetic Ring Stand can be used in multiple configurations, whether as a regular ring-shaped phone grip or as a phone stand in either landscape or portrait orientation.

You won't find a more durable phone grip than this. It's also quite grippy thanks to the top coat, which adds an ever-so-slight grainy matte texture. I can't name a single time when I accidentally dropped my phone while using this grip.</p><p>There are multiple ways to use the Magnetic Ring Stand from UAG. The creative design allows for a full 360-degree rotation. It also enables you to bend and contort the hexagonal stand in so many different configurations, propping up your phone at various angles and orientations.</p><p>The UAG Magnetic Ring Stand comes with a magnetic adapter ring for non-MagSafe or non-Qi2 phones, so you don't have to worry about incompatibility either. And since you get a magnetic ring, you can take the Magnetic Ring Stand off to charge your phone wirelessly or mount it on something like a car phone holder.</p><p>The UAG Magnetic Ring Stand comes in seven colors, and while this isn't anywhere near as diverse as PopSockets, it's still a pleasant collection of crowd-pleasing shades. From blues and greens to bright pink and silver hues, it's a fun selection of colors.</p><p>I'm still waiting on my UAG grip to break, but it's going strong. Based on my user experience so far, I feel confident that it's going to last me a long time. If it's the only grip you buy, this is the one to get.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>MVNO deals: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/"><u><strong>Mint Mobile</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.visible.com/plans/"><u><strong>Visible</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://deals.boostmobile.com/mypromo/trial-mybm"><u><strong>Boost</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://tello.com/buy/custom_plans"><u><strong>Tello</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.cricketwireless.com/cell-phone-plans"><u><strong>Cricket</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>Carrier deals: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers"><u><strong>T-Mobile</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><u><strong>Mint Mobile</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.visible.com/deals/"><u><strong>Visible</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Going as far back as the obscure Sony e-reader, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-e-ink-tablet">E Ink tablets</a> have always been my jam. These days, though, Kindle is the go-to brand for most folks. And with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-2025-early-deals-and-faq">Amazon Prime Day 2025</a> on the horizon, you're probably looking to buy one. I'm here to tell you not to do so.</p><p>Once upon a time, Amazon's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-amazon-kindle">Kindle lineup</a> was top-notch. Everyone used to rave about the battery life and durability, and these facts still stand true about the current lineup. However, I find them too limiting considering what's available on the market now. E-paper tablets have good battery life by default thanks to the display technology, so it's not a unique selling point anymore.</p><p>Gone are the days when a Kindle was the coolest kid on the block. Its crown has been knocked over by impressive contenders like Onyx Boox, Bigme, and PocketBook. From e-paper tablets running Android or Linux and colored displays to robust stylus support and wide file format compatibility, the competition is stiff.</p><p>To be frank, Amazon is trying to compete solely on the basis of an undercutting price at this point. However, I argue that price alone is no longer enough.</p><h2 id="onyx-boox-caters-to-your-every-reading-related-need-2">Onyx Boox caters to your every reading-related need</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SdehZGECnKkPFCBK5RFu4D" name="Onyx Boox Go 7 vs Amazon Kindle" alt="Onyx Boox Go 7 vs Amazon Kindle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SdehZGECnKkPFCBK5RFu4D.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="masZfFLzn6nxGq6ruCmG2D" name="Onyx Boox Go 7 vs Amazon Kindle" alt="Onyx Boox Go 7 vs Amazon Kindle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/masZfFLzn6nxGq6ruCmG2D.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3701px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="mAXMHmdbGT4on8M6rZhUpC" name="Onyx Boox Go 7 vs Amazon Kindle" alt="Onyx Boox Go 7 vs Amazon Kindle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mAXMHmdbGT4on8M6rZhUpC.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3701" height="2082" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Why should you waste $100 or so on a restricted Amazon Kindle with very limited functionality, when you can add a bit more money and get something much more versatile and powerful?</p><p>For $150, the Onyx Boox Go 6 destroys the basic $110 Kindle, both of which have a 6-inch 300ppi display. The Go 6 comes with Android 11, 2GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-micro-sd-card-android">microSD slot</a>, and USB OTG support. You can install any app under the sun on it, including your own reading app.</p><p>In pale comparison, the base model 6-inch Kindle only has 16GB onboard storage and an extremely constricted OS with no third-party app support. The limited file compatibility means you can't use popular formats like CBR and CBZ for your comics or graphic novels, and there's no memory card slot. If you want more storage or the ad-free variant, you need to shell out more dough.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3837px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="uMJkrdhrkcWDAAqaoZ24aK" name="Onyx Boox Go 7" alt="Onyx Boox Go 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uMJkrdhrkcWDAAqaoZ24aK.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3837" height="2159" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="K7hcQkJX7t7P8KJPPLkX3L" name="Onyx Boox Go 7" alt="Onyx Boox Go 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/K7hcQkJX7t7P8KJPPLkX3L.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2t3VhGPmdHeyL8sdGyAVoK" name="Onyx Boox Go 7" alt="Onyx Boox Go 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2t3VhGPmdHeyL8sdGyAVoK.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>If you throw in a bit more, you can even score stylus support. The latest Onyx Boox Go 7 goes up against the $160 Kindle Paperwhite, featuring a 7-inch 300ppi E Ink display and 16GB storage. The Go 7 costs $250, but that price hike pays for itself in terms of the upgrades it gets you.</p><p>Like any Boox tablet, the Go 7 runs unrestricted Android 13, so you can install all your favorite reading and library apps.

It supports stylus input, comes with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity, has a built-in speaker, and is impossibly thin and lightweight.</p><p>Yes, you can read e-books and listen to audiobooks via Bluetooth on the 7- or 6-inch Kindle as well, but neither one has a speaker.

It starkly highlights the handicaps of the Kindle OS and the lack of access and features on Kindle e-readers.</p><p>An Android-based E Ink tablet is so much easier to navigate out of the box, even if it is your first e-reader ever. I can't say the same for a Kindle. The Kindle OS feels slower, a little more janky, and less user-friendly.</p><p>Something as simple as sending e-books to a Kindle can be challenging. If you use the email method, the first one always ends up in spam. You need to go to the Amazon website on your computer to greenlight it.</p><p>Onyx Boox makes the process as simple as possible. You can generate a QR code that can be scanned by another device to directly send files. Alternatively, installing a web browser or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cloud-storage-service">cloud storage app</a> enables you to directly download your files from the internet onto your e-reader. I like to store all my files on Google Drive or Microsoft OneDrive and download them onto my Boox directly.</p><h2 id="a-better-e-reader-delivers-a-superior-reading-experience-2">A better e-reader delivers a superior reading experience</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="D6pHmfAEagxsWBXHqkiJfK" name="Onyx Boox Go 7" alt="Onyx Boox Go 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/D6pHmfAEagxsWBXHqkiJfK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>To sum up, an Onyx Boox tablet has an open-ended OS with unlimited potential. You don't have to pause and think about small actions, like whether you can send a certain file to your e-reader or worry about compatibility issues.</p><p>Since the Kindle OS is intentionally limited to the Kindle Store and a web browser, it's harder to use other reading platforms such as Libby, Wattpad, Crunchyroll, and WEBTOON. You're also denied the opportunity to seamlessly view and edit documents on a beautiful e-paper screen using apps like Google Docs, Microsoft 365, Adobe, or Canva.</p><p>With Amazon's crisp display quality and robust battery life, the basic formula started out right. But with everything else in perspective, it's a world of missed opportunities.</p><p>Anything and everything related to reading or writing is easier, more versatile, more interactive, and so much better overall on an Onyx Boox tablet. Regardless of the model, these E Ink tablets don't disappoint. So why should you settle for a cheap Kindle?</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="a518bb6a-3bb5-467c-b1fd-8d6e1419c313">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/z9dqyqFEEphU7SvsE22sDd.jpg' alt="Onyx Boox Go 7"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Onyx Boox Go 7</div>                                <div class="stars__reviews"><span itemprop="reviewRating" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Rating" class="chunk rating"><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><meta itemprop="bestRating" content="100.0" /><meta itemprop="worstRating" content="0.0" /><meta itemprop="ratingValue" content="80" /></span></div>                </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Light delight</strong></em></p><p>The Onyx Boox Go 7 is one of the cheapest e-readers offered by the brand, but it doesn't cheap out in any way.

Design-wise, the Middleton II looks quite similar to the company's original Middleton and even the Emberton series. Marshall touts its latest speaker as a compact device that's small enough to be "thrown into a bag whenever the moment calls for it." With dimensions like 9.05x3.86x4.33 inches, the Middleton II is a small (yet loud) travel buddy.</p><p>Moreover, Marshall highlights the speaker's expected outdoor use. The speaker has been granted an IP67 rating for dust and water resistance.</p><p>One key update with the Middleton II is its ease of use. Marshall says the speaker's controls have been reworked to be much simpler. The device now features a multidirectional control knob for "instant" music access and the ability to "twist or press" the knob to play, pause, and skip tunes, as well as volume adjustment and call answering.</p><p>When it comes to sound, Marshall states the Middleton II takes its sound a step further when used on the highest setting. Cranking the speaker up to max now should award consumers with "deeper bass and more refined performance." Additionally, the press release draws attention to the speaker's 360-degree True Stereophonic Sound.</p><p>Marshall remains confident that the Middleton II can "fill a room" with your favorite tunes.</p><h2 id="more-than-just-a-speaker-2">More than just a speaker</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:499px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:120.24%;"><img id="LyHsnKwpB37KXduGsKcfXh" name="marshall-middleton-II-cream-color" alt="The Marshall Middleton II portable speaker in a model's hand by its strap in a cream color." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LyHsnKwpB37KXduGsKcfXh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="499" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Marshall)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Marshall Middleton II is ready for whatever road trip or family outing you've got planned with over 30 hours of battery life. Marshall's Ebba Gouverneur Regnström, product manager, states, "extending portable playtime is something we put a lot of work into at Marshall, and Middleton II is no exception with its 30-plus hours."</p><p>Regnström adds, "With support for LE Audio, listeners can also enjoy a more efficient and enhanced listening experience."</p><p>With such a large battery, Marshall highlights users' ability to get enough juice to get going again in just 20 minutes on the charger. More importantly, the post states the Middleton II can double as a power bank. Essentially, the speaker has your phone's back whenever things get tough—power-wise and for phone calls. The speaker also features a built-in microphone, and its Bluetooth connectivity lets users utilize it to its fullest extent.</p><p>Users can answer phone calls completely hands-free with the Middleton II.</p><p>Following today's press release, Marshall states the Middleton II launches "globally" today (July 1) for $329. This launch is restricted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.marshall.com/us/en">to its official page</a> for the time being.

In fact, I am confident that there isn't a better value deal in existence at the moment. This is coming from a long-term OnePlus fan who had given up on the brand completely, so you can trust my word.</p><p>Currently, the OnePlus 13R costs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DP96J3KT/"><strong>$549.99 at Amazon</strong></a> for the standard 12GB/256GB version. The retail price is usually $599.99, so you save $50. However, I highly urge you to wait for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/amazon-prime-day">Amazon Prime Day</a> to score a sweeter discount on the phone. Based on past sales, there's a high likelihood of OnePlus treating us to a deliciously enticing deal.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="f44fa6c6-cd27-4472-b61d-0b3a187999dc" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$599.99" data-dimension48="$599.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DP96J3KT/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="V24Sd4Fy7iR5gE2SmVAhCe" name="oneplus 13r reco 500x500" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V24Sd4Fy7iR5gE2SmVAhCe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>OnePlus 13R:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DP96J3KT/" data-dimension112="f44fa6c6-cd27-4472-b61d-0b3a187999dc" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$599.99" data-dimension48="$599.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$599.99</del><strong> $549.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>Not big on spending close to a thousand dollars on a solid Android phone? Forget about the Google Pixels and Samsung Galaxies of the world. The OnePlus 13R is an all-rounder with powerful performance you can rely on. It sports a stunningly lightweight design with IP65 dust and water resistance, an insane 6,000mAh battery that lasts two days with heavy use, and a stunningly crisp 120Hz AMOLED display with HDR10+ and 4,500 nits of peak brightness. The price is already fantastic on this phone but if you're patient, you can catch an even better deal on this phone once Amazon Prime Day rolls around in just a few days' time.</p><p><strong>Price comparison:</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/oneplus-13r-256gb-unlocked-nebula-noir/6609358.p"><strong>$599.99 at Best Buy</strong></a> | <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/OnePlus-13R-Global-Version-Smartphone-Snapdragon-8-Gen-3-120Hz-Display-6000mAh-Battery-55W-SUPERVOOC-12GB-256GB-Black/15656004325"><strong>$599 at Walmart</strong></a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DP96J3KT/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="f44fa6c6-cd27-4472-b61d-0b3a187999dc" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$599.99" data-dimension48="$599.99" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong> you need robust performance from your phone and a long-lasting battery life that recharges quickly. Value-for-money is the key driver here.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you want fabulous photography, since the 13R doesn't have the best cameras for a mid-range phone.</p><h2 id="more-for-less-2">More for less</h2><p>Samsung and Google used to dominate the top tier of the Android space, but OnePlus has made an admirable comeback in the last few years. The brand that touted the indomitable "never settle" spirit had lost its spark after the OPPO merger, but things are better than ever before now.</p><p>I switched to Google Pixel and Samsung Galaxy devices after OnePlus lost its charm. But after I got my hands on the nifty <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a>, my entire perspective on the brand shifted. What's impressive is that the newer iteration, the 13R, is an even better phone, and it still costs so less! Compared to any other mid-ranger, the $550 price tag for 12GB/256GB memory and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor</a> is unthinkable!</p><p>For reference, the 8GB/256GB <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">Pixel 9a</a> variant costs $599, whereas the 8GB/256GB <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-hands-on">Galaxy S24 FE</a> is priced at $585. Performance-wise, both the Pixel's Tensor G4 and the Galaxy's Exynos 2400e are miles behind the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset powering the OnePlus 13R.</p><h2 id="what-i-love-about-the-oneplus-13r-2">What I love about the OnePlus 13R</h2><p>The OnePlus 13R retains everything I love about the 12R, including a generous battery and blazing quick charging. There's an extra 500mAh on the 13R, meaning the 6,000mAh cell lasts two days on average. And when that runs out, the included 80W charger recharges the device at lightning-fast speed. There's no wireless charging, but the lack of it isn't felt at all thanks to the amazing battery and charging specs.</p><p>On the performance side, there's no need for me to tell you just how capable the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 SoC is. It boasts a 30% increase in performance over the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, and 20% better efficiency with the same workloads. Flagships like last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> are powered by it, so having this kind of power on such an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">affordable budget phone</a> is nothing short of a miracle.</p><p>The only aspect of the 13R that doesn't feel as premium is the camera lineup. Although the main camera has been bumped up and there is now a telephoto lens included as well, the auxiliary lenses aren't as capable as the primary lens. This is the one area where the Pixel 9a ekes out a victory over the 13R. That's not to say the picture quality is bad; it just pales in comparison to alternatives like the 9a.</p><p>All in all, I don't think this should be a deal breaker for anyone. With a mid-range budget, it's hard to tick all the boxes. You need to shell out around $700 to $800 at least in that case. If you keep your photography expectations within reason, the OnePlus 13R won't disappoint you. It is the smartest purchase you will make.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>MVNO deals: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/"><u><strong>Mint Mobile</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.visible.com/plans/"><u><strong>Visible</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://deals.boostmobile.com/mypromo/trial-mybm"><u><strong>Boost</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://tello.com/buy/custom_plans"><u><strong>Tello</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.cricketwireless.com/cell-phone-plans"><u><strong>Cricket</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>Carrier deals: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers"><u><strong>T-Mobile</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><u><strong>Mint Mobile</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.visible.com/deals/"><u><strong>Visible</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Bose discontinued its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/headphones/bose-sleepbuds-ii-review">Sleepbuds</a> without a replacement, and Philips did the same. That leaves only a handful of reputable brands making high-quality sleep earbuds in 2025.</p><p>One of those brands is Soundcore, a subdivision of Anker, whose Sleep A10 and Sleep A20 are <em>both</em> on our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/best-sleep-headphones">best sleep earbuds list</a>. Now, the company is taking pre-orders on Kickstarter for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.soundcore.com/sleep-a30-smart-anc-earbuds-for-sleeping" target="_blank">next-generation Sleep A30</a>. For the first time, the Soundcore Sleep A30 feature active noise-canceling, but also come along with a $50 price hike compared to the prior model.</p><p>I've been testing (and sleeping with) the Soundcore Sleep A30 for a week, and they knock it out of the park. As a side sleeper, I was impressed with how the Sleep A30 earbuds managed to comfortably stay in my ears most nights with zero pressure or discomfort the morning after. The sound quality and active noise-canceling are great considering the earbuds' size, too.</p><p>However, a steep retail price of $230 means that interested buyers should consider whether the Sleep A30 can double as everyday or workout earbuds to make the investment worthwhile.</p><h2 id="comfort-is-top-notch-with-the-soundcore-sleep-a30-2">Comfort is top-notch with the Soundcore Sleep A30</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VFqoLXFFpCjdYAnHpqCd87" name="Anker-Soundcore-Sleep-A30-9" alt="The Anker Soundcore Sleep A30 earbuds." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VFqoLXFFpCjdYAnHpqCd87.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Above all else, comfort is the most important aspect of sleep earbuds. They need to be designed to be compatible with a variety of sleeping positions and preferences, and they're especially tricky for side sleepers like me. Sleep earbuds that are too bulky and protrude from your ear canal too much will cause discomfort as soon as your head hits the pillow.</p><p>Soundcore's Sleep A10 and A20 were already outstanding in this regard, as they kept an ultra-low profile. That gets better with the Sleep A30, as these earbuds are 7% smaller than the older models. This was immediately noticeable because after twisting the buds into my ears, they sit nearly flush. While lying on my side, I quickly forgot the earbuds were in my ears at all.</p><p>Something that shocked me while testing the Soundcore Sleep A30 was how well they fit securely in my ears without creating pressure or congestion. Usually, when I wear earbuds to sleep, they either fall out during the night or cause a ton of congestion after waking up. Neither happened while testing the Sleep A30 — I never felt discomfort, and the earbuds only fell out on one occasion.</p><p>Some of this can be attributed to the Sleep A30's small form factor, and the rest results from excellent ventilation.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Ek2bCEYwGta8yAJTKCLpU7" name="Anker-Soundcore-Sleep-A30-3" alt="The wingtip sizes and instructions that come with the Soundcore Sleep A30." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ek2bCEYwGta8yAJTKCLpU7.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rwNfGbXtcgAJQvTCQyjeA7" name="Anker-Soundcore-Sleep-A30-2" alt="The silicone and memory foam eartips that come with the Anker Soundcore Sleep A30 earbuds." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rwNfGbXtcgAJQvTCQyjeA7.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>I used the medium silicone eartip on the left earbud and the small silicone eartip on the right, but there are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-get-best-fit-your-true-wireless-earbuds">plenty of customizable tips included</a> in the box. You get four sizes of silicone eartips and three sizes of foam eartips, plus three sets of wings. Between the flexible wings that help lock the earbuds in place and the variety of tip sizes and materials, just about everyone should find a Sleep A30 combination that works for them.</p><p>Soundcore explains that the silicone eartips will probably be more comfortable, while the foam eartips have better sound isolation and a firmer fit. If you can deal with the slight hassle, I'd consider wearing the silicone ones to sleep and workout, with the foam ones being best for daily wear.</p><h2 id="sound-quality-and-anc-are-better-than-you-d-probably-expect-2">Sound quality and ANC are better than you'd probably expect</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NQdgAtaPekcccXfoATp8h7" name="Anker-Soundcore-Sleep-A30-8" alt="The Anker Soundcore Sleep A30 earbuds." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NQdgAtaPekcccXfoATp8h7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Obviously, sound quality isn't the main goal for sleep earbuds.

There wasn't an overemphasis on any part of the soundstage — you can make out the lows, mids, and highs.</p><p>You do get booming bass with the right song, simply because the passive sound isolation is so good that the vibrations stay mostly trapped within your ear canal. There is a sense of warmth in the Sleep A30's sound signature, but I didn't mind it, especially considering their intended purpose. The volume is also excellent, allowing you to sleep at 50% or below comfortably, which is great for battery life.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7SGqeTuArWSmtKm2qnWno7" name="Anker-Soundcore-Sleep-A30-7" alt="The Anker Soundcore Sleep A30 earbuds." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7SGqeTuArWSmtKm2qnWno7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Over Bluetooth, you get 6.5 hours of playback with ANC on for each earbud, and a total of 35 hours with the charging case, according to Soundcore. This was about what I experienced during firsthand testing. After a full night of Bluetooth listening, my Sleep A30 earbuds were dead or almost dead when I woke up. In local mode, while listening to white noise or nature sounds downloaded to the earbuds themselves, that bumps to nine hours of battery life per earbud.</p><p>This is all with active noise-canceling enabled, so you can presumably squeeze out some extra battery life by flipping that toggle off.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MXL4vLzSCyfYiEFSygGFic" name="Anker-Soundcore-Sleep-A30-App" alt="The Soundcore app showing the Sleep A30 settings and screenshots." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MXL4vLzSCyfYiEFSygGFic.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/anker-soundcore-liberty-5-review">The app is solid</a>, with controls for ANC, sleep sounds, alarms, AI features, and more. However, you'll probably use it more than you'd like. The on-earbuds controls leave a bit to be desired. A double-tap of the right earbud is supposed to toggle ANC on or off, but these taps can be unreliable. You might find yourself tapping a bunch before the earbuds will recognize it, or just give up and use the app instead.</p><p>The sleep alarms were particularly helpful, as they wake you up more gently than a traditional alarm. Still, they are contingent on your earbuds lasting the entire night on a single charge, so I didn't feel comfortable using the Sleep A30 as my only alarm.</p><p>Active noise-canceling worked as expected, blocking out most sounds without causing discomfort. That said, the Sleep A30 are so good at passive sound isolation that I found I didn't need ANC on most nights, especially while playing music or sounds. This feature could be handy for someone with a specific need to block out sound, like a person living in a noisy shared space.</p><h2 id="should-you-buy-the-soundcore-sleep-a30-2">Should you buy the Soundcore Sleep A30?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FUde53R5WDY5wD6FvppnZ7" name="Anker-Soundcore-Sleep-A30-1" alt="The Anker Soundcore Sleep A30 earbuds." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FUde53R5WDY5wD6FvppnZ7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Soundcore Sleep A30 are really good, but if you already own a pair of Sleep A10 or Sleep A20, you might not need to upgrade. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-active-noise-cancellation-and-how-does-it-work-headphones">Active noise-canceling</a> is the key differentiator here, and people who don't need ANC might prefer to save a few bucks by going with the cheaper Sleep A10 or A20 instead.</p><p>Keeping that in mind, you can make the Sleep A30 a great value despite its $230 retail price if you commit to using them for multiple purposes.

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/thieaudio-oracle-mkii-review">Oracle MKII</a> showcased what it can deliver in the mid-range, and it built on that with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/thieaudio-prestige-ltd-review">Prestige LTD</a>, a high-end offering with a unique tuning.</p><p>But it's the Monarch series that defines the brand; the Monarch MKIII was introduced at the end of 2023, and it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.linsoul.com/products/thieaudio-monarch-mkiii">retails for $999 on Linsoul Audio</a>. Like the Fiio FX15, the Monarch MKIII uses a tribrid configuration of drivers that includes dual dynamic drivers, six Knowles balanced armature drivers, and two Sonion EST drivers within each shell. Combine that with Thieaudio's sound signature, and the Monarch MKIII continue to be a phenomenal choice in 2025.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="CSGjg3Dpknxbg8gEu6UsZK" name="Thieaudio Monarch MKIII" alt="Thieaudio Monarch MKIII review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CSGjg3Dpknxbg8gEu6UsZK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's clear that Thieaudio wanted to differentiate just about every facet of the Monarch MKIII, starting with the design.

That was true of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/edifier-r1280dbs-review">R1280DBs bookshelf speakers</a> or the RGB-enabled see-through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/edifier-qd35-review">QD35 </a>that came with a built-in GaN charger. Edifier clearly likes the idea of integrating GaN charging into its products, because the QR65 also has the feature.</p><p>The QR65 is an active desktop monitor; just hook it up to power and add a source device, and you can start listening to music — no need to use an amp. I got the white color option, and it looks elegant thanks to the faux leather construction. Coming in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Edifier-Speakers-Function-Bluetooth-Subwoofer/dp/B0CSYLQTPD">at $499 on Amazon</a>, the QR65 isn't affordable by any measure, but it has a few key advantages.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="gCqEoY9xcy4evHHfedYvTg" name="Edifier QR65" alt="Edifier QR65 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gCqEoY9xcy4evHHfedYvTg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's obviously the design; the QR65 looks distinctive thanks to the white chassis and a baffle that has LED lighting. That in itself makes the QR65 stand out in my book, and Edifier did a fabulous job with the lighting; it uses a custom TempoAbyss tech that mirrors the lighting effects, and the overall look is stunning. There are 11 presets as standard, and you can customize the lighting via Edifier's ConneX mobile app.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="Bi5qo2QrQZDNtXGMgysGJj" name="Edifier QR65" alt="Edifier QR65 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Bi5qo2QrQZDNtXGMgysGJj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The LED lighting doesn't look tacky in the least, and if anything, it gives the QR65 a futuristic design that looks great on a desk. The design itself is clean, and other than Edifier branding, you don't get any logos on the front fascia. The brand includes stands in the package that let you angle the QR65, and this is a welcome addition.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="x2YQdmzdvr2BWBMZobmz7j" name="Edifier QR65" alt="Edifier QR65 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/x2YQdmzdvr2BWBMZobmz7j.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The metallic stands look good and complement the look of the QR65, and a minor quibble in this regard is that they have a tagline etched onto the front that says A Passion for Sound. The only other issue I have with the QR65 is that it doesn't come with a remote. I used the remote extensively to control the R1280DBs, and that would have been nice in this scenario as well.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="EdMFTGUXeGkXM6ZsUkEgLj" name="Edifier QR65" alt="Edifier QR65 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EdMFTGUXeGkXM6ZsUkEgLj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The QR65 doesn't take up that much room on a desk, and as is the case with powered monitors, you get an active speaker (the one on the right), and the left is a passive unit. The right unit has physical controls, including a multifunction button that lets you cycle through connection modes. You also get a volume knob, and an LED brightness knob that lets you adjust the intensity of the lighting or disable it entirely if that isn't to your liking.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="tWcrVQ8v4BKzpkRwUt7kCj" name="Edifier QR65" alt="Edifier QR65 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tWcrVQ8v4BKzpkRwUt7kCj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's decent connectivity at the back; you have standard RCA in as well as USB-A, and as I was connecting the QR65 to my Windows gaming rig, I used the latter. What I particularly like is that it has a subwoofer out, and this is handy — I connected the QR65 to an Edifier T5 subwoofer, and it made a huge difference.</p><p>Another differentiator is the ability to connect to your phone via Bluetooth; the QR65 has a Bluetooth 5.3 modem, and I was able to pair it with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-ultra-long-term-review">X100 Ultra</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x200-ultra-review">X200 Ultra</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/oppo-find-x8-ultra-review">Find X8 Ultra</a>, and several dozen devices in the course of the last 12 months. It even has LDAC integration, so you're able to stream music at up to 96kHz/24-bit over Bluetooth.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="guoaj4WVn2a5D8GCZLmrYj" name="Edifier QR65" alt="Edifier QR65 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/guoaj4WVn2a5D8GCZLmrYj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The biggest plus point of the QR65 is the inclusion of an integrated GaN charger. The rear of the right satellite houses two USB-C ports as well as a USB-A port, and you get 65W of charging potential over the USB PD standard. This feature is the reason why I used the QR65 on my desk for the better part of a year — it's just so much more convenient to charge devices this way.</p><p>The USB-A port goes up to 60W on its own, and the USB-C1 and C2 ports hit 65W individually. They have the standard PD power profiles: 5V/3A (15W), 9V/3a (27W), 12V/3A (36W), and 20V/3.25A (65W). You get the total 65W power budget when both USB-C ports are in use, with the power split into 20W and 45W. I had no issues charging devices with the QR65, and Edifier deserves credit for bundling this feature into its active monitors.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="YPfHnKeFpQ3stzHsHqrr2j" name="Edifier QR65" alt="Edifier QR65 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YPfHnKeFpQ3stzHsHqrr2j.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Coming to the audio, each unit of the QR65 houses a 1.25-inch tweeter with 15W power alongside a 20W 2.75-inch woofer, with the total RMS power at 70W. There isn't much in the way of sub-bass with these monitors, but that's a given considering the size of the drivers. Other than that, you get a balanced sound with clean mid-bass articulation, natural mids, and good treble.</p><p>Although the sound is quite good in its own right, you'll need to connect a subwoofer to make the most of the QR65's potential. Other than that, Edifier did everything right with the QR65; the monitors have an elegant design, good sound, and 65W GaN charging is the icing on the cake.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="af9b05d4-dbd4-47f4-94ad-d3b7a14f50b0">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XueYA98mZruqyxK7Njegse.jpg' alt="Edifier QR65 Active Monitor Speakers"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Edifier QR65</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The QR65 is a great studio monitor in its own right, and the inclusion of a 65W GaN charger gives it much greater versatility. </p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

These features don’t just block the tricks; they also alert you when something shady is going on.</p><p>With Android 16, Google is beefing up your phone’s defenses with the addition of the “Mobile network security” setting. It’ll flag sketchy stuff, like unencrypted connections or networks fishing for your device ID, both common stingray tricks. You’ll also be able to shut off 2G entirely, cutting off one of the easiest ways for snoops to get in.</p><h2 id="stingrays-aren-t-just-for-law-enforcement-2">Stingrays aren’t just for law enforcement</h2><p>While law enforcement agencies have used them for surveillance, they’re not off-limits to shady individuals either.

Google's move here is a major step toward keeping your phone conversations and data safe from these silent threats.</p><p>The newest Android update, which arrived earlier this month, brings these security upgrades. Supported devices now get a toggle for “network notifications."</p><p>Flip it on, and your phone will alert you if it connects to an unencrypted network or if that network tries to grab your device's unique identifiers. Both are red flags for shady stuff like stingray attacks.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Both Pro models could see a higher battery capacity, with the Pixel 10 Pro getting 4,870 mAh capacity, and the Pro XL could show up with a large 5,200 mAh battery, the largest yet for a Google Pixel phone.</p><p>The website further notes that the Pro and Pro XL models will achieve higher charging speeds due to their Qi2 compatibility, with 29W and 39W, respectively, in addition to 15W wireless charging speeds.</p><p>As for the phone's camera, both models are not expected to receive any major camera changes, with the same 50MP primary sensor, 48MP ultrawide lens, 48MP telephoto lens, and a 42MP selfie camera. However, despite similar lenses, the devices are expected to capture higher-quality images, as the website alleges, because the telephoto and ultrawide cameras could see higher apertures, which would allow for brighter and more detailed macro photos.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1420px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="LzxQjbFTwGSk3GxfBwxru7" name="Pixel-10-Pro-XL-5K1-1420x799" alt="The leaked render of the Pixel 10 Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LzxQjbFTwGSk3GxfBwxru7.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1420" height="799" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks / Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google might change things up with the phone's storage, the leak suggests that the Pixel 10 Pro will sport 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB storage options, while the Pixel 10 Pro XL will skip the 128GB model, and offer 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB — signaling Google's move to offer a premium experience on the XL variant.</p><p>Earlier <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10-color-palette-series-rumor">rumors</a> suggest that these phones will show up in four colorways: Obsidian, Green, Sterling (Grey), and Porcelain (White).</p><p>However, these are still leaks, and it remains unclear if these specs will show up on the actual device.

Apple say its has two billion. Are these numbers real?</strong></em></p><p>Man, what a cool question. As someone who loves Android <em>and</em> numbers/math, I love it! Thanks so much for asking.</p><p>First, the easy answer: yes, those numbers are real. Google and Apple know they can't just lie about things that are verifiable because the hit to their reputation would be rough, at least for a little while.</p><p>They don't mean what you probably think they mean, though. If you pay attention to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-io-android-3-billion-active-devices">what they are saying,</a> you'll notice they never actually say three billion people; they say devices. And the way devices are counted is a little squirrelly, too.</p><p>For the deeper answer, you have to start with what Android is. Android is a trademarked, privately built operating system owned by Google. It is built using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/aosp">Android Open Source Project</a>, the base code given away free for everyone. It's also open source, meaning that you can download the code and build it yourself.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1678px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:57.63%;"><img id="4nWrBwRHNS8YAn5VeyQRkA" name="AOSP.jpg" alt="AOSP" src="https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4nWrBwRHNS8YAn5VeyQRkA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1678" height="967" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Because of its licenses, most changes made to the original AOSP do not have to be open source or have the new code made available. Android is just that: software made using open-source code with changes done by Google, and then further changed by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/one-ui-8-beta-could-show-up-on-older-galaxy-devices-this-month">companies like Samsung</a>. To use the name Android, you must <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://stuff.mit.edu/afs/sipb/project/android/docs/distribute/googleplay/promote/brand.html" target="_blank">follow all of Google's rules</a>.</p><p>One of those rules is allowing access to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-play">Google Play Store</a>. For that, the software has to meet a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-gms-and-why-does-my-phone-need-it">bunch of other requirements</a> concerning interoperability, so an app that works for one device should work the same with another. As long as they are the same type of device, that is.</p><p>Remember, an Android device doesn't have to be a phone. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables">Wearables</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">tablets</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv-streamer-review">media streamers,</a> and more can also be powered by Android, and that means they also have access to Google's Play Store and other apps.</p><p>Finally, you have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebooks</a>. They also run Android in a way, and they are counted when it comes to the more than three billion devices tag.</p><p>How they get counted is what <em>really</em> matters.</p><h2 id="monthly-active-devices-2">Monthly active devices</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="yRz7VjmQNEZpKTLXgLv98A" name="onn-google-tv-4k-pro-review-google-play-store.jpg" alt="Onn Google TV 4K Pro using the Google Play Store" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yRz7VjmQNEZpKTLXgLv98A.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Your Android-powered devices regularly communicate with the Play Store if it's turned on and connected to the internet. Besides the analytics that Google loves to collect, they check for updates and work with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-is-google-play-protect">Google Play Protect</a> to keep bad apps away from the device.</p><p>As long as a device communicates with the Play Store at least once every 30 days, it is counted as an active device. That means it is part of that 3 billion+ statistic. An old phone you have lying around that only gets powered on occasionally will be counted as active for the month(s) it has been turned on at least once. The same goes for a TV box in a spare room you rarely use or a tablet you never pick up.</p><p>This also means that you are <strong>one</strong> user, but your devices are counted individually. I have two Android phones, one for work-related breaking of software and one for me to use. I also have an Android tablet, two <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nvidia-shield-tv-pro-still-worth-buying">Nvidia Shield Pro</a> TV boxes, three Chromebooks, and a smartwatch. I'm one user with eight devices that get counted.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="d48rhpLLvxaAKFhsSooiQc" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-downloading-update-forced.jpg" alt="Downloading an update on the Pixel Watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/d48rhpLLvxaAKFhsSooiQc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If everyone were like me, that would mean that the three billion devices are used by <em>only</em> 375 million separate people. Of course, not everyone has eight devices; some have one, and some have more than eight.</p><p>I'm not able to find any verifiable numbers concerning actual <em>users</em> and not devices. What I've seen ranges from four to seven billion people, but without the methodology showing how the numbers were reached, what they tell me is useless. And I'm not going to guess.</p><p>I can say that there aren't 3 billion+ people out there with an Android phone, though.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The lawmakers, Representative John Moolenaar and Raja Krishnamoorthi, have apparently pushed the U.S. Commerce Department to look into OnePlus after alleging the devices are collecting user information "without explicit user consent."</p><p>According to the two Representatives, this investigation would "determine" the types of information being collected by OnePlus devices, which could involve "transfers of sensitive personal information and screenshots."</p><p>These lawmakers explain that this interest in an investigation is the result of an "analysis" by a commercial company. It's been reported that the information provided "indicates" potential unwanted data collection by OnePlus devices, which is then sent to China-owned servers.</p><p>In its research, Reuters states the U.S. Commerce Department did not comment immediately about this potential probe. Android Central has reached out to OnePlus about this potential probe by the U.S. Commerce Department, but did not hear back in time for publication. We will update this article when we hear back.</p><h2 id="cause-for-concern-2">Cause for Concern?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="J9XFDtGRdSeKW2TpmE4tQm" name="oneplus-13-blue-back-05" alt="The back of the Ocean blue OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/J9XFDtGRdSeKW2TpmE4tQm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The U.S. government tangled with another recognizable Chinese brand back in 2020.

This went on during President Trump's first term, which granted the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/trump-administration-postpones-full-ban-huawei-another-45-days">a 45-day ban reprieve</a>, but this was for companies here in the States.</p><p>In a statement, the Commerce Department stated the extension on the Temporary General License was to prevent any "disruption" of network communication systems for those in rural areas. Huawei tried to combat its U.S. ban, calling it "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/huaweis-lawsuit-calling-us-ban-unconstitutional-has-been-dismissed">unconstitutional</a>;" however, it was quickly refuted by a judge who dismissed the lawsuit.</p><p>On the other hand, hearing "security concerns" reminds us of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/fcc-urges-tiktok-removed-app-stores-over-security-concerns">another ongoing situation</a> in the U.S.: TikTok. In 2022, the ByteDance-owned app was under fire for the belief that it was collecting U.S. user data, which was then being accessed in China. At the time, the U.S. Federal Communications commissioner, Brendan Carr, stated, "it harvests swaths of sensitive data that new reports show is being accessed in Beijing."</p><p>We've since gone through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/a-tiktok-ban-isnt-about-privacy-its-about-politics">a TikTok ban</a>—and its return—and we're still dealing with it today, as Trump granted the app <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/tiktok-avoids-a-us-ban-for-a-second-time-thanks-to-trumps-75-day-reprieve">a 75-day reprieve</a> back in April. While the Trump Administration has expressed its interest in keeping the app around, it wants to do so in a way that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/bytedance-is-willing-to-ditch-tiktok-in-the-us-instead-of-selling-it-off">ByteDance isn't comfortable with</a>.

I sailed through my teens, 20s, and half of my 30s without giving much thought to my long-term health or wondering if a gym life would be the right fit for me. However, something changed around 35, and I've been using smartwatches, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review" target="_blank">Google Pixel Watch 3</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-review" target="_blank">OnePlus Watch 3,</a> to track my heart rate and ensure that I'm not overexerting myself.</p><p>But I'm learning that there's so much more to workout tracking than just heart rate monitoring, and it took the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit/amazfi-balance-2-helio-strap-combo-elevated-features-launch">Amazfit Balance 2</a> to get me to this point. I've been using it for a couple of weeks and have since gone on several hikes, multiple paddleboarding sessions, and plenty of WODs at HEW Fitness, my favorite local CrossFit-style gym.</p><p>And while I've even taken several watches and smart rings <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/two-smartwatches-one-spartan-race-no-winners">on Spartan races</a>, a lot of the data I'm given has to be combed through and manually compared in a way that I don't usually take the time to do. That's all changing for me with the Amazfit Zepp app.</p><h2 id="effortless-tracking-2">Effortless tracking</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="7oTdMJ8GFRsofk9dv3TN5" name="zepp-app-food-logging" alt="Logging an afternoon snack in the Amazfit Zepp app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7oTdMJ8GFRsofk9dv3TN5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Shy of having a robot humanoid alongside me to log everything I do — I'd rather not have that for robot apocalypse reasons, if nothing else — I can't see workout and health tracking getting any easier than what Amazfit has crafted here.</p><p>Let's start with food logging. I'm <em>horrible</em> at logging my food. Even the slightest bit of friction to the experience will make me stop. I've tried all the popular apps over the years and have given up on all of them. Doubtless, something better has come along since the advent of modern AI tools like ChatGPT and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>, but Zepp builds it in for me, and I don't have to juggle multiple apps or services.</p><p>Right on the main screen, I can log food in one of two ways: take a picture or use a voice/text prompt. Just before I wrote this, I went upstairs and grabbed some tuna and crackers for an afternoon snack. I took a picture of the box of crackers and another of the tuna pouch. Bam, afternoon snack logged.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:67.72%;"><img id="NMypiorMyVi5Dk458HLYJW" name="amazfit-zepp-app-ai-powered-food-logging" alt="Logging food in the Zepp app easily with AI voice prompts and photos" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NMypiorMyVi5Dk458HLYJW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1387" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Before that, though, I was really craving some Oreos. I forgot to take a picture of it because I left my phone in my office downstairs, but I know I only took a single serving of Oreos because I'm at least good about looking at the label and grabbing what I should. So I told Zepp I ate "one serving of Oreos." Two seconds later, my poor nutritional choice was logged for AI to judge me with.</p><p>Yep, I could definitely get used to logging food this way. Even taking a quick voice journal of the stuff I ate throughout the day and dropping it into the text prompt section of the app will log everything I ate, from that errant piece of Dominos pizza my friend offered me while we were playing games, to the smoothie I ate with one banana, a cup of almond milk, a tablespoon of peanut butter, and a scoop of protein powder after I left the gym.</p><p>Better yet, the app provides you with insights based on what you've logged, including how much you've exercised, how well you slept, and more. This morning, it suggested that I try adding fruits or vegetables to my breakfast to make it more balanced. After realizing I had forgotten to log my orange juice, that insight alert disappeared.</p><p>Best of all, you don't need a paid subscription or a specific phone to make this all work. This is a dream come true for me, and I can't believe how well it works!</p><h2 id="how-about-the-workouts-2">How about the workouts?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9uktNFJDzKGRG5cML8uTMB" name="amazfit-balance-2-orange-04" alt="The Amazfit Balance 2 smartwatch with an orange band" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9uktNFJDzKGRG5cML8uTMB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While I love the accuracy and comfort of both the Pixel Watch 3 and OnePlus Watch 3, I've never used a watch that understands what I'm doing quite like the Amazfit Balance 2. This week, two of our WODs (Workout Of the Day) at the gym included barbell exercises. I know from wearing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-smartwatch">Samsung Galaxy Watches</a> that some watches are better at tracking workouts like this than others, but the Amazfit Balance 2 was on a totally different level.</p><p>I selected "strength training" before beginning the workout, then selected my weight and the number of reps I planned to do. Each round, I clicked the lower button on the watch, adjusted the weight and number of reps, then hit go.</p><p>After I was done, I sat down to look at the data the watch generated and couldn't believe my eyes. It got all the expected stats — average heart rate, calories burned, etc. — but then I scrolled down and saw the <em>muscle groups</em> I worked. "How could it possibly know this?" I wondered. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">best Garmin watches</a> also offer this feature, but they are often slightly more expensive than Amazfit's watches, and I find the app to be somewhat convoluted.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="HChTLpELzoU6C8iitmjhE7" name="amazfit-balance-2-amazfit-zepp-app-workouts-01" alt="Looking at workout stats on the Zepp app next to the Amazfit Balance 2 smartwatch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HChTLpELzoU6C8iitmjhE7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Scrolling one more "page" down revealed the answer. During each rep, the Amazfit Balance 2 uses its sophisticated sensors to identify exactly what you're doing during those logged reps. But this isn't just some generic list of activities; this is a list of <strong>thousands</strong> of things, all sorted by different muscle groups.</p><p>OK, so it picked up my deadlifts correctly on Tuesday, but how about Friday's back squats? Surely these activities are similar enough to trick it? Nope. Right in the app after my workout today, "Barbell squats" stared me in the face. It's been a long time since I've felt like technology was magic — my job makes me a little jaded, what can I say — but <em>man</em>, does this feel like magic.</p><p>If that wasn't enough, it also gives me insights for consistency, stability, continuity, rhythm, and speed decay, all with personalized descriptions that actually make sense. Otherwise, I'm not sure I'd be able to interpret this data in a meaningful way.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:65.82%;"><img id="Ht3DpiQXFv9ehiSUP5fjJD" name="amazfit-zepp-app-detailed-workout-tracking" alt="Detailed workout data collected by the Amazfit Balance 2 smartwatch, compiled in an easy to read way by the Zepp app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ht3DpiQXFv9ehiSUP5fjJD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1348" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The rest of the watch is just as fantastic as this experience, too. So far, it's lasted me nearly a week on a single charge, and there's nothing here that feels like it's a lesser experience when compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">best Wear OS watches</a>.</p><p>Zepp has an app store that offers a wide range of content, from utilities like calculators to games like Sudoku, yoga courses, and more. I'm not someone who uses extra apps on smartwatches very often, but everything I felt like I needed to use was either already included on the watch or found in the Zepp app store.</p><p>And, much to my surprise, responding to messages on the watch was as easy as could be. At first, I was confused because you have to swipe on a notification to get actions for it — this seems more like an iOS paradigm than an Android one — but once I figured this out, things were swell.</p><p>I've been super impressed with smartwatches lately. The Amazfit Balance 2 feels like another upgrade on my previous favorite, the OnePlus Watch 3, and I think you'll love it, too!</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="94122f63-789d-4818-a9d6-dde0de924257">            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazfit-Balance-Sapphire-Display-Offline-Battery/dp/B0F9JFCYNX/" data-model-name="Amazfit Balance 2" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:109.33%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oSaiNZg6ZDAPszhXuEhQvg.jpg' alt="An official product render of the Amazfit Balance 2 smartwatch with an orange band"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Amazfit Balance 2</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Get insightful AI-powered coaching that actually works!

We're still waiting for this to happen, but we do at least know what Garmin data you'll be able to share to other Android fitness apps.</p><p>This <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.garmin.com/en-US/?faq=JToBEy0jfe6pIygark2Ui5">Garmin Support page</a> describes the activity data that Garmin Connect will share after a workout in a "one-way transfer" to Health Connect:</p><ul><li>Active and Total Calories burned</li><li>Cycling Pedal Cadence</li><li>Distance</li><li>Elevation Gained</li><li>Heart Rate data</li><li>Speed information</li><li>Steps</li><li>Swimming Strokes</li></ul><p>Aside from running power, cadence, and sweat loss, most of Garmin's core workout data will be shared with other apps.</p><p>More generally, Garmin Connect will share the following Wellness data to Google Health Connect:</p><ul><li>Body Fat</li><li>Calories Burned</li><li>Floors Climbed</li><li>Heart Rate Data</li><li>Sleep Data</li><li>Steps and Step Distance</li><li>Weight</li></ul><p>While "Sleep Data" is vague, we hope that it includes specific stats like blood oxygen saturation, heart rate variability, body temperature, and resting heart rate — all categories that Health Connect can share.

The support page says that "Garmin will not receive any data from Google," which means you can't do a workout with a Galaxy or Pixel Watch and see the results in Garmin Connect.</p><p>As of the morning of June 30, the latest Play Store update of Health Connect doesn't show Garmin Connect.

There are roughly 30 new features that are on the way and rolling out today (June 30) for no extra cost. Gemini and NotebookLM are at the core of a few features educators can expect "in the coming months." Regarding the former, Google states educators can soon utilize Gems (custom Gemini versions) for their students.</p><p>Teachers can create a specific variant of Gemini based on their teaching material. This will create a Gemini that's an "expert" in that particular subject, bringing tailored assistance to students who may need extra help or would like to dive deeper into their learning.</p><p>NotebookLM comes in to create "interactive study guides and podcast-style Audio Overviews." Students can run through these guides to understand them better in a more condensed way, and the Audio Overviews can open chances for questions.</p><h2 id="furthering-education-with-a-gemini-assistant-2">Furthering Education with a Gemini Assistant</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1070px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.07%;"><img id="rpwvDPGHucAzWdhD2RnS2A" name="google-classroom-notebooklm-study-guide" alt="Google Classroom gains NotebookLM to create useful study guides for students with Audio Overviews." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rpwvDPGHucAzWdhD2RnS2A.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1070" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1197px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:50.13%;"><img id="WoxfsUQznzofZCuCAS3zz9" name="google-classroom-ai-teaching-tools" alt="Google is rolling out over 30 new AI features for educators, like create a lesson plan or create a rubric or quiz." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WoxfsUQznzofZCuCAS3zz9.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1197" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>What teachers can expect starting today (June 30), Google highlights Gemini's ability to "generate content from a central destination in Classroom."

When it comes to creating lesson plans with Gemini, Google states educators need to provide a "target grade and topic" before the AI can deliver a first draft. Teachers can continue to revise the lesson plan with Gemini, as it suggests potential useful videos and more.</p><p>These features are starting to roll out globally for educators in English "over the coming weeks." If you're interested in joining Google's pilot program, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://edu.google.com/pilot/">sign up for the AI track</a> in Classroom.</p><p>To end, Google highlighted a few features that it has plans to implement in Classroom for educators. These features include a more "flexible" Read Along mode. Teachers can now upload their own content; however, there are plans to introduce Gemini-created stories for "real-time support" for books students may be interested in. Educators are also gaining a "silent reading mode" and a "listening mode" soon for comprehension insights.</p><p>Soon, Classroom will receive support for the learning standards of learning institutions. Google says it knows that not every institution abides by the same standards, so it has partnered with 1EdTech and Common Good Learning Tools to give such places the ability to publish their standard via CASE Network 2. Moreover, "in the coming months," educators will be able to "tag coursework with relevant learning standards or skills, and view new analytics of student performance."</p><p>Google reiterates an earlier Classroom rollout in June that brought <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/06/new-class-analytics-and-insights-in-google-classroom.html">new analytics and insights</a> to educators about their students.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Looking at what each phone brings to the table can help you decide which is a better fit, especially if you’re looking for performance, long battery life, or reliable long-term software support.</p><p>The Moto G Stylus 2025 adds a few standout features, like wireless charging and a built-in stylus. But Samsung’s Galaxy A36 holds its ground with more software updates and a sleeker overall design. Lets take a deeper look at thiese two mid-range phones.</p><h2 id="moto-g-stylus-2025-vs-samsung-galaxy-a36-design-2">Moto G Stylus 2025 vs. Samsung Galaxy A36: Design</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uPmSt4JEmxH9vhB6DMzcZ7" name="Moto-G-Stylus-2025-review-6" alt="Moto G Stylus 2025 face down with the pen on top" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uPmSt4JEmxH9vhB6DMzcZ7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As expected in this Moto G Stylus 2025 vs Samsung Galaxy A36 analysis, the two phones share more than a few design choices. Both feature an under-display fingerprint sensor, a plastic frame, a USB-C port, right-side buttons, and rounded corners. Beyond those shared design options, the Moto G Stylus 2025 adopts a more distinctive design approach.</p><p>Motorola’s phone borrows design cues from its premium lineup, with a look that loosely resembles the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-50-ultra-launch" target="_blank">Edge 50 Ultra</a>. It stands out with a stove-like camera housing and a vegan leather back, offering more texture and grip than the Galaxy’s smooth glass. It's also slightly lighter, weighing 191g, and comes in two bold Pantone shades: Gibraltar Sea (deep blue) and Surf the Web (vibrant medium blue).</p><p>The phone measures 162.2 x 74.8 x 8.3mm and is protected by Gorilla Glass 3, which is noticeably less durable than Samsung’s choice. However, Motorola compensates for this with a higher IP68 rating, making the phone more water-resistant than the Galaxy A36, which Samsung claims can survive submersion up to 1.5 meters for 30 minutes.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1062px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.31%;"><img id="x29TmvkFSEihfYMYfBi3Gb" name="samsung-galaxy-a36-5g-lifestyle-official-169.jpg" alt="Galaxy A36 5G lifestyle ad" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/x29TmvkFSEihfYMYfBi3Gb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1062" height="598" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While Motorola goes for bold and textured, the Galaxy A36 leans into Samsung's signature sleekness. The phone has a more refined shape than previous A-series models, featuring flat edges and subtle curves around the buttons that make it more comfortable to hold. Thinner bezels give the display a more modern look, and the new pill-shaped camera layout gives it a more cohesive rear design.</p><p>Samsung opted for Gorilla Glass Victus Plus on the front and a glass back that gives it a more premium look. Whether you prefer something subtle or bold, the phone is available in black, white, lime, and lavender. It weighs 195g, making it heavier than the Moto, and measures 162.9 x 78.2 x 7.4mm. The Galaxy A36 boasts a respectable IP67 rating, but it falls short of its rival's higher protection level.</p><h2 id="moto-g-stylus-2025-vs-samsung-galaxy-a36-display-2">Moto G Stylus 2025 vs. Samsung Galaxy A36: Display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NTqHZmim9npGfBE5EkL5hL" name="samsung galaxy a36 gaming" alt="Samsung Galaxy A36" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NTqHZmim9npGfBE5EkL5hL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Both phones feature a 6.7-inch display with a 120Hz refresh. However, Samsung uses a Super AMOLED panel on the Galaxy A36, while the Moto G Stylus 2025 opts for a standard pOLED. That gives Samsung a slight edge in color tuning and contrast, especially in bright environments.</p><p>Where they really start to differ is in brightness, resolution, and overall utility. The Moto G Stylus 2025 pushes ahead with a higher 1220 x 2712 resolution, 3,000-nit peak brightness, and a larger 89.3% screen-to-body ratio. It also comes with a built-in stylus, making it more practical for note-taking and creative work.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy A36 has a lower peak brightness of 1,900 nits and a 1080 x 2340 resolution, accompanied by a smaller screen-to-body ratio of 86.5%. Between the sharper resolution, higher peak brightness, and extra utility of the stylus, the Moto G Stylus 2025 clearly comes out ahead in this category.</p><h2 id="moto-g-stylus-2025-vs-samsung-galaxy-a36-hardware-and-specs-2">Moto G Stylus 2025 vs. Samsung Galaxy A36: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1597px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="ooFZxsECmu2UZXsCbmsCEC" name="Samsung-Galaxy-A36-5G-snapdragon" alt="The Galaxy A36" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ooFZxsECmu2UZXsCbmsCEC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1597" height="898" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Both Android phones share a surprising amount of hardware for two budget-friendly phones.

The Moto G Stylus 2025 supports 68W wired charging and even incorporates 15W wireless charging, a rare feature in this price range. It comes with a 50MP Sony LYTIA 700C sensor, a 13MP ultrawide, and a 32MP front-facing camera that shoots 4K videos and delivers impressive detail. You can expand the Moto G Stylus 2025’s storage up to 1TB via microSD, and it comes in a single 8GB RAM configuration that still runs smoothly.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy A36 includes a triple camera setup with a 50MP Sony IMX882 sensor, an 8MP ultrawide lens, and a 5MP macro lens. Both the front and back cameras can also record in 4K, but the selfie camera on this model is only 12MP. Samsung offers more flexibility with 6GB, 8GB, or 12GB of RAM, but availability varies by region, and the Galaxy A36 doesn’t offer expandable storage.

If you want a built-in stylus, faster charging, and a clean Android interface, the Moto G Stylus 2025 is an easy recommendation. However, if long-term support and more storage options are more important to you, Samsung offers a stronger overall value.</p><p>The A36's six years of updates are hard to ignore, but Motorola counters with useful extras, such as stylus support and a less cluttered interface. At this price, neither phone is a bad choice. It just depends on what matters more to you.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="94d7ac5e-ce75-4227-b776-3a884669e9ff">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Q8hjHr8JG7Yu36wce5jTT5.jpg' alt="Motorola Moto G Stylus 2025"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Motorola G Stylus 2025</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Wireless charging and built-in stylus</strong></em></p><p>The Moto G Stylus 2025 stands out with extras you rarely see under $400, including 68W fast charging, 15W wireless charging, and a built-in stylus.

However, it is likely that the upcoming tri-fold phone isn’t S Pen-friendly as the handset is expected not to feature the digitizer.</p><p>Further, the handset could be coming with a “G-shaped fold style” — a supposedly inward folding mechanism.

Considering that NotebookLM started out as a limited research project in 2023, earning its own mobile app is a big milestone for the AI-powered study tool.</p><p>Although the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> mobile app has almost completely replaced the web-based equivalent for me, I was skeptical that this would be the same for the NotebookLM app.</p><p>Despite the name, NotebookLM isn't a note-taker like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-keep">Google Keep</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/it-still-sucks-that-the-iphone-gets-new-apps-before-android">Notion</a>. It's more of a research and study tool, capable of using AI to parse and converse about complex topics with a lot of specific context.</p><p>As it turns out, I was both right and wrong to be skeptical of NotebookLM's Android app. It's going to be a helpful companion for existing NotebookLM users, but it likely won't be a great first impression of the service for new users. The Gemini-powered research tool is simply better suited for the desktop — let me explain why.</p><h2 id="what-s-good-about-the-notebooklm-mobile-app-2">What's good about the NotebookLM mobile app </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="esENjZVHzxQ7UN259jGHxi" name="NotebookLM-Android-app-5" alt="The Studio tab in the NotebookLM app for Android running on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/esENjZVHzxQ7UN259jGHxi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Let's start with a high-level overview of what NotebookLM does. It takes a collection of sources about a topic to form a "notebook." Each of these sources can contain up to 500,000 words, and you can put 50 of them into a single notebook. This gives your NotebookLM project its own context based on the sources provided, whether they be websites, YouTube videos, PDF files, or your own notes.</p><p>After you've selected your sources, a Gemini model within NotebookLM gets to work. It's not always clear <em>which</em> Gemini model is at work — Google seems to update it often, but we know it's at least a tweaked version of Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking. Considering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-2-5-pro-and-flash-go-public-as-google-announces-new-flash-lite-model">the Gemini 2.5 series is already stable and public</a>, it's possible the model working behind the scenes has been updated.</p><p>From there, NotebookLM can do a lot — including chat with you based on the context of your sources, provide summaries, generate spoken Audio Overviews, and more.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GEaCNGk4w6kuzx7GXF2bpi" name="NotebookLM-Android-app-2" alt="The button in the NotebookLM app for Android that lets you join an Audio Overview conversation." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GEaCNGk4w6kuzx7GXF2bpi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The mobile version of NotebookLM works best with notebooks you've already created. After opening the app for the first time, you're greeted with a list of your existing notebooks alongside the option to create a new one. With sources already uploaded, one of your current notebooks is ready to go for text-based chats or spoken Audio Overviews.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/notebooklm-audio-overviews-radio-like-ai">Audio Overviews</a> are the best part of the NotebookLM app, as they can be downloaded to your device for offline listening. Of course, this takes a while — the generation process for an Audio Overview takes around 5-10 minutes, and the download takes additional time on top of that. It's such a lengthy process that the app reminds you that you can close it and do something else while an Audio Overview is created. And sometimes, it'll fail entirely.</p><p>But when it does work, it's pretty glorious. You can listen to the podcast-style Audio Overview based on your study topic while driving, taking the train, or doing just about everything else. Downloaded content helps eliminate some of the stutters you might experience while trying to play an Audio Overview on a mobile network. You can also "join" an Audio Overview to get your podcast hosts on the exact topic you need help with, which is neat.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7hdadu3ou4FF7KWC6TXV2i" name="NotebookLM-Android-app-6" alt="The NotebookLM app for Android running on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7hdadu3ou4FF7KWC6TXV2i.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Audio Overviews are perhaps the most popular feature included with NotebookLM — so popular that they've since been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-gets-new-features-canvas-audio-overviews">added to the Gemini app</a> and an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-ai-search-test-understand-confusing-topics-test">experiment in Search Labs</a>. Really, it feels like the NotebookLM mobile app for iOS and Android is just a player for Audio Overviews, because aside from the chat function, there's not much else this app can do at the moment.</p><p>That doesn't have to be a bad thing, but it's important to keep your expectations tame if you try this app as a potential replacement for your favorite note-taker.</p><h2 id="what-s-bad-about-the-notebooklm-mobile-app-2">What's bad about the NotebookLM mobile app</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WVC4YcFLZzpaiVtFyaEKLh" name="NotebookLM-Android-app-1" alt="The homepage of NotebookLM app for Android running on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WVC4YcFLZzpaiVtFyaEKLh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The limitations of the NotebookLM mobile app compared to the web client are why I kept wanting to use the fully-featured desktop experience instead. One of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/notebooklm-can-now-help-you-discover-sources-on-the-web">the best NotebookLM features added recently</a> is called <strong>Discover sources</strong>, and it effectively takes the work out of your hands when creating a new notebook. You'll type in a few keywords, like "Algebra I" or "The American Revolution," and NotebookLM will find good sources on the web and automatically add 10 of them to a new notebook.</p><p>There's also an <strong>I'm feeling curious</strong> button, which is a nod to Google Search's <strong>I'm feeling lucky </strong>button. As you might have guessed, this tool picks a random topic, finds sources about it, and adds it to a new notebook. It's perfect for the curious-minded person who just loves to learn new things.</p><p>I was excited to use this feature in the NotebookLM mobile app, but I quickly found out that it wasn't there. It's quite disappointing because the process of adding sources to a notebook using the Android app is tedious. It involves a ton of window-switching and copying that isn't suited for a small screen, even if the NotebookLM shortcut in the Android share card is handy.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FnBoP3fWh9CL34MmRodxki" name="NotebookLM-Android-app-7" alt="Adding sources to the NotebookLM app for Android running on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FnBoP3fWh9CL34MmRodxki.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Put simply, it feels like a missed opportunity, and it isn't the only one. You also can't <em>create</em> a note on the NotebookLM mobile app. On the web, you can make a brand-new, text-based note in a notebook on the fly and later convert it to a source. This feature is notably absent on the mobile app, and it severely limits its capabilities as an Android note-taker.</p><h2 id="for-now-the-notebooklm-web-client-isn-t-going-anywhere-2">For now, the NotebookLM web client isn't going anywhere</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9CfK7npL5W75YZpYFzEdph" name="NotebookLM-Android-app-4" alt="The NotebookLM app for Android running on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9CfK7npL5W75YZpYFzEdph.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>To be fair, Google is aware of these limitations. In its introductory blog post, the company said that "this first version of the app includes many of the core features of NotebookLM — with more refinements and features to come in the months ahead." I'm hopeful that in the future, the NotebookLM app will become on par with its desktop counterpart.</p><p>For now, though, the NotebookLM app on iOS and Android isn't that useful. It's the only way to download Audio Overviews to your mobile device, so if that feature sounds appealing to you, it's worth using. Otherwise, you should probably stick to the web client — that's what I'm going to do.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Having used the StormBox Blast, the all-new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/tribit-stormbox-blast-2-ultimate-bluetooth-party-speaker">StormBox Blast 2</a>, and the diminutive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/tribit-stormbox-2-review">StormBox 2</a>, I can say with some confidence that Tribit knows what it's doing in this area.</p><p>The Blast 2 continues to be a terrific all-rounder if you need a party speaker, but it is quite heavy, and it's overkill in most situations. That's where the StormBox Lava slots in; it is considerably smaller — and easily portable — but you still get 80W of sound in total, and all the extras. The StormBox Lava is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Tribit-StormBox-Portable-Bluetooth-Waterproof/dp/B0DN5F9BC2">available for $139 on Amazon</a>, and that's a decent value when you consider the caliber of the sound.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="BHK8oZCULJBhVgXsxvEpdT" name="Tribit StormBox Lava" alt="Tribit StormBox Lava Bluetooth review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BHK8oZCULJBhVgXsxvEpdT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Like other StormBox products, the Lava has a design that doesn't grab much attention. It's sold in a black color option, and while the build quality is great, you miss out on fun colors that are offered with Bose and Ultimate Ears products. That's a minor quibble as these things go, because the color ultimately doesn't make much of a difference in usability.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="rS8i9zmSaBJifrdyosUWoT" name="Tribit StormBox Lava" alt="Tribit StormBox Lava Bluetooth review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rS8i9zmSaBJifrdyosUWoT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Lava has an oblong design, and while it doesn't have 360-degree sound, you get four audio drivers that deliver a total of 80W of power. The back of the unit houses the ports — behind a protective cap — and you get USB-A alongside USB-C and a 3.5mm jack. Thankfully, the Lava charges via the standard USB-C port, so you don't have to worry about using a dedicated barrel connector.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="BHK8oZCULJBhVgXsxvEpdT" name="Tribit StormBox Lava" alt="Tribit StormBox Lava Bluetooth review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BHK8oZCULJBhVgXsxvEpdT.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="jbtekFH8wyUoiJuW26aSZT" name="Tribit StormBox Lava" alt="Tribit StormBox Lava Bluetooth review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jbtekFH8wyUoiJuW26aSZT.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5080" height="2861" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="FZw2LkmgKiJf9VcNyNGYTT" name="Tribit StormBox Lava" alt="Tribit StormBox Lava Bluetooth review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FZw2LkmgKiJf9VcNyNGYTT.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>What I like about the Lava is that it gets a strap that lets you carry it around.

Like other Tribit products, the focus is clearly on low-end energy, and the Lava produces a rumbling bass that makes listening to modern music highly enjoyable.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4931px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="ZtabToD8GvfUEkNHFiE4FT" name="Tribit StormBox Lava" alt="Tribit StormBox Lava Bluetooth review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZtabToD8GvfUEkNHFiE4FT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4931" height="2777" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you need even more bass, the custom XBass mode provides a noticeable difference to the rumble and energy. The sound quality in general is oriented toward bass-focused music, and if that's what you like listening to, you'll definitely enjoy the tonality of the Lava.</p><p>Tribit lets you adjust the sound to some degree via its mobile app, and although there isn't a 10-band EQ, you get to tweak the sound in a meaningful way. The speaker has rubber feet at the bottom that ensures it stays planted, and at 6.13lb, it isn't heavy enough that it's cumbersome to carry.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="BoDd4rvrXBJpF8iQ2h7TeT" name="Tribit StormBox Lava" alt="Tribit StormBox Lava Bluetooth review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BoDd4rvrXBJpF8iQ2h7TeT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A lot of that weight has to do with the battery; the StormBox Lava has a 42.3Wh battery, and it delivers over 18 hours of use between charges with XBass mode enabled. That's a good thing, because charging the speaker takes over five hours, and there's no fast charging. An interesting addition is reverse charging — you can use the Lava to charge your phone at 10W.</p><p>The only feature that's missing is high-res codecs; the Lava has the standard SBC and AAC codecs, and you don't get any AptX. This is an issue with most Bluetooth speakers anyway, and honestly, it isn't a huge limiting factor. At the end of the day, the StormBox Lava produces highly detailed sound with a clear bass-focused signature, and it's a definite contender if you need a powerful Bluetooth party speaker.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="0d40b006-9df4-49c6-8ead-fb1e9140089c">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:67.29%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VQxtChvydi678rAbtAoptm.jpg' alt="Tribit StormBox Lava"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Tribit StormBox Lava</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>With powerful sound and a portable design, the Lava is a terrific Bluetooth party speaker. </p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>
