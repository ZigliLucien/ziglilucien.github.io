<ul><li>Samsung listed three unreleased A-series Galaxy phones on its Chilean service website.</li><li>The phones are the Samsung Galaxy A26 5G (SM-A266), Samsung Galaxy A36 5G (SM-A366), and Samsung Galaxy A56 5G (SM-A566).</li><li>This listing suggests a release is imminent and the phones should debut next month.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung has a few new Galaxy A-series budget smartphones in the pipeline, and that's not just a rumor anymore. The company updated the service list on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/cl/support/outofwarrantyservice/" target="_blank">Chilean website</a> to include the unreleased Galaxy A56, Galaxy A36, and Galaxy A26, which are expected to release next month. The listings include the official retail names and model numbers for the devices, as first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-lists-galaxy-a56-galaxy-a36-galaxy-a26-its-website/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>.</p><p>Additionally, the listing confirms that the Galaxy A56, Galaxy A36, and Galaxy A26 will be sold in Chile. The website includes the price list for out-of-warranty repairs for Galaxy phones, including now the unreleased A-series devices. Since they aren't out yet, the repair prices are simply listed as "not available," which is unsurprising. However, it does share the official names and model numbers for the devices, which are the following:</p>
<ul><li>Samsung Galaxy A26 5G (SM-A266)</li><li>Samsung Galaxy A36 5G (SM-A366)</li><li>Samsung Galaxy A56 5G (SM-A566)</li></ul>
<p>The inclusion of upcoming A-series Galaxy phones on the service list suggests that a release is imminent. The phones are expected to launch in the first week or two in March, just like their predecessors.</p>

<p>According to prior leaks, the Samsung Galaxy A56 5G may be powered by a Samsung Exynos 1580 chipset and could support 45W wired charging for the first time. However, that's unclear at the moment. While leaks <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/new-galaxy-a56-and-galaxy-a36-renders-surface">revealed the design of the Galaxy A56</a>, the exact specifications are shrouded in a bit more secrecy.</p><p>The refreshed design likely includes a unibody rear camera housing with three cameras, covered by a black shell — mimicking the DSLR-style covers that already appeared on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Samsung Galaxy S25 series</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>. The Galaxy A56 could come in pink, gray, and green, with the cheaper Galaxy A36 being available in green, gray, and purple, per leaks.</p><p>We'll learn more about all three models — the Samsung Galaxy A56 5G, Galaxy A36 5G, and Galaxy A26 5G — as this official confirmation is a sign release is nearing.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google is highlighting the various uses of Pixel Call Assist on its smartphones, while also drawing attention to new updates.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/pixel-call-assist-call-notes-tips/">blog post</a>, the company detailed a couple of ways users can lean on the Phone app to handle "too many spam calls." While Pixels can conduct a reverse number search for unknown calls, Google is preparing to roll out a new set of filters. The post states the Phone app will soon roll out five filters: All, Missed, Contacts, Non-Spam, and Spam.</p><p>These filters will be available in the "Recent" tab of the Phone app once it hits devices. The post did not state when this update will begin rolling out on Android.</p><p>Google also detailed an upcoming update for the Pixel phone call interface (UI). The company states the update is aimed at making the Pixel Call Assist feature quicker to access. Additionally, the update will make tools like Call Notes, Direct My Call, and Audio Emoji much easier to find and utilize.</p><p>Regarding that note, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/20/pixel-phone-call-redesign-filters/">9to5Google</a> post shed some light on this, stating the UI update has supposedly arrived on the Pixel 9 series. The publication highlights Google's slight UI rework, which displays a row above your standard phone call tools (numpad, mute, etc.).</p><p>There, users will find a Call Assist button that opens to offer its features, as well as a way to expand the Audio Emoji function.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:450px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:133.33%;"><img id="eAhRyzrK4dG3rebFRV2dvA" name="google-phone-app-filters-recent-view-addition" alt="The Phone app on Android will receive five filters to help users organize their recent calls." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eAhRyzrK4dG3rebFRV2dvA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="450" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The post draws attention to a couple of other useful Phone call features like Live Caption and Call Screen. The former is a useful accessibility tool that lets users who are deaf or hard of hearing to read what's being said on the other end. Additionally, those users will be given a keyboard to type their response and the app will read what you've said to them.</p><p>Call Screen lets users allow the AI to answer a phone call or "Ask if urgent." What's said on the other end will be relayed to you via text on your display. More importantly, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-vs-pixel-9-pro">Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro</a> deliver "AI-powered suggested replies" if toggled on.</p><p>Google started rolling out its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-phone-audio-emoji-update-spotted">Audio Emoji update</a> last spring, which made calls much more expressive. These quirky emojis play a unique sound (depending on the emoji) alongside a fun animation on their display. Six emojis were present during the feature's arrival like the laughing emoji, party favors, and drum.</p><p>The Phone app received a beta late last year for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/real-time-scam-detection-is-rolling-out-now-in-google-phone-app-beta">real-time scam detection</a>. The feature is AI-based and is a tool that automatically runs in the background. Google states that the detector will scan incoming calls and, if they are (potentially) a scam, it will deliver a bright red pop-up to users about it. The pop-up will let you quickly end the call to avoid accidentally giving personal information.</p>

<hr>
<p>Amazon is discontinuing its app store on Android devices starting Aug. 20 this year. In an update to App developers, the company stated that they will no longer be accepting new apps for the store moving forward(via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/20/amazon-is-shutting-down-its-app-store-on-android/?guccounter=1">TechCrunch</a>). Developers can continue to update existing apps on the Appstore until the above deadline.</p><p>The Amazon Appstore is currently available in 200 countries and allows users to download games and mobile apps on supported devices.  It is a third-party app store that comes pre-installed on all Amazon devices.</p><p>However, it has always been an alternative Appstore for Android users that offers free apps and content that isn't found on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-play">Google Play Store.</a></p><p>On its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/mas/appstore/android/faq" target="_blank">FAQ page</a>, Amazon stated that "any apps downloaded from the Amazon Appstore will not be guaranteed to operate on Android devices," after Aug.20.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Oh wait what, Amazon App Store discontinued on Android Devices. pic.twitter.com/CQvxcXe4LP<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1892543928638861606">February 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>An Amazon spokesperson told Android Central in an email that it has decided to take this step with Android devices as the company is looking inward and wants to focus its efforts "on the Appstore experience on our own devices, as that’s where the overwhelming majority of our customers currently engage with it.”</p><p>According to the company, only a small number of customers use the app store outside Amazon devices, which pushed them to take this step.</p><p>Amazon added that its virtual currency aka Amazon Coins, which users use to purchase eligible apps and in-app items from the Appstore will also be discontinued. The company will refund unused coins to users after Aug.20. That said, the Appstore will remain untouched on Amazon's devices like the Fire TV and Fire Tablet.</p><p>It looks like Amazon is following suit after what went down with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/windows-11-ending-android-app-support-announcement" target="_blank">Microsoft devices last year</a>. Windows 11 users at least got a year's headstart on this shift. As of  March 5, even Microsoft devices will no longer support several apps available on the Amazon Appstore once this date arrives.</p>

The fund aims to reward creators with cash prizes and a way to earn an income through Meta's Roblox-like game, including a new expansion to mobile that launched last Fall in the Meta Horizon app on iOS and Android.</p>

<p>Meta says the new fund is designed to appeal to a growing audience of players <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/the-good-and-bad-of-meta-quest-growth-in-2024">who prefer free-to-play content</a>, similar to audiences on other mobile platforms. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developers.meta.com/horizon/blog/empowering-horizon-creators-with-a-new-50m-fund-and-advanced-tools-for-mobile-and-mr-worlds">Meta's blog post</a> on the announcement says the new move is aimed to grow these mobile, non-VR audiences by reaching "a lot of new people who don’t yet own a Quest headset and ultimately grow the pie for everyone."</p><p>The logic, Meta dictates, is that people who enjoy Horizon Worlds will be more inclined to purchase a Meta Quest headset to try the experiences in VR. But Meta couldn't be more wrong here, and while I ultimately think hybrid experiences like this — that means VR and non-VR players can game with each other — are the future of gaming as a whole, Meta's focus on Horizon Worlds is simply unhealthy for everyone.</p><p>Meta's CTO recently said that 2025 would be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-q4-2024-earnings">make-or-break year</a> for Horizon Worlds, so while it's not surprising to see the company make a last-ditch effort to catalyze better development for Horizon Worlds, it's beyond frustrating to see the company continue to push the Roblox-like platform over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">best Meta Quest games</a> at the expense of existing VR developers.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, I fully believed that Meta Horizon Worlds could co-exist with more premium experiences like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/batman-arkham-shadow-review">Batman Arkham Shadow</a>. Other platforms seem to have no problem juggling the balance between offering free-to-play and premium experiences to users who prefer one over the other, but Meta has shown that it's not very good at multitasking.</p><p>Instead, a quick visit to the Meta Horizon app on your phone always shows a ton of Horizon Worlds content that you may or may not want. The premium app store can be found by clicking a tiny icon on the top left of the app, and promotional content for these kinds of experiences has substantially waned over the past six months.</p><p>This huge shift in focus for Meta has had a profound impact on the VR industry, as a whole. Instead of developers seeing record game sales after the launch of a new headset, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-review">Meta Quest 3S</a> launch was decidedly different. Many VR developers saw flat or even lower sales throughout the Holiday 2024 period when compared to 2023, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/from-quest-to-horizon-how-metas-shifting-priorities-are-affecting-developers/">the results haven't been pretty</a>.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Meta's choice to promote Horizon Worlds content over paid apps from developers is causing unnecessary and irreparable harm to the VR market as a whole.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Lots of video game developers have closed their doors or made substantial layoffs this year. While this unfortunate reality isn't relegated just to the VR market, it hurts more in VR because there aren't as many bigger developers as on traditional consoles or PC. Just in the last month alone, we've seen major layoffs at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/toast-interactive-closes-office-as-majority-of-staff-are-made-redundant-2/">Toast Interactive</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/crytek-laying-off-15-percent-of-staff/">Crytek</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/fast-travel-games-layoffs-january-2025/">Fast Travel Games</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/soul-assembly-layoffs-january-2025/">Soul Assembly</a>, and even the app market <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/sidequest-holds-layoffs-amid-changing-market/">SideQuest</a>.</p><p>Wider industry trends are somewhat to blame for these problems, but Meta's choice to promote Horizon Worlds content over paid apps from developers is causing unnecessary and irreparable harm to the VR market as a whole.</p><p>I had already planned to write this post before I found out about Meta's new creator program, and its existence only further solidifies my opinion here. The first thing you see when opening the <em>required </em>Meta Quest companion app isn't the best games on the platform. It's janky free-to-play garbage that's an instant turn-off to anyone who isn't 8 years old, and that's a <strong>huge</strong> problem.</p>

<p>Meta, it's time to give up the ghost. Horizon Worlds isn't going to be The Oasis from Ready Player One. It's not even going to be Rec Room or VR Chat, two <em>very</em> successful VR "metaverse-style" experiences that existed far before Horizon Worlds was ever a twinkle in Mark Zuckerberg's eye.</p><p>Mr. Zuckerberg, if you're reading this, it's OK to accept Horizon Worlds as a "failure" to capitalize early enough on a growing trend. So instead of tanking the successful Quest ecosystem and its development community, focus on the best experiences available on the platform and start promoting those, instead.</p><p>With the VP of VR on the way out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/mark-rabkin-leaving-meta-quest">at the end of the month</a>, this is the perfect time for his replacement to focus on the <em>real</em> metaverse of apps and games that Quest players know and love. Get back to that early 2024 time frame when developers were seeing huge growth and success in their titles with the swath of new players. The Quest 3S just broke sales records, and that should translate into game sales. This fixation on Horizon Worlds could kill off the VR ecosystem you've spent years building up and no one wants that.</p>

<hr>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/among-us-vr-review">Among Us VR</a> launched as one of our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games/2#section-best-quest-3-2-multiplayer-games">favorite multiplayer Quest games</a>, but despite several major updates since 2022, it can be hard to keep a steady user base with so many Quest gamers spending their time in Horizon Worlds or new Gorilla Tag clones. So Schell Games is turning to non-VR Steam gamers with "Among Us 3D," and it's a sign that crossplay might be the best future for VR games.</p><p>Announced on Thursday, Among Us 3D is a new Steam PC port of the original Among Us VR game. Starting as a demo during Steam Next Fest from February 24–March 3, Among Us 3D will eventually let Steam gamers play as crewmates and imposters with VR gamers on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Quest 3</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-review">Quest 3S</a>, PSVR 2, and Steam VR.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UYMaaMTgxa4" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>"With Among Us 3D, we're excited to bring the first-person perspective to an even wider audience," said Ryan Hall, project director at Schell Games. "By uniting VR and PC players, we're opening up even more ways to brutally betray your friends — your whole crew can get in on the fun!"</p><p>Among Us 3D is available to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3168600/Among_Us_3D/">wishlist on Steam</a> today, though there's currently no release date. Among Us VR on Quest will be "rebranded to Among Us 3D" in the coming months, adding a new in-game currency called Stardust to "expand customization options" and "support the expansion of the game." It's possible that Schell Games wants the original Quest game ready before launching the non-VR port.</p><p>After the full launch, Schell and Innersloth are promsing new modes and tasks, as well as "collabs" with the original Among Us. Despite the image below, don't expect actual crossplay between the 2D and 3D Among Us versions: It simply refers to original, fan-favorite cosmetics coming to the 3D version.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7EwN4GfmubZgvojWuvhP78" name="among-us-3d-roadmap" alt="Among Us 3D roadmap: Engineer role out now, Stardust and Among Us 3D launch/ Among Us VR rebrand "coming soon," and future plans (in no particular order): "New modes, new tasks, more limited time events, collabs, wardrobe expansion, and MORE!!!"" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7EwN4GfmubZgvojWuvhP78.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Innersloth / Schell Games)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Despite having fewer maps than the main version, Among Us VR impressed us with its loving recreation of Skeld and seamless VR motion controls for beloved tasks, as well as proximity chat to make you truly feel like a crewmate in danger or an imposter listening for witnesses. And we appreciated post-launch updates like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/among-us-polus-hands-on">Polus Point map</a>.</p><p>With Among Us 3D, Schell Games is committing to continuing to support the VR version, but using an influx of Steam gamers to keep funding their work and add fresh bodies to their murderous little world. The main question will be how the VR-centric controls have been ported to keyboard-and-mouse controls.</p>

<p>Meta Quest games are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/the-good-and-bad-of-meta-quest-growth-in-2024">going through a free-to-play crisis</a>. The Quest Store overall is making more money than ever, but most often via in-app purchases in free-to-play titles. Meta's metaverse is a jumble of Gorilla Tag clones attracting younger gamers, while the more polished VR titles struggle to get proper storefront space or make back their development costs.</p><p>We've seen how many of the best VR multiplayer games have struggled with user retention, or else didn't make enough money to keep up with updates; Echo: VR is the most notorious example, shutting down despite its critical acclaim and avid fanbase.</p><p>Now, with Among Us VR turning into Among Us 3D, we're seeing a potential new pathway that more VR studios could take: Convert their VR-only game into a non-VR, first-person experience that adds an influx of gamers but still supports their original fanbase.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PXCJwimXKZUhbBDwRhmD4a" name="Breachers-screenshot-official-Factory-gun-upgrade.jpg" alt="Official screenshots of Breachers on Meta Quest" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PXCJwimXKZUhbBDwRhmD4a.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Breachers VR on Quest </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Triangle Factory)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Many original Steam games have Steam VR ports, but these are secondary add-ons, and we've seen for years how PC VR is a niche platform for a few die-hard enthusiasts — not an especially profitable or popular one. Ideally, we'd see more Quest games that jump to Steam, with the largest VR and PC communities joining together.</p><p>Even if they're <em>better</em> in VR, multiplayer shooters like Contractors, Breachers, and Ghosts of Tabor would work on flat screens, too, and they'd launch with a dedicated user base so new Steam gamers would know they'd immediately have people to play with. Plus, VR gamers feeling too lazy to put on their headsets — or who notice their Quest 3 battery is dying — can keep the fun going on their gaming rigs.</p><p>Perhaps this kind of VR-to-traditional gaming transition is more difficult than we're making it sound; or perhaps these games' fanbases would balk at resources going to a new version they won't care about. But we still think this kind of strategy will give VR devs the resources they need to keep making great games despite a challenging sales climate, and that's a great thing in our books!</p>

<p>Google is continuing to alter the Assistant within its ever-changing ecosystem, and this latest move impacts audio devices.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/assistant/thread/326148532/google-assistant-spoken-notifications-change-on-headphones?hl=en&sjid=7078688767109123196-NA">community post</a>, the company drew attention to an upcoming change that will affect how users interact with the Google Assistant on headphones (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-assistant-earbuds-losing-tap-and-hold-notifications/">Android Police</a>). Google states the Assistant will soon lose the ability to read your notifications aloud when "pressed to activate."</p><p>In addition to this, the post states users will no longer be able to leverage the Assistant to reply to notifications, either.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/assistant/answer/7515695?hl=en">follow-up support</a> document expands on this, stating users will now have to manage the Assistant vocally. Instead of pressing a button, the Assistant will only respond to "Hey Google, read my notifications" moving forward.</p><p>Curiously, Google states it "will be" making this change to all headphones with Assistant as its virtual helper. However, the post fails to explicitly state when users can see this change go into effect. It'll be worth keeping an eye on things as we enter the final week of February.</p><p>It seems like we should brace for a future where we lose this ability on two of the best <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-headphones-support-google-assistant#section-best-over-ear">headphones with the Assistant</a>: the Bose QuietComfort Ultra and Sony's WH-1000XM5. We <em>could </em>say we're surprised by this development, but we saw <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/pixel-buds-pro-assistant-notifications-gone">the same thing happen</a> to earbuds with Google Assistant support in September. Things happened in reverse order as users took to Reddit to report the sudden jarring change to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-review">Pixel Buds Pro</a>.</p><p>Users were hit with a message stating, "touch and hold won't read notifications anymore." Similarly, they were told to say "Hey Google" aloud for those functions. It didn't sit well with users as they stated the touch-and-hold method was more private and convenient — but most of all <em>silent</em>.</p><p>Android Central reached out to Google at the time and the company stated it made the change "based on user feedback." It also confirmed that the change would stick, forcing users to have to speak aloud to the AI. The company reiterated a similar tune with its headphone announcement, meaning those users will lose out on the private touch-and-hold method.</p><p>It's also worth mentioning that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-review">Pixel Buds Pro 2</a> debuted in August with deep integration with Gemini, instead of the Assistant.</p>

<hr>
<p>Fitbit has been spotted pushing a light update to a few of its most recent smartwatches and trackers.</p><p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14236725#zippy=%2Ccharge">support page</a>, the wearable company is rolling out version 214.22 to the following devices: Charge 6, Sense 2, Versa 4, and the Inspire 3 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/20/fitbit-charge-6-sense-2-update/">9to5Google</a>). The latest patch brings enhanced "Bluetooth security" features to the Charge 6 and Inspire 3. Google states, after updating, users will be asked to "reconnect your device when prompted in the Fitbit app."</p><p>The other significant portion of this update concerns new "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14225687#Charge6_status_indicators&zippy=%2Ccharge">status indicators</a>."</p><p>All four wearables are receiving this small update today (Feb 20). The support document states these new status indicators will appear when users first wake up their watch's or tracker's clock face. Fitbit's update brings four icons, such as a DND sign and a crescent moon. The former indicates your wearable's Do Not Disturb mode is on while the latter regards "sleep mode."</p><p>Fitbit also added a red battery symbol, signaling your watch's power is severely low. The final symbol is a crossed-out phone, so users know their device has lost its Bluetooth connection with their handheld.</p><p>The company states the status indicators are optional. Users can head into their device's <strong>Settings app > Display > Status Indicators </strong>to toggle them on/off. Moreover, these indicators are not permanently on your display. They will display after a few seconds; however, you can "swipe right to check the icons at the top of quick settings."</p>

<p>Fitbit's devices have been left stagnant for a while as its most recent (major) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-update-features-modes-app-rollout">update came last July</a>. The update was spearheaded by Google as it inherited Fitbit's line of watches and trackers. The company plugged its machine learning into Fitbit's devices to improve its heart rate accuracy. The Inspire 3 received 20 new exercise modes last summer and other QoL (quality of life) enhancements.</p><p>The Sense 2 and Versa 2 finally gained a dedicated YouTube Music app a year after the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-charge-6-review">Charge 6</a> got it. Speaking of the latest tracker, the Charge 6 gained additional exercise modes similar to the Inspire 3.</p><p>Fitbit's latest update sings a better tune, especially after Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-sense-versa-3-battery-overheating-warning-reported">massive warning call</a> to Sense and Versa 3 owners about a dangerous battery issue. The devices were prone to extreme overheating issues, which could cause severe burns to the user's wrist if inflicted. Google started rolling out a software patch to correct the issue; however, owners of a device prone to overheating could've submitted a form for compensation.</p>

<hr>
<p>Android Auto users have been having bumpy starts to their car drives, thanks to a new update that may have messed up the connectivity between the two.</p><p>Many took to Google forums in the past few days stating that their Android Auto suddenly stopped working ( via<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/19/android-auto-wireless-broken-reports-13-5/#more-662203" target="_blank"> 9to5 Google)</a>. According to them, this issue could be due to the latest software update patch that came in at the end of January or early February that is causing the wireless connectivity to break.</p><p>Some users<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/androidauto/thread/323764003/wireless-android-auto-stopped-working-after-january-2025-update?hl=en&sjid=6661046456060814083-NA"> reported</a> the wireless connection failing once they updated to the latest version of the firmware, and Android Auto not being able to detect their device. But when the device is connected via USB, it seems to function as usual.</p><p>The patches in question are Android Auto v13.4 and v13.5, but we can't say for sure if this is what's causing the widespread issue. It could also be how some devices are interacting with the latest update. For now people with the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-switched-back-to-the-pixel-8-pro-and-i-couldnt-be-happier"> Pixel 8</a>, Samsung Galaxy S23 Plus, Galaxy S22 Ultra, Galaxy S20, with different car models seem to be facing this issue.</p><p>"After a year and a half, my 2023 Honda Civic no longer shows "Android Auto" for wireless. And when searching for my phone, the car screen says the car cannot find the Galaxy S20 phone.  It's been working mostly fine. And my phone's AA is recently updated," a user stated on the forum.</p><p>The people facing issues have tried all sorts of troubleshooting methods, but nothing seems to be fixing this issue. One user however noted that unless they restarted their phone each time, Android Auto didn't seem to connect.</p><p>We don't have any official guidelines from Google on how they plan to fix this issue. However, this isn't the first time an update has caused havoc for users, in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/androidauto/thread/279134372/android-auto-not-connecting-after-may-24th-update?hl=en" target="_blank">May last year users faced </a>a somewhat similar issue trying to connect their devices via USB and the app wouldn't recognize their devices. Users either had to reboot their phones or buy a different USB cable that sorted the issue out for them.</p><p>Google's spokesperson told Android Central in an email that they're aware of this issue and are currently investigating a fix for the same.</p><p>Despite said connectivity issues, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-auto-rolls-into-the-polestar-2-to-cover-some-gaps-in-android-automotive" target="_blank">Android Auto expanded its latest software </a>update for Polestar 2, P3.3.16, which came with HD radio and smoother low-speed driving, with wired Android Auto.

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Mobile World Congress (MWC) 2025 is just a few short weeks from now, and companies have already begun to tease what's in store for the big annual show. Honor just launched a pair of new phones so it looks like the company will be focusing on the software front for MWC this year, pushing forward with a new AI-focused concept it calls the Honor Alpha Plan.</p><p>Last year's launch of the Honor Magic 6 Pro came with a full commitment to leading with AI-forward features, particularly where <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-camera-review">the phone's camera</a> was concerned. At the time, the concept was still fairly new among phones, as Samsung had just announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> and most other AI-powered features baked into Android used AI before the term was in vogue.</p><p>The biggest issue with Honor's AI launch last year was compatibility with non-Honor devices and services. The rollout of Magic OS 9 alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Honor Magic 7 Pro</a> helped push that forward, with features like Magic Portal receiving support for hundreds of apps and a cool knuckle gesture that works a lot like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to search</a>. This builds on Google's function by making it easy to share things you circle, not just search for them.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="Xo3LehSv4dS9bfnN2u7baZ" name="honor-magic-portal-2025-demo" alt="Circling a paragraph with a finger knuckle and then immediately sharing it to X using Honor Magic Portal" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Xo3LehSv4dS9bfnN2u7baZ.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="281" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At MWC, we expect big things from the brand-new CEO of Honor, Jian Li, who just replaced previous CEO George Zhao in mid-January. No doubt, Li is looking to make his mark on the company as he sets the tone for the rest of the year, and the Honor Alpha Plan sounds exactly like what we might expect.</p><p>As you might imagine from the name, the word "Alpha" is the beginning of the Greek alphabet and likely a new path forward for the company's AI pursuits. Companies are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-plans-to-spend-billions-on-ai-2025">spending more on AI in 2025 than ever</a>, and the crown for the best AI in the land seems to change every week. It's not likely that Honor is going to jump into the fray with the likes of Open AI, Grok, Gemini, and Deepseek, but it certainly would make sense for the company to start launching more AI-forward devices in the future.</p><p>The question is whether that means adding more AI-enhanced features to its phones — like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-camera-review">brand-new AI telephoto feature</a> on the Magic 7 Pro — or if it means dedicated AI devices. One pioneer in this sector, the Humane AI Pin, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/humane-announces-its-departure-from-the-ai-scene-hp-acquires-it-for-usd116-million">just called it quits</a>. While the concept of a screenless device powered by an AI assistant is extremely futuristic, Humane's implementation of the concept left a lot to be desired.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wsNJPxcuJkAvo9xQFReWXZ" name="porsche-design-honor-magic-7-rsr-provence-04" alt="The back of the Provence PORSCHE DESIGN Honor Magic 7 RSR" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wsNJPxcuJkAvo9xQFReWXZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But I could easily see a company like Honor moving in to take advantage of the interest in this market by using its expertise on AI and device ecosystems. Honor already produces laptops, smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, and more that all link together in impressively cohesive ways.</p><p>I use an Honor MagicBook Art 14 Snapdragon Edition as my main laptop, and it pairs perfectly (and seamlessly) with the Honor Magic 7 RSR and two Honor tablets that I have. Using a tablet as a second laptop screen is as easy as hitting the "connect" button that pops up when the tablet is unlocked, and the same goes for bigger screen foldable phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review">Honor Magic V3</a>.</p><p>Most of the company's improvement happened throughout 2024, and 2025 looks to be the best year yet. Android Central Phones editor Harish Jonnalagadda wrote about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-is-innovating-its-way-to-the-top">Honor's impressive upward trajectory</a>, and I have no doubt the new CEO is aiming even higher with the Honor Alpha Plan when it's unveiled at MWC.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Da3vGi4zgjPAJKtajAPUHJ" name="honor-magic-v3-review-30.jpg" alt="Honor Magic V3 in semi-folded mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Da3vGi4zgjPAJKtajAPUHJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Jian Li comes from a Huawei background, at a time when the company led smartphone camera innovation before U.S. trade sanctions stymied the business for a few years. Now, Li has moved on to the helm of Honor and is clearly ready to take the company to the next level internationally.</p><p>While I could hope for a proper U.S. release of the company's products, I dare not hold my breath in the current political climate. Instead, I think the company will focus even more on unique AI features that are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-sharing-feature-magic-portal-3520837/">being copied by rivals</a> and dedicated AI-forward devices that will work well with all sorts of devices, not just Honor's.</p><p>After all, the Alpha Plan's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.honor.com/global/news/honor-alpha-plan-mwc2025/">currently laid-out vision</a> states that Honor "is committed to fostering an open and collaborative environment where innovation thrives through partnership." Given that the latest Honor devices work better than ever with Google's own Gemini services, it makes sense to me that Honor would push itself to be the leading international Android brand, especially since Samsung has been so stagnant in the past few years.</p>

<hr>
<p>After all the buzz surrounding a follow-up to the OPPO Find N3, the Chinese phone maker today officially pulled back the curtain on the Find N5. And its big claim to fame is being the world’s thinnest foldable yet.</p><p>OPPO’s latest book-style foldable pushes the limits of design, measuring just 8.92mm when folded and 4.21mm when open. Even with its sleek build, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">OPPO Find N5</a> packs a 6.62-inch cover display and a spacious 8.12-inch inner screen.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Fanz2BcmypJMCMbjNNavfL" name="OPPO-Find-N5" alt="OPPO Find N5 side view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Fanz2BcmypJMCMbjNNavfL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2400" height="1350" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OPPO)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Find N5 sticks to a familiar look with its bold circular camera module, flat edges, and curved corners, just like its predecessor. But OPPO has taken things up a notch, refining the design to make it even slimmer, barely edging out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review">Honor Magic V3</a>’s 9.0mm thickness.</p><p>Meanwhile, other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> are chunkier, tipping over 10mm when folded.</p><p>Beyond its remarkable thinness, the Find N5 is also the most water-resistant foldable yet, thanks to its IPX9 rating. While dust resistance is still missing, this marks a big step toward making foldables as tough as regular smartphones. OPPO also upgraded the titanium hinge, making the inner display’s crease far less noticeable than the competition.</p><p>Inside, the Find N5 is powered by the latest Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, paired with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. It runs on ColorOS 15.0.1, based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a>. And when it comes to battery life, it’s got you covered with a 5,600mAh, plus super-fast 80W wired charging and 50W wireless charging if you’re using AirVOOC.</p><p>The Find N5 sports a 6.62-inch OLED cover screen and a massive 8.12-inch OLED inner display, both packing a 120Hz refresh rate, HDR10+, Dolby Vision, and 2160Hz PWM dimming to cut down on flicker. And if you’re into stylus action, OPPO's Pen works with it—just don’t expect it to come in the box.</p>

<p>Teaming up with Hasselblad again, the Find N5 packs a solid camera setup: a 50MP main shooter with an f/1.56 aperture, an 8MP ultra-wide, and a 50MP telephoto lens for 3x optical zoom. Selfies and video calls are covered with 8MP front cameras on both the outer and inner displays.</p><p>The Find N5 is hitting shelves in plenty of European and Asian markets, starting at around $1,867. That said, don’t hold your breath for a U.S. release since OnePlus <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-says-it-will-not-be-launching-the-oneplus-open-2-this-year">already said no foldables are coming stateside this year</a>.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Foldables have come a long way in the last two years; the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review">Magic V3</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x-fold3-pro-review">X Fold3 Pro</a> combine great cameras with standout hardware package, and OPPO is looking to outmatch that with the Find N5. The foldable has the distinction of being the thinnest around, and at 4.21mm when unfolded, it is 0.14mm thinner than the Magic V3 — which I didn't think was possible. <br><br>While I didn't get to test the Find N3, I used the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-apex-edition-review">OnePlus Ope</a>n (which is just a rebrand of the N3) extensively, and the Find N5 builds on that foundation while delivering better cameras, brighter panels both inside and out, and a bigger battery. The ultra-thin design basically means that the Find N5 feels like a regular phone most of the time — it is just 0.4mm thicker than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> when folded — and it makes using the device an absolute delight. <br><br>It has a new hinge mechanism that uses titanium, and while that's undoubtedly a good thing, what I like about the change is that the crease is barely visible this time. That was the case on the Open too, but the Find N5 takes things to a whole new level, and honestly, I can say the same in a lot of other areas. The device even gets IPX9 ingress protection and a massive 5600mAh silicon battery that lasts more than any other foldable I used until now, and there's 50W AirVOOC alongside 80W charging. <br><br>The Find N5 isn't just a great foldable — it's one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> you can buy in 2025.</p>

<p>OPPO unveiled the Find N5 on February 20, and the foldable is set to go on sale in the coming weeks. It is available in a single configuration with 16GB of LPDDR5X RAM and 512GB of UFS 4.0 storage, and comes with ColorOS 15.0.1 based on Android 15.</p><p>The phone costs</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="XvocrkJ9NQrCe4fwFr3Pq4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XvocrkJ9NQrCe4fwFr3Pq4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Find N5 clearly builds on the design of its predecessor; it has a similar aesthetic with contoured edges and flat sides, and the in-hand feel is exquisite. But what I like the most is the ultra-sleek profile; the foldable is thin and light enough that it is just like using a regular phone when it's folded, and that is a huge deal. At 8.93mm, it is chunkier than the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a> and the Pixel 9 Pro XL, but not by much, and coming in at 229g, it doesn't weigh that much more either.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="opSz7tyQ2e4KtCvmfiKGv4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5 angled view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/opSz7tyQ2e4KtCvmfiKGv4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's when you unfold the Find N5 that you realize just how thin it really is; at just 4.21mm, the foldable is only a smidgen thicker than the width of the USB-C port, and that's incredible. I got a similar feeling when using the Magic V3, but where the Find N5 has an advantage over Honor's foldable is that the flat sides make it just that little bit better to hold and use. There's enough width along the sides to comfortably hold the device, and the 7000-series aluminum mid-frame adds decent rigidity to the overall structure.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="hW2c44Mu3Zy4UMEW6yx2b4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5 unfolded" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hW2c44Mu3Zy4UMEW6yx2b4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I would have liked a leather back like last time, but OPPO is using a fiber material on the Find N5 — ostensibly to save weight — and the silky texture makes it easier to hod the device. On the plus side, it doesn't pick up any smudges whatsoever, and I didn't feel the need to use a case with the foldable.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ViGgQy5BbGPHL8GGUuomd4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5 back view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ViGgQy5BbGPHL8GGUuomd4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The camera island is cleaner this time around, and the oversized module dominates attention at the back. Given the svelte profile of the foldable itself, the camera module protrudes quite a bit from the chassis, and there is a wobble when using the device while it's unfolded on a table — this isn't a problem when it's folded.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="uAWUoW2qnUZfK4B7kuxNj4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5 next to other foldables" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uAWUoW2qnUZfK4B7kuxNj4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Thankfully, the alert slider is intact, and it's located on the left. The volume and power buttons are on the right, and like most other foldables, the Find N5 uses a side-mounted sensor baked into the power button to unlock. It is fast and reliable, and I didn't see any issues in this regard.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="eKjWtvtti3KobiBqXecGi4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5 in Flex Mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eKjWtvtti3KobiBqXecGi4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Find N5 is available in two colors, and the white model is the one to get if you need a device that stands out visually. Interestingly, the foldable gets the distinction of being the only device in this category with IPX9 ingress protection in addition to IPX8, so it is able to withstand high pressure jets in addition to submersion in water. Like other foldables, there's no rating against dust ingress, but it has the usual seals and gaskets to ensure dust doesn't get into the hinge or any of the other moving parts.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qeZ42PWqbmP8JJeNUGv9b4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5 side view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qeZ42PWqbmP8JJeNUGv9b4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Talking about the hinge, the Find N5 uses a redesigned hinge mechanism that uses 3D printed parts and a titanium alloy, and it is 26% thinner than time while delivering 36% better durability. It's now called the Titanium Flexion Hinge, and it has a smooth articulation and doesn't take as much force to unlock.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="YPiJSfJtCbTfAkACDJ7rk4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5 next to other foldables" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YPiJSfJtCbTfAkACDJ7rk4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are two distinct advantages to the new hinge system: the Find N5 stays locked at any angle between 50 and 150 degrees, and that makes it much more versatile than the Magic V3. The best use case for this mode is to shoot photos in interesting angles with the camera, and it also has productivity benefits.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="yjbFdNzuYPQ7UrkiFnyhf4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5 next to Galaxy Z Fold 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yjbFdNzuYPQ7UrkiFnyhf4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But the biggest gain is the crease; the Find N5 still has a crease in the middle when it's unfolded, but it is nowhere as visible as other foldables. I didn't even notice it after a day of use, and it doesn't affect usability at all. The crease is so shallow that it makes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ill-admit-it-the-galaxy-z-fold-6-is-better-than-i-imagined">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> look outdated when using both foldables next to each other. <br><br>In fact, the design and svelte profile makes the Find N5 feel futuristic when you put it next to Samsung's foldable. So I guess it's a good thing from Samsung's point of view that this device isn't launching in the U.S.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="p3hjTAU3RjSKM9zDYmCss4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5 inner panel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p3hjTAU3RjSKM9zDYmCss4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>along with the 20.7:9 ratio means it feels like a regular phone, and honestly, I just used the outer panel most of the time. The outer display goes up to 1600 nits in outdoor use, and hits 2450 nits in HDR content. It has Dolby Vision and HDR10+, and color vibrancy is among the best of any foldable I've used. You get a good range of customizability as well, and I like the selection of always-on styles available within ColorOS.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="C67LiPiktwNTxXon7P8go4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5 YouTube video" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C67LiPiktwNTxXon7P8go4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The inner panel is noteworthy as it is a tablet-sized 8.12 inches — the biggest of any book-style foldable yet. Colors are fantastic, and the inner panel is ideally suited to view content or play games; I had a lot of fun with Balatro on this device. It goes up to 1400 nits in outdoor use, and 2100 nits when viewing HDR content, and there was never a scenario where I felt like it didn't get bright enough even under intense sunlight. While I didn't have OPPO's stylus (it isn't bundled in the package), you can use it with the foldable.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="EytDFasFyd4VchLPNgmWz4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5 with Balatro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EytDFasFyd4VchLPNgmWz4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both panels go up to 120Hz and leverage LTPO to dynamically adjust refresh on the fly, and the inner screen even gets an anti-reflective coating that makes a noticeable difference when using the device outdoors. Another advantage is that it has a dual shielded protective layer that leverages an elastomer material to deliver better resistance in the event of a tumble. The outer panel uses a custom Nanocrystal Glass, and it held up without any issues after taking two tumbles onto a tiled surface.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JAXQrtqActJZpt9hJUUMn4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5 selfie camera" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JAXQrtqActJZpt9hJUUMn4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You get loud stereo sound as well, and it makes a difference when viewing content on the inner panel. Basically, I didn't see any problems with the inner or outer screens, and OPPO did an incredible job in this area.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-oppo-find-n5-hardware"><span>OPPO Find N5: Hardware</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="jSHoK2nmz9gfGXTqvRxZh4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5 next to other foldables" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jSHoK2nmz9gfGXTqvRxZh4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Find N5 has the distinction of being the first foldable featuring the Snapdragon 8 Elite platform, but unlike the OnePlus 13, ASUS Zenfone 12 Ultra, and a multitude of phones that run Qualcomm's latest silicon, it's using seven cores instead of the standard eight. <br><br>The reasoning is that with you get better efficiency with a seven-core design, and honestly, there's no way of knowing in regular use that it is any different to other phones powered by the same platform. It is just as fluid in demanding tasks, and games run just as well. The only limitation is that it doesn't quite have the same thermal thresholds, so you see some throttling earlier than usual — that is the case with all devices in this category, so it isn't unique to the Find N5.</p>

<p>Even then, I didn't see any issues getting stable framerates in visually-demanding games. In fact, the only way to see that the foldable is using a non-standard option of Qualcomm's silicon is via synthetic workloads; the Find N5 didn't get quite as high a score in Geekbench's multi-core tests, but it doesn't make a noticeable difference in real-world use. It hit a stability score of 55.9% in 3DMark's Steel Nomad stress test is 55.9%, and went up to 48 degrees. While that is hotter than other foldables, it was localized to the middle, and it didn't feel uncomfortable to hold at the sides <br><br>The foldable is sold in a single 16GB/512GB configuration, and it doesn't miss out when it comes to connectivity. I didn't see any issues while making calls or with cellular connectivity in general. If anything, the foldable had better connectivity than most other devices I tested recently, and that's likely due to the 360-degree antenna design. <br><br>In a similar vein, the vibration motor is pretty good; it doesn't deliver the granular feedback that you get on the Find X8 Pro, but it is one of the better options I've used on a foldable. <br><br>There really isn't anything missing on the Find N5; even though it is using a modified Qualcomm chipset, you just don't notice that in regular use, and that alone illustrates just how powerful mobile platforms are getting.</p>

<p>The Find N5 lasts longer than any other foldable I tested until now. Even though it's thinner than other foldables, there's a massive 5600mAh battery under the hood, and it easily lasts a day even with heavy use. I've had the phone for a week now, and there was never a point where I had to worry about the battery running out before the end of the day — even during a week where I was basically travelling most of the time. <br><br>Like most other 2025 phones, the Find N5 is using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/most-android-flagships-are-getting-an-exciting-battery-upgrade-in-2025">silicon battery tech</a> to great effect, delivering much better density and longevity than previous years. It uses 10% silicon in the anode, and OPPO says the battery is 30% thinner than what's used in most foldables because of the inclusion of silicon — it's thinner than the 4800mAh battery in the N3. <br><br>There's even 80W charging, and it takes just over 47 minutes to fully charge. The best part is that the device gets 50W AirVOOC wireless charging, and although I didn't have OPPO's charging puck, it should work just as well with the OnePlus AirVOOC magnetic charger that debuted alongside the OnePlus 13. The only caveat is that just like the OnePlus 13, you'll need to use a magnetic case to take advantage of the AirVOOC tech. <br><br>The convenience of AirVOOC along with the standard 80W charging means you don't really need to plug in the Find N5 overnight, and I'm just glad that we are getting to a point where foldables last as long as regular phones.</p>

<p>OPPO knows how to deliver a strong camera package, and there's a lot to like on the Find N5. The foldable gets a 50MP Sony Lytia LYT700 main camera; this is the same sensor that's used to great effect in the Find X8. It's joined by a 50MP Samsung JN5 telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom, and an 8MP wide-angle lens with autofocus. <br><br>Both the main camera and telephoto modules have OIS, and you get an 8MP camera tucked inside both the inner and outer panels. Interestingly, you can use the tele lens to shoot macros, and it does a good job in this regard. There's 4K60 10-bit HDR video as well, but it's limited to the main and zoom lenses — the wide-angle only goes up to 4K30. Hasselblad integration is intact, and you get orange accents in the interface and the distinctive leaf shutter sound. <br><br>There's also a Hasselblad Master mode that's basically a manual mode, and you get the usual set of shooting modes and filters that debuted on the Find X8. The camera interface itself hasn't changed, but because the Find N5 is a foldable, you can use FlexForm mode to good effect and take photos in interesting angles. On that note, you can use the viewfinder with the outer panel, giving you the ability to take selfies with the rear cameras, and this is what I did most of the time — I just used the selfie cameras when making video calls. <br><br>You get the same set of AI editing features as the Find X8, including an unblur option that does a good job restoring details, and a fantastic eraser mode that's among the best you get on any Android device.</p>

<p>Thanks to the LYT700 imaging module and latest-gen Hasselblad camera tuning, the Find N5 takes outstanding photos in daylight scenarios. You get good dynamic range and white balance, and colors look natural; there isn't too much saturation. <br><br>Foliage is rendered accurately, and there isn't any issue with aggressive smoothing. Macros came out really well too, and this is an area where the Find N5 does a better job than just about every other foldable. The wide-angle lens is the weakest sensor at the back, but it still does a decent job in most situations, even if you don't get the same color vibrancy in low-light. <br><br>On that note, the main camera takes outstanding photos in challenging conditions. It preserves intricate details and minimizes highlights, and there isn't any visible noise. The tele lens is really good as well, and you get the same caliber of shots as the main camera at 3x.</p>

<p>There is a noticeable difference in detail retrieval at 6x, but you still get great shots, and the phone uses AI to smooth out images beyond 10x, delivering passable shots at up to 30x. The phone does a great job with portrait shots, but there are situations where you get excessive blooming in the background; this was a problem on the Find X8 Pro when it debuted, but a software update sorted out those issues — I believe that will be the case on this device as well. <br><br>I still think the Find X8 Pro and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a> have an edge in low-light, but the Find N5 has every other foldable beat when it comes to the cameras. If anything, the cameras on the Find N5 are better than the Galaxy S25 and Pixel 9, and that's a big deal in and of itself.</p>

<p>The Find N5 runs ColorOS 15.1 based on Android 15, and having used the Find X8 and Find X8 Pro quite a bit in the last four months, the software felt familiar. ColorOS 15 has a new interface with vivid colors, and it bundles a decent set of AI utilities; the Find N5 has a nifty call summarization and instant translation feature, but they'll be rolling out at the end of Q1. <br><br>Multitasking is a pretty big use case on a foldable, and OPPO's Boundless View is back on the Find N5. The mode makes it extremely easy to set up a split-screen pair and multitask on the device, and I want other manufacturers to borrow this mode as soon as possible.</p>

<p>What's new this time is split-screen suggestions; if you're switching between two apps in unfolded mode, ColorOS 15 suggests creating a split-screen mode instead, and it's intuitive. You can also save these split-screen pairs on the home screen if you need quick access. <br><br>Other foldable mainstays like an app dock and taskbar are intact, and while the notification pane now defaults to a split option with the toggles to one side and notifications on the other, you can switch back to a unified option if that's what you like (as I do). <br><br>The Find N5 is optimized incredibly well, and the foldable has a fluidity that you just don't get with many devices in this category. I didn't see any slowdowns whatsoever, and most of the time, I didn't even realize I was using a foldable.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vCMDvCbBo9qGhPSvUfpVo4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5 drawer on the taskbar" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vCMDvCbBo9qGhPSvUfpVo4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I have two issues with the software; the app grid is still limited to 4x4, and I just don't understand why that's the case. Every other Android phone I use has the ability to switch to a 5x5 grid, and not being able to do that on the Find N5 is annoying. The second is that there's still plenty of bloatware on the device, and while it can be easily uninstalled, I don't want to see any bloatware on a phone that costs this much.<br> <br>With the Find X8, OPPO introduced the ability to share content with iPhone uses via O+ Connect, and it's extending that feature to macOS with the Find N5. You'll need to install O+ Connect on your MacBook, and you can easily transfer content to and from the Find N5, view photos on the MacBook, and even control your MacBook using the foldable.</p>

<p>When it comes to software updates, the Find N5 will pick up five Android platform updates alongside six years of security updates, and that's better than most foldables. OPPO is doing a good job rolling out updates on time, and the device should make the switch to Android 16 shortly after it becomes available in Q2 2025.</p>

<p>Honor's Magic V3 is the closest rival to the Find N5. It also has a svelte design, great hardware, and an outstanding camera package. It may not be as powerful, but there are no problems gaming on the device, and Honor leads the industry when it comes to eye comfort tech. Having used both devices, I think the Find N5 has a slender edge with the design and cameras, and I generally prefer using ColorOS to MagicOS. That said, these are minor differences, and both foldables are among the best around. <br><br>There isn't anywhere as much of a choice if you're in North America. While I like the design and software of the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, the cameras just don't hold up in 2025, and it isn't as comfortable to hold and use. The only other option is the Galaxy Z Fold 6, but that's hilariously outdated next to the Find N5, and I honestly wouldn't recommend the device.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-oppo-find-n5-should-you-buy-it"><span>OPPO Find N5: Should you buy it?</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LeLXWHdSnfmDEMxacnSXt4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5 next to other foldables" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LeLXWHdSnfmDEMxacnSXt4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You should buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a foldable that feels like a regular phone</li><li>You want a foldable without a visible crease</li><li>You need the latest internals and the best cameras</li><li>You need standout battery life</li><li>You want reliable ingress protection</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You're in North America</li><li>You need a clean software interface</li></ul>
<p>One of the main reasons why I like the Find N5 so much is that it doesn't feel like a foldable. When interacting with the outer panel, I felt like I was using a regular phone, but I still have the versatility of unfolding the device and accessing a tablet-sized panel. That is a big deal, and while Vivo and Honor also have ultra-thin foldables, I think OPPO did a better job overall. <br><br>Both the inner and outer displays deliver outstanding color fidelity and contrast levels, and I didn't see any issues in this regard. The unbelievably-thin design makes using the inner panel that much more enjoyable, and while I was worried about the durability of the device in the beginning — it is the thinnest foldable, after all — it hasn't been a problem. <br><br>It is just as fast as a regular phone, and it holds up very well even during extended gaming sessions. Similarly, the battery life is outstanding, and it outmatches every other foldable I've used up to this point — even with heavy use, I easily got a day's worth of battery. <br><br>The cameras are the best of any foldable yet, and you get a good amount of versatility as well, which isn't always the case. The software is packed with useful features too, and OPPO managed to find a nice balance with its AI suite. <br><br>In fact, my only annoyance with the device is with its positioning. With OPPO taking the lead this time, the Find N5 won't be available in as many global regions, and it isn't coming to North America. That's a real shame, because the Find N5 is a fantastic showcase for what's possible with foldables, and it effortlessly outshines what Samsung is doing. If you're in a country where the Find N5 is going on sale and are interested in switching to a foldable, you should consider picking it up — this is the best foldable I've ever used.</p>

<p>MWC 2025 is coming up fast and TECNO is highlighting what users can expect from its software and smartphones.</p><p>To start, the company's press release states that TECNO had taken strides to "advance" how the multitude of human skin tones appear on its cameras/photos. Achieving this pushed TECNO to expand its "Skin Tone Database" to accomplish "true-to-life representation." Its devices will utilize a new, expanded Multi Skin Tone Color Card, packed full with over 372 color patches.</p><p>These patches facilitate "inclusivity" as they reportedly reflect skin tones in Southeast Asia, South Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe. TECNO has also taken steps to create a "region-specific" 186-patch color card for people in Saudi Arabia.</p><p>These color cards are step one of TECNO's goal of displaying skin tones appropriately. Backing this up is the company's "skin tone restoration engine." Packaged within its Universal Tone engine, TECNO says its software will ensure human skin tones are "precise" through "color calibrations." Regarding exposure, TECNO states it will ensure the appropriate adjustments are made to keep everyone's skin vibrant and consistent, even in "challenging scenarios," such as your background.</p><p>TECNO teases attendees will see a demo of its enhanced color card for mobile imaging during MWC 2025.</p>

<p>The other side of its MWC 2025 announcement is a teaser for new TECNO AI systems. The company states it is preparing to unveil a new AI-powered intelligent product ecosystem. TECNO is reportedly interested in developing and producing more "practical AI" as it looks to tackle the interest of global markets. To achieve this, TECNO has teased a new product launch for its CAMON series of smartphones.</p><p>The press release adds that TECNO is also "likely" preparing to debut a pair of AI glasses and a new laptop, which could join its MEGABOOK series.</p><p>The Chinese OEM teases the possibility of MWC Barcelona attendees witnessing the prototype for its upcoming "ultra-thin" Phantom Ultimate 2 tri-fold. At the moment, nothing is definite; however, TECNO states there's a chance it could have the tri-fold prototype available on the floor for people to see for themselves.</p><p>Another early reveal could involve TECNO's Starry Optical Fiber material. Details state this material incorporates "ultra-fine optical fibers" with mini-LEDs to create a sparkling effect.</p><p>MWC 2025 will happen in Barcelona, Spain from March 3 to March 6.</p>

<p>The idea of a more "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/tecno-ai-foldable-strategy-interview">practical AI</a>' from TECNO was discussed last year when it was present at IFA 2024. The company launched its AI assistant, Ella, which had been upgraded with new capabilities thanks to Google's Gemini. Ella can conduct an AI search, deliver real-time analysis, and more. However, during an interview with Android Central, TECNO stated Ella has over 600 system-wide functions to aid users.</p><p>The OEM also touts Ella's ability to help bridge the language gap as it features more local languages, aiding its usage in more countries.</p><p>What's more, TECNO <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-phantom-ultimate-2-reveal">originally teased</a> the Phantom Ultimate 2 tri-fold in 2024, but users didn't get to see it up close. The concept was highlighted in videos and imagery, stating it would feature a 6.48-inch cover display and a 10-inch 3K OLED panel internally. The company also showcased the phone's ability to be used in a unique 1/3 setup, meaning one portion of its three screens can remain on a table as a keyboard.</p>

If you’re all about karaoke nights, you’ll love this update.</p><p>You'll see three options when tapping the button: Artwork, Lyrics, and Video. Pick "Artwork," and you’ll see the album cover front and center, set against a background that matches its main color, with the artist and song details right below. Go for "Lyrics," and the album art shifts to the side while live, synced-up lyrics take the spotlight.</p><p>The new feature is rolling out on YouTube for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-tv">Android TV</a> (version 5.22 and up) and is also popping up on other smart TV platforms</p><p>This option has some useful potential, but it’s not without its quirks. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/youtube-android-tv-lyrics-3527564/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> dug into it and found a few headaches, like the app struggling to remember your preferences.</p><p>It might save settings for a single video, but more often than not, it snaps back to the default video view. And forget about keeping those settings consistent across multiple videos—it’s hit or miss.</p><p>On top of that, there’s a noticeable drop in sound quality when you switch to Artwork or Lyrics modes, probably because it pulls audio from YouTube Music instead of the original video. So, while it’s a neat addition, there’s still some fine-tuning needed.</p><p>YouTube’s new “Display” feature on Android TV feels like a nod to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music">YouTube Music</a>’s earlier experiments with live lyrics during casting. Back in late 2022, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-music-tests-ui-live-lyrics">YouTube Music rolled out a revamped casting interface</a> that brought scrolling lyrics, album art, and track details to the forefront, all set against a blurred album art background.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-47">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Sony’s latest mid-ranger is finally making the jump to Android 15, keeping up with its promise of three major OS updates.</li><li>The update (build 70.1.A.0.425) is under 1GB, though Sony hasn’t shared a detailed changelog.</li><li>Expect Private Space, UI tweaks, Bluetooth LE Audio broadcasting, pop-up windows, and more.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The Sony Xperia 10 VI is now getting the much-awaited Android 15 update, adding it to the list of Sony phones that have already made the leap to the new OS.</p><p>Sony's newest mid-range phone <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/sony-xperia-10-vi-goes-official">launched in June of last year running Android 14</a>. A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SonyXperia/comments/1irpnn8/xperia_10_vi_android_15/" target="_blank">Reddit user</a> has spotted that it's now making the switch to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/sony_xperia_10_vi_receiving_android_15_update-news-66601.php" target="_blank">GSMArena</a>). This reaffirms that Sony is keeping its word on delivering three major Android upgrades for this device.</p><p>The Xperia 10 VI’s Android 15 update is rolling out with the build number 70.1.A.0.425, and it’s a lightweight download at under 1GB. Sony hasn’t dropped a detailed changelog, but chances are it’s packing the same goodies as other Xperia models that already made the jump to Android 15.</p><p>Sony has now brought Android 15 to five Xperia phones since last year, with the Xperia 10 VI being the latest. Even with a smaller lineup, Sony stays committed to keeping its devices up to date. Meanwhile, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-delayed-february-issues-reported">Samsung is dragging its feet</a> on pushing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a> to its older flagship phones.</p><p>The Xperia 10 VI’s Android 15 update packs a bunch of features that other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-sony-phones">Sony phones</a> have already been enjoying. You’ll get Private Space for tighter security, updated Wallpaper & Style choices, tweaks to Side Sense, a revamped Quick settings panel, Bluetooth LE Audio broadcasting, handy pop-up windows, and some SIM setting adjustments.</p><p>All the details about the Android 15 update for the Xperia 10 VI are now live on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://helpguide.sony.net/mobile/xperia-10m6/v1/en/contents/changes_update_software_android_15.html" target="_blank">support page</a>.</p><p>The Xperia 10 VI’s latest OS update is rolling out just three weeks after the Xperia 10 V got its turn. It’s a bit surprising, though, since the 10 VI is the newer model—you’d think it would’ve been first in line. Either way, both phones are now on board with the latest software.</p><p>These phones are set to get Android 16 and maybe even Android 17. Sony is also keeping the security patches coming for years.</p>

<hr>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-hands-on">OnePlus Watch 3 launched yesterday</a> and while we're still soaking in all the new features, one user on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oneplus/comments/1iswu8a/oneplus_watch_3_meda_in_china_misspelled_on_the/?utm_source=embedv2&utm_medium=post_embed&utm_content=post_body&embed_host_url=https://www.androidpolice.com/oneplus-watch-3-typo/">Reddit</a> has noticed a minor error with the wearable.</p><p>It has nothing to do with the Watch 3 itself, but with a typo on the back panel. The company ended up engraving "Meda in China" instead of "Made in China," on these wearables (first reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-watch-3-typo-mistake-3527878/">Android Authority</a>). While this may seem like a minor issue, it raises questions about how the Watch 3 cleared final quality checks.</p><p>While not many people have been able to get their hands on this wearable as official sales don't begin until February 25, the first few who did receive this batch seemed to have got the ones with the typo. This includes Android Central's Nick Sutrich, who also received the watch from the typo- batch.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="PiXUZsMx4VkE2aXvovm6nk" name="Typo-OnePlus-Watch3" alt="Meda in China on the OnePlus Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PiXUZsMx4VkE2aXvovm6nk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="3072" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Nick's OnePlus Watch 3 review unit, showing the typo </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Reddit thread showcased mixed reactions from users. Some made fun of this odd situation, while others expressed their disappointment with the company's oversight and attention to detail.</p><p>What's more, Android Authority noted this same typo on Watch 3 renders located on OnePlus's website. The site suggested this typo might somehow be intentional, though a simpler alternative is that the error has been copy-pasted in multiple places.</p><p>OnePlus has yet to comment on this mistake. Android Central has reached out to them to check if this typo will be corrected on the other watches that will soon be on sale. We will update this article once we have more information.</p><p>Typo aside, the OnePlus Watch 3 has mostly attracted positive attention this week thanks to its powerful five-day battery life, backed by the same OnePlus Silicon NanoStack Battery as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>, and several <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-vs-watch-2">key upgrades over the Watch 2</a>. But we did also note that the Watch 3's software <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-has-set-interesting-standard-with-wear-os-5-and-oneplus-watch-3">updates will be slower and fewer</a> than the Galaxy and Pixel Watches; this should have a more lasting impact than a typo that'll be hidden by your wrist.</p>

<ul><li>Live Captions and Live Translate will now have a 30-minute visibility window, making it easier to go back and read what you missed.</li><li>The transcript of the last 30 minutes of a call will appear as scrollable text for easy catch-ups.</li><li>The feature is starting to roll out now for Google Meet for paid and personal Google Workspace accounts.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Live Captions and Live Translate in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-meet-fresh-ui-makeover-update">Google Meet</a> are gaining a neat feature that'll make it easier to catch up or revisit missed conversations, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/02/google-meet-caption-history.html" target="_blank">announced</a> in a Workspace Blog post Tuesday, Feb. 18. Previously, the transcripts for Live Captions and Translate only briefly remained on the screen as the conversation continued. Now, Google will keep record of the call's transcript for 30 minutes.</p><p>The old behavior for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-use-googles-live-translate-feature">Live Captions and Translate</a> in Meet had translations or captions disappear when they were "no longer relevant to the current conversation," the company says. While the captions and translations appeared in real-time, as their names' suggest, they might not have remained on the screen long enough for everyone. That's why Google is making the transcripts available for 30 minutes after the captions or translations appear.</p><p>"This update makes it possible to scroll back and review the last 30 minutes of captions at your own pace," Google explains. "This can be particularly helpful if you’ve missed a portion of the conversation or you want to review specific details mentioned earlier in the conversation."</p><p>The captions are scrollable, so users can go as far back as they need to (within the half-hour window) while continuing the call with the current speakers still visible. After a user has caught up, they can click a "Jump to the bottom" button to return to the real-time translations or captions.</p>

<p>To use this feature, you'll have to have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-enable-captions-google-duo-and-google-meet-your-android-phone">Live Captions or Live Translate turned on for the call</a>. Once you're in a call, find the Turn on Captions button with the closed-captioning logo beside it. Depending on your platform, this might be hidden behind a three-button menu. Luckily, the scrollable captions are available for both <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">paid and personal Google Workspace accounts</a> — meaning anyone can use them.</p><p>The updates to Live Captions and Live Translate are rolling out now, and users on rapid release Workspace domains should see them in a few days. For people on scheduled release domains, the rollout will begin Feb. 24 and could take up to 15 days to appear.</p>

<p>Humane announced in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.humane.com/hc/en-us/articles/34374173951373-Important-Update-for-Consumer-Ai-Pin-Customers">post</a> on Feb. 18 that it will officially be shutting down and moving on from the AI scene as its "business priorities have shifted." The company was looking for a buyer after seeing a massive dip in sales <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wearable-ai-brand-humane-looking-to-sell-sources-say">in May last year</a>. Now it looks like HP went ahead and acquired them for $116 million.</p><p>Humane's AI pin was a unique device created by two ex-Apple designers in 2018. It had an AI voice assistant, camera, speaker, and laser projector all built into the device. Now, according to the company's FAQ page, these $700 pins will be bricked and will “no longer connect to Humane’s servers,” after Feb. 28, at noon PT.</p><p>Following that, “all customer data, including personally identifiable information will be permanently deleted from Humane’s servers.” The company added that it has stopped selling AI pins and canceled orders that have not been fulfilled. Humane will now be selling all of its assets including the pin's operating software CosmOS, 300 patents, and patent applications, to HP by the end of this month (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/truly-a-middle-finger-humane-bricking-700-ai-pins-with-limited-refunds/">Arstechnica</a>).</p><p>"Humane’s AI platform Cosmos, backed by an incredible group of engineers, will help us create an intelligent ecosystem across all HP devices from AI PCs to smart printers and connected conference rooms. This will unlock new levels of functionality for our customers and deliver on the promises of AI," <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://humane.com/media/humane-hp" target="_blank">said</a> Tuan Tran, president of technology and innovation at HP.</p>
<p>Android Central's Andrew Myrick saw it coming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-current-problem-with-tech-ai-devices-why-its-your-fault">quite early</a>, predicting that "it could end up being a bigger flop than <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/phones/windows-phone/what-would-microsofts-windows-phone-look-like-in-2024-its-like-a-micro-pc-running-windows-12-in-your-pocket" target="_blank">Windows Phone</a> or LG's smartphone business." Why, he argued, would enough people spend that amount on an AI pin when you could get a better-looking gadget like a smartwatch that does everything this pin would?</p><p>Still, many early adopters <em>didn't</em> see this coming. Customers who bought the AI pin were left furious as the company stated that they wouldn't be getting a refund if their device wasn't within the 90-day return window. Humane's FAQ page stated that "all device shipments before November 15th, 2024, are not eligible for refunds. All refunds must be submitted by February 27th, 2025.”</p><p>In a Reddit <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/humane/comments/1isq5rx/what_in_the_entire_f_not_happy_at_all_feel_like/">thread</a>, a user wrote that they felt duped considering the device will now effectively act as a paperweight. Some said that they liked the device and were waiting to get updates that would improve the overall performance of the pin.</p><p>"Cancelled my account last month. Being an early adopter means that you get to experience the latest tech, and sometimes you lose like this. No regrets," a user added.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I, for one, will miss Humane. For all it got wrong, it was a bold stab at what gadgets might lie beyond the smartphone.

<p>Other early Humane adopters suggested that this pin should've been sold as a phone accessory, rather than an expensive standalone device.</p><p>Unfortunately for these Humane pin buyers, there's nothing left for them to do except back up any stored pictures, videos, and notes from .Center before the Feb. 28 deadline.</p>

<ul><li>Google is bringing a similar feature to Circle to Search to iOS for the first time.</li><li>Search Screen with Google Lens lets you search anything in the Chrome or Google apps for iOS, with AI Overviews in tow.</li><li>This feature won't fully match Circle to Search, but it is coming to Android as well.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is bringing a similar feature to Circle to Search to the Chrome and Google Search apps for iOS. The company announced in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/google-lens/lens-on-ios-ai-overviews/" target="_blank">blog post</a> today, Feb. 19, that it's updating Google Lens in the Chrome and Search apps for iOS to let users "select and search what’s on your screen." Since the feature supports "drawing, highlighting or tapping" and doesn't require taking a screenshot, it's eerily similar to how Circle to Search works on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>.</p><p>Of course, unlike Circle to Search, the updates to Google Lens won't be available throughout iOS. That simply isn't possible due to the restrictions Apple has in place for third-party iPhone apps. However, Android Central tried the new Google Lens functionality in the Chrome and Google apps for iPhone — and it's quite similar in feel to Circle to Search. That is, provided you want to look up something you saw on the web and not, say, a social media app.</p><p>The way it works is simple. After finding something in Chrome or the Google Search apps you want to search, tap the three-dot menu in the toolbar and press <strong>Search Screen with Google Lens</strong>. It's all the way at the bottom, so you'll have to scroll for it. From there, tap, draw, or highlight something on your screen to search it. Depending on the query, you might get an AI Overview summarizing the response.</p><p>Google says that the update is rolling out starting now for "English-language users in countries where AI Overviews are available." The company adds that Search Screen with Google Lens will hit the Google app for Android and iOS first, with the Chrome desktop and mobile apps to follow. With that being said, Android Central was able to test this feature on both the Chrome and Google apps for iOS immediately on an iPhone 16 Pro running iOS 18.</p>

<p>It sounds like this functionality will make its way to the Chrome and Google apps for Android, too — even if it's a bit redundant on devices with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>. It's not the first time Google has slowly brought Android exclusive AI features to iOS, though. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-live-android-auto-chat-summary-brief-spotted">Gemini Live</a>, a conversational and natural voice-first AI interface, started on Android before making its way to iOS.</p><p>For now, Search Screen with Google Lens is a bit difficult to reach in the Chrome for iOS app. However, the company plans to eventually add a Lens icon in the address bar for quick access to the feature in the future.</p>

<ul><li>OnePlus announced that its latest flagship phone will now feature a night mode setting on Instagram.</li><li>This tool is known for capturing images/videos in low light settings and will be built into the in-app camera.</li><li>Users are urged to test out the moon icon when it pops up on Instagram.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>In a community post, OnePlus <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1798899690201153539" target="_blank">announced</a> that its newest flagship device the OnePlus 13's Night Mode feature will be integrated to optimize photos taken on Instagram.</p><p>It is a known fact that with some devices, Instagram's in-built camera reduces the quality of the images captured, and adding additional effects could further compromise the quality. That said, when using social media apps such as Instagram it's an added task to be switching between the phone's camera and the app to put out a photo.</p><p>However, with its latest update, the company says it has heard its users "loud and clear." OnePlus said it has now teamed up with Instagram to enable users to better capture those dark sky/cozy dinner shots easily. This feature will be built directly into the in-app and will be seen as a 'crescent moon' icon. The app will detect that the user is in a low light setting and will prompt them to use the Night mode. The mode once turned on, will use multi-frame processing to brighten shots and reduce noise in the said image. All without ripping out the quality from these shots.</p>

<p>It looks like OnePlus is building on something that began with other Android phones in December 2024. A similar moon icon showed up on devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-vs-pixel-9-pro">Pixel 9 </a>and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-ultra-one-month-later">Samsung Galaxy S24 </a>last year, enabling them to capture better low-light images, with the help of Camera Extensions API (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2024/12/instagram-on-android-low-light-photos.html?utm_source=syndication" target="_blank">Android Developers Blog</a>). The feature is also available to users with any Pixel device from the Pixel 6 series and up, Samsung Flip 6 or Fold 6, and will be expanded to more devices in the future.</p><p><strong>Here’s how it works for OnePlus 13 users:</strong></p>
<ul><li>Open Instagram’s camera</li><li>When the scene gets dim, Night Mode kicks in <strong>automatically, </strong>look for the moon icon 🌙 at the top.</li><li>Tap the shutter, hold steady for a few seconds, and the app then shoots an image in Night mode.</li></ul>
<p>It is important to note that users need to have the latest Instagram version installed on their devices for this feature to show up. However, it remains unclear when or if this feature will show up in previous-generation OnePlus devices.</p><p>Android Central has reached out to OnePlus about this and will update the article once we have more information.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Apple just announced the iPhone 16e, providing a much-needed upgrade over the incredibly outdated iPhone SE. While the 16e is more expensive than the phone it's replacing, it's still much cheaper than the Galaxy S25 and Pixel 9. All while managing to provide about 90% of the same experience that you would get with the standard iPhone 16.</p><p>Normally, I don't pay close attention to when Apple or Samsung release these cheaper alternatives. The cost-cutting measures that are taken usually make for phones that just aren't all that appealing. However, the iPhone 16e is the first time that I've taken a second look at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-debuts-iphone-16e-a-powerful-new-member-of-the-iphone-16-family/">press release</a>.</p><p>For one, Apple has finally ditched the Home Button and rounded frame for good, providing a budget option that actually looks modern. Sure, we sacrificed the Home Button for the notch, but hey, beggars can't be choosers.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1120px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AHGz9BYP7932QkqQcEJJaE" name="iphone-16e-side-view-render" alt="iPhone 16e side profile render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AHGz9BYP7932QkqQcEJJaE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1120" height="630" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We also have all of the expected differences, such as the iPhone 16e only being equipped with a single wide-angle rear camera, limited to a 2x optical zoom. MagSafe isn't built-in, but give <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phones">case makers</a> a few weeks and that problem will swiftly be remedied. However, we can't help but wonder why Apple wouldn't include MagSafe on a phone that shares the design as the one that introduced it.</p><p>What I wasn't expecting was for the iPhone 16e to be able to take full advantage of Apple Intelligence. This includes the addition of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-made-the-right-decision-to-ditch-the-mute-switch-on-the-iphone-15-pro">Action Button</a>, allowing you to ask ChatGPT about life's most important questions. Or, I don't know, point the phone at something, hit the Action Button, and enjoy Apple's version of Google Lens.</p><p>All of this is made possible thanks to Apple's A18 processor, which is another obvious inclusion with the iPhone 16e. However, when looking at Apple's "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apple.com/iphone/compare/?modelList=iphone-16e,iphone-16,iphone-16-pro-max" target="_blank">Compare iPhone Models</a>" page, there's one (seemingly) tiny difference as the 16e is using a "binned" version of the A18.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="t5si5YMrmbX7vSmrEHpFSd" name="apple-a18-graphic" alt="Apple A18 chip graphic" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/t5si5YMrmbX7vSmrEHpFSd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Instead of having a 6-core CPU paired with a 5-core GPU like the iPhone 16, the A18 in the 16e "only" includes a 4-core GPU. This isn't anything ground-breaking, as companies have been doing this for years, including Apple.</p><p>What makes it interesting is that this is the cheapest phone that has built-in AI capabilities. Both <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-tested-samsung-galaxy-s25-google-pixel-9">Google's Pixel 9 and Samsung's Galaxy S25</a> retail for $799, while the iPhone 16e comes in at just $599. And yes, I know there are cheaper phones out there and you can just download Gemini, ChatGPT, Claude, or whatever other AI app.</p><p>The difference is that Apple Intelligence isn't just the ChatGPT integration with Siri. Apple is also bringing its other AI features to its cheapest iPhone, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/revisiting-apple-clean-up-vs-google-magic-eraser">Clean Up for photos</a>, Image Playground for AI-generated images, and more. That's built-in integration that you just won't find on any of the alternatives. Well, at least not yet.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ayQP3ZsBLgHmA53vvnTezQ" name="iphone-16e-visual-intelligence-response" alt="Visual Intelligence response on iPhone 16e" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ayQP3ZsBLgHmA53vvnTezQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-major-specs-render-design-changes-leaked">Google's Pixel 9a</a> could be right around the corner, with recent rumors pointing to a mid-March launch. It's expected to simply be a cheaper version of the Pixel 9, powered by the Tensor G4 and the 9a is apparently set to share the same RAM and storage configurations.</p><p>Meanwhile, we don't know if Samsung is planning to release a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/sasmung-galaxy-s25-fe-could-be-called-s25-slim">Galaxy S25 FE</a>, although it would come as a bit of a surprise if it doesn't. As we've seen with the Galaxy S24 FE and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10">Tab S10</a> series, Samsung isn't afraid of using a MediaTek chip. Meaning that it wouldn't be completely on par with its flagship brethren, as the S25 relies on Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite.</p><p>That being said, Samsung proved that it could still provide an excellent AI experience even with the switch to MediaTek. Rumors are already suggesting that the S25 FE could be powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediateks-dimensity-9400-is-the-biggest-challenger-to-qualcomm-yet">Dimensity 9400</a>. Which, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-vs-mediatek-dimensity-9400-vs-google-tensor-g4" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">based on our recent comparison</a>, might not be the flagship equivalent of Qualcomm that we were hoping for.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1415px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.83%;"><img id="Ri5t9SatZcsjr9hhZCJW7X" name="google-pixel-9a-alleged-renderings-leaning.jpg" alt="A supposed rendering of the Pixel 9a." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ri5t9SatZcsjr9hhZCJW7X.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1415" height="790" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Again, there's one important factor to take into consideration, and that's the price. Assuming that Google and Samsung keep prices the same, this means the Pixel 9a will come in at $499, undercutting the iPhone 16e. While the Galaxy S25 FE would set you back $649, about $150 more than the 16e.</p><p>Although I won't be picking up an iPhone 16e for myself, I am curious about how well it will perform those AI-powered tasks. If it's able to keep up with the iPhone 16, then Apple has yet again put some immense pressure on both Google and Samsung.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-io-2025-date-official" target="_blank">Google I/O 2025</a> is right around the corner and the invite-only affair will be live-streamed for the world to see and learn more than it ever wanted to know about <del>AI</del> Google. You probably know a little bit about Google I/O but chances are that stops once you get past the first-day keynote speech.</p><p>Google I/O is a lot more than that. But it's also something you aren't particularly interested in or think you need to care about no matter how big an Android fan you might be.</p>
<p>So what's the big deal and why are so many Android enthusiasts talking about Google I/O? They're really not. I'll explain.</p>
<h2 id="keynote-speeches-are-an-outlier-2">Keynote speeches are an outlier</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="LTtQJqtxv6zyMCLuip8MHD" name="Google-IO-2024-Sundar-Pichai.jpeg" alt="Sundar Pichai on stage at Google I/O 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LTtQJqtxv6zyMCLuip8MHD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Everything you know about Google I/O probably comes from one of the keynote speeches. There is a day-one keynote where Sundar and company get on stage to talk about the new and hopefully exciting things that are coming to the world of Android and Google, and there are "secondary" keynotes like <em>What's new in Chrome</em>.</p><p>These are often fascinating. Historically they've given us a good look at what Google thinks we want even if the last few have morphed into an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-keynote-made-cool-ai-features-look-boring">AI drinking game</a>. This is what most of the tech press will be covering and it is all the information the average Android fan cares about.</p>
<p>So what about the rest of the three days? If you like programming and development, the rest of the time is for you.</p><p>I don't mean just workshops and tutorials for coding practices (though those are at I/O, too). You can learn about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-in-android-studio-debut">tools developers need</a>, new changes to how third parties can integrate with core features, and even updates on licensing and agreements you need to follow to develop for the Google ecosystem.</p>
<p>It's good stuff and very important. It's also not something most people care about, which explains why tech publications never talk about it. Would you rather see another article about what's coming in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> or one about updating your developer toolkit to leverage new APIs?</p><p>That's because you're (probably) not a developer. You do not need to know about any of this stuff, no matter how important it all is.</p>
<p>That's the thing; <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-improving-the-tools-app-developers-use-is-just-as-important-as-any-android-update">it is important</a>. More important than incremental UI changes or new AI features will ever be, because these tools are what builds an Android/Google ecosystem.</p><p>The same goes for any platform. Apple and Microsoft would not be where they are today without third-parties building reasons to use them. Think about it — do you want to use a smartphone platform that has zero apps? You didn't answer "yes" but if you did I'll mail you an old <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/launcher-10-android-phone-windows-phone-os-style">Windows phone</a>. That was said in jest but it shows exactly what I mean — Windows on phones died because the app ecosystem just wasn't there.</p>
<p>Developer conferences exist to try to make sure that doesn't happen. Hour after hour of complicated and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://io.google/2025/">confusing presentations</a> might seem pointless to you, but the person building the next great idea is paying close attention.</p><p>It's OK that Google I/O isn't for you. What you can do is follow us to see the new and exciting things coming and leave the rest for the people who need it. You can then enjoy what they've done with everything they learned.</p>

<ul><li>Google is likely to reintroduce the “Battery Health” settings page with Android 16 for Pixel devices.</li><li>The page displays battery condition, and capacity, and provides tips for extending battery lifespan.</li><li>Google is also tipped to be working on a new feature for Pixel phones that will recalibrate battery measurements over weeks.</li></ul>

<hr>
<p>Android 16 beta 2 was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-beta-2-is-here-with-new-media-camera-and-graphics-updates">released</a> late last week for Pixel device owners, which has been a significant update over the first one, with upgrades to the camera and media settings. New findings now reveal that Google is probably bringing the long-awaited “Battery health” settings page again with the latest beta.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/16/android-16-pixel-battery-health/">9to5Google</a> and their APK Insights of the Settings Services app bearing version 1.1.0.717462792 — has revealed strings regarding a new Battery Health feature, which was ventured back in 2022 — with Android 13 QPR1. While it didn’t turn up to be live, it appears the search giant is giving it a try again this time with Android 16.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1344px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:222.62%;"><img id="njxfRzKJS5GdEGuVoQuYpT" name="Pixel-battery-health-android-16" alt="Android 16's battery health feature" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/njxfRzKJS5GdEGuVoQuYpT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1344" height="2992" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The new page can be found in Pixel phones featuring the latest beta and users can navigate to Settings> Battery> Battery Health — right above the Battery percentage toggle. Going in further showcases the “View battery health status and tips to extend your battery’s lifespan” section.</p><p>Right underneath, Pixel phone users will be able to check their battery condition, which shows whether it is normal or not. Battery capacity presumably indicates it's lifespan. If the phone is brand new, it is likely going to show 100%, and it should gradually decrease as the phone is used for longer periods, like a couple of years, for example.</p>
<p>Pixel phone users can further get to know how to take care of their device’s batteries with the help of guides and relevant articles provided in the support tab. Additionally, there is a Charging optimization toggle, which can be enabled.</p><p>On the whole, the new inclusion looks to be a significant improvement over the previous spotting in the Android 13 QPR1, notes 9to5. The same added section, previously just featured the support articles on how to take good care of the device’s battery by enabling adaptive charging, and other such suggestions.</p>

<p>The publication has further found out through the APK strings that Google will likely offer a new ability to “improve battery measurements” by bringing in a recalibration process, which will be carried out over weeks. Post which, the battery capacity status will likely be updated. If at all users see a decline in the status, they might perceive their battery lasting “less time between charges.”</p><p>It is encouraging to have the feature in the works, which can turn out to be quite useful for Pixel owners if it rolls out via the Android 16 stable release.</p>

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-faq"><span>FAQ</span></h3>
<h2 id="is-the-motorola-razr-plus-2024-worth-it-2">Is the Motorola Razr Plus (2024) worth it?</h2>
<p>Absolutely. The clamshell device is just as impressive as Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip 6 in just about every way imaginable, but it goes on sale way more often. You get efficient Android performance thanks to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3s processor, plus a great camera with a 2X telephoto sensor, Moto AI software features, and a durable folding hinge. </p><p>The Razr Plus doesn't get quite as many software updates as Samsung's 2024 flip phone, but that's a small price to pay when you consider how many deals are regularly available for the device. After all, there's a reason we called it the "perfect flip phone" in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">our 4.5/5-star review</a>.</p>

<h2 id="will-there-be-a-motorola-razr-plus-released-in-2025-2">Will there be a Motorola Razr Plus released in 2025?</h2>
<p>Although we don't have any official information just yet, a number of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025">rumors and leaks</a> have suggested that we should be getting a new Motorola Razr Plus at some point this year. </p><p>This 2025 is expected to retain its vegan leather finish and large cover display, with the same Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset that powers the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 series</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> under the hood. You can also expect the phone to sport some new and improved AI features. If we're lucky, Motorola will keep the $999 price tag for the 2025 phone, but there's a chance it'll go up a bit, à la Google's latest offerings. </p>

<hr>
<p>With the Google Pixel 9 already about six months old, we're already starting to look ahead to the Google Pixel 10 series. It looks like Google is, too, because four new GSMA database entries point to the presumed model numbers for each Pixel 10 variant, according to a report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/exclusive-google-pixel-10-series-model-numbers-leaked-gsma-database/" target="_blank">SmartPrix</a>. For those unfamiliar, this IMEI database is hosted by the Global System for Mobile Communications Association (GSMA) and phones are added to it as they near regulatory approval.</p><p>The four unreleased smartphone models added to the GSMA database have Google, Inc. listed as the manufacturer — all but confirming these are part of the Google Pixel 10 series. These models are expected to be the Google Pixel 10, Google Pixel 10 Pro, Google Pixel 10 Pro XL, and the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold.</p><p>According to the entries, the Google Pixel 10 series will have the following model numbers:</p>
<ul><li>Google Pixel 10: GLBW0, GL066</li><li>Google Pixel 10 Pro: G4QUR, GN4F5</li><li>Google Pixel 10 Pro XL: GUL82</li><li>Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold: GU0NP</li></ul>
<p>Compared to the average leak, these listings are extremely reliable because they come straight from the GSMA and Google. Typically, phones start appearing in databases and regulatory filings as they get closer to release. Due to the new Pixel release window in August, the Pixel 10 series is likely about six months away — that's why we're starting to hear more about the unreleased devices now.</p><p>You'll notice that the Pixel 10a isn't listed here, and that's because it's still over a year away from release. The Google Pixel 9a, a midrange phone and a successor to the Pixel 8a, isn't even out yet. Although the release for the Pixel 9a is nearing, it makes sense that the Pixel 10a isn't more than a rumor right now.</p><p>Speaking of rumors, you can read all about the Google Pixel 10 series and everything we want to see <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">in this complete guide</a>.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung is extending its digital aid to more vehicles with a new update inbound for a Wallet feature.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-wallet-expands-digital-key-support-for-select-volvo-cars-and-polestar-vehicles">company announced</a> a Digital Key expansion through the Samsung Wallet app to two more car brands: Volvo and Polestar. Not every car under these brands will support the company's digital key. The post states the Volvo EX90 and the Polestar 3 are the first to receive this Digital Key expansion update for Galaxy phone users.</p><p>The press release states "more vehicles will follow;" however, Samsung does not state when drivers of either brand could see more cars added.</p><p>There's no specific date, but Samsung states drivers can expect its Digital Key expansion to hit the Volvo EX90 "this month" in Europe, North America, Latin America, and Asia. The Polestar 3 is also expected to receive it in Europe, North America, and Asia "this month."</p><p>Of course, Digital Key support means users can use their phones to lock, unlock, and start their cars. Samsung reiterates using UWB (ultra-wideband) connectivity for these features, which can be activated remotely. NFC is available with a Digital Key for "tap-to-unlock and start." Samsung Wallet even lets users share their Digital Key with others; however, the only restriction is it must be done between Galaxy devices.</p><p>The company draws attention to its EAL6+ security certification, which is stated to protect users against unauthorized access.</p>

<p>Samsung has been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsungs-digital-car-key-can-now-unlock-certain-kia-bmw-and-genesis-models">slowly expanding</a> its coverage of Digital Keys for various car brands, like Kia, BMW, and Genesis models. That update featured limited vehicles for each brand, which first kicked off in South Korea. Mirroring the update today, the cars received UWB and NFC support to assist users in ways that are most useful to them.</p><p>Most recently, Samsung brought its Digital Key via the Wallet app <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/your-samsung-phone-is-about-to-double-as-a-digital-key-for-certain-audi-cars">to select Audi vehicles</a>. The company announced its initial availability for the following models: the A6 e-tron, the Q6 e-tron, and the A5. Compatibility isn't so widespread as Samsung stated the Galaxy S20 series to the Galaxy S24 can utilize its Digital Key with Audi. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on" target="_blank">Galaxy S25</a> will likely find support for Audi vehicles, too.</p><p>Elsewhere, the BMW app on Android and iOS brought "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/bmw-digital-key-plus-android-support">Digital Key Plus</a>" support to Galaxy and Pixel phones. This could be an alternative if users would rather lean on BMW's app instead of the Samsung Wallet. During its rollout, the post informed users of its limited compatibility with BMW cars manufactured from 2022 onward.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google seems to be doing some damage control after it deleted several cultural events from its official holiday list on the Google Calendar. Even though this move was made last year in 2024, several users took notice of it now and were left disappointed by this move. Black History Month, Indigenous People Month, Jewish Heritage, Holocaust Remembrance Day, and Hispanic Heritage have also been removed, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/calendar/thread/322570334/why-is-pride-month-removed-from-the-google-calendar?hl=en" target="_blank">a Google product expert</a> (as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/608858/google-calendar-missing-events-holidays" target="_blank">The Verge</a>).</p><p>While this may just seem like any other update that Google tends to make, without announcing the change it seems like it didn't want to grab a lot of attention when the move was made. Several users took to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/calendar/thread/322035139?fbclid=IwY2xjawIOCbtleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHaAaRLxfNUJ_ngEQv6jC11CtlYv4Pjgrcgztv2pABS_SMe7bE9lPjglvYw_aem_qKRtk6CAhPutSKpxGKrcpw" target="_blank">Calendar's help page</a> to express their concerns on the issue, and probably find out why Google chose to make this move without giving them a heads up.</p><p>But Google does have its side of the story. Earlier, the Calendar team relied on a manual approach to fill out important dates and events. This meant the team had to seive through and enter each event while keeping in mind the cultural celebrations across numerous countries. According to the company, this time-consuming process resulted in some events being missed, which highlighted a need for a more streamlined approach.</p><p>In a statement to The Verge, Google’s spokesperson Madison Cushman Veld said, "We got feedback that some other events and countries were missing — and maintaining hundreds of moments manually and consistently globally wasn’t scalable or sustainable," Veld added.</p><p>Google only put out a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/feed/google-calendar-changes-cultural-moments/">public statement </a>on Feb. 12, following some backlash it received. It said that it wasn't "feasible to put hundreds of moments in everyone’s calendars." And that by showing only public holidays and observances from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://timeanddate.com/" target="_blank">timeanddate.com</a> it will be more consistent with other online calendar providers. However, it has left the calendar open for those who'd like to add holidays/events manually.</p>

<h2 id="why-this-move-seems-off-2">Why this move seems off</h2>
<p>Google may have removed significant events like Black History Month, Pride Month, and others, but this has sparked a debate not just for me, but others too on representation and visibility. As someone who lives in Toronto, Canada, I've been exposed to enough diversity, and to understand and experience different holidays that are so important to the North American community is not only a privilege but also comes as a reminder for me to be an ally.</p><p>While Google may push it off by stating sustainability reasons, it comes off as the company valuing efficiency over cultural sensitivity. In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/feed/google-calendar-changes-cultural-moments/">community support thread</a>, one user wrote:</p><p>"What benefits do you get from seeing marginalized communities suffer? That is disrespectful and sadistic. I hope you change ... not recognizing the hard work of these kinds of communities for rights, equality, and recognition."</p><p>While another wrote:  "By removing Black History Month, Pride, and Women's History Month -and others - GOOGLE is attempting to delegitimize these designated months. It seems cowardly  - and backward.  What is GOOGLE afraid of?"</p><p>This move even though made late last year, came as a surprise to many seeing the change in the new calendar year when users noticed the events missing in both desktop and mobile apps. This made them believe that it could be an impact of recently inaugurated President Donald Trump's executive order that overturned diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs.</p><p>Following this, several companies, including Google, said it was reviewing some diversity initiatives and effectively removing its goal to hire more employees from underrepresented groups. This is surprising since Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apnews.com/article/google-diversity-equity-inclusion-program-trump-16a937d5d9b6447251c4c40c2ad1c915">prides itself </a>on hiring people from underrepresented groups for more than a decade now. But in a recent 10-K report that Alphabet filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Google effectively omitted this line“committed to making diversity, equity, and inclusion part of everything we do and to growing a workforce that is representative of the users we serve.”</p><p>With the already sensitive political scenario in the U.S., this move from Google tipped the scales, making it a little more difficult for these communities to feel seen according to many users.</p>

<p>There seems to be no end to this debate, while Google tried to justify its move by stating that, as a company, it continues to celebrate and promote a variety of cultural moments across its products.  Additionally, it said that Google Calendar is customizable, so users can go into their calendars and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/13748345?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&sjid=9012651685422336560-NC" target="_blank">add all the important events</a>, just like they would to a friend's birthday or an upcoming meeting, the company argues.</p><p>The tech giant also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sustainabilitymag.com/articles/google-calendar-removes-black-history-month-pride-month">confirms</a> that these changes will not affect other cultural acknowledgments, such as Google Doodles, which frequently remind users about important dates and events.</p><p>But it misses the point. The question isn't about personalization, it is more about collectively acknowledging these events on a larger scale and showing allyship with the people who've contributed to the betterment of these marginalized communities.</p><p>Some users have simply decided to boycott Google Calendar as their first choice, in a digital protest so to speak, while some continue to advocate on these community threads for people to add these events manually to their calendars.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google is giving one of its most underrated apps some space to shine for users with busy schedules.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/18/google-tasks-website-2/">9to5Google</a>, the company recently went live with a dedicated website for the Tasks app. Google keeps things simple as the Tasks website is extremely light with options to create new tasks and complete them in its main view. Users will find a "My Tasks" box centered on their screen with empty bubbles that you can click to complete a task.</p><p>The "Completed" button produces a drop-down menu if you're curious about everything you've accomplished.</p><p>The "Add a Task" option from the My Tasks box is a quick way to add something. Users are asked to deliver a task title, some details if necessary, and when it should be completed: Today, Tomorrow, or you can click the Calendar option to select a date. Another option is similar to Twitter's (oops, X's) repost icon. Clicking that will let you "repeat" it, so you won't have to retype the task's contents.</p><p>The left-hand side hosts your task categories and a proper "Create" button. This is your standard task creation view as it creates an overlayed box for information. Unlike the quick add method, the Create button gives a full view of your title, manual date/time input, if it should repeat, and a description box.</p><p>Additionally, as the publication notes, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://tasks.google.com/tasks/">dedicated Google Tasks website</a> will not redirect users to the Calendar app. The two have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-calendar-for-android-finally-adds-a-dedicated-tasks-view">become inseparable</a>, but now, users can have more organization with which Google app they want to interact. Tasks still appear in the Calendar app.</p>

<p>Google Tasks has gone under the radar for years, turning it into quite the underrated app — especially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-tasks-best-gmail-feature">when it comes to Gmail</a>. The company added a Task creation button when checking your emails, which lets you create one, as well as a link back to the message. Users can add their own notes to ensure they remember what needs to be done.</p><p>This level of creation mirrors what users would find in the Tasks app, which is buried in the Calendar or accessible through its dedicated website.</p><p>What's more, in September, Gemini on the web <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-gets-google-keep-and-google-tasks-extensions-support">picked up extensions</a> for Tasks and Keep. Users can type @Google Tasks when talking to Gemini to create a new item remotely, without diving into the app yourself. Google detailed several prompts users can utilize, like "Remind me on [date] at [time] to [task]" or "Add [task] in my to-dos."</p>

<hr>
<p>Apple today <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-debuts-iphone-16e-a-powerful-new-member-of-the-iphone-16-family/">announced</a> the iPhone 16e, a $599 spiritual successor to the iPhone SE with a 6.1-inch screen and an A18 chip. There's a lot to like about this midrange smartphone, and it has the potential to shake up the market — potentially disrupting phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Google Pixel 8a</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a>. However, Android users should only be worried about one iPhone 16e specification, and that's the Apple C1 modem.</p><p>5G modems are one of the rare mobile device components that only a few companies on the planet have created with success. Qualcomm, MediaTek, Samsung, and Huawei are a few of them, and that's basically the end of the list. The iPhone 16e represents a breakthrough for Apple because it's the first device to use an Apple-designed modem, called the C1.</p><p>Just like how Apple developed its own in-house silicon and phased out Intel for its Mac processors, you can expect future iPhones to eventually use Apple C-series modems exclusively. The company told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-reveals-first-custom-modem-chip-shifting-away-qualcomm-2025-02-19/" target="_blank">Reuters</a> that Apple will roll out its own modems across all of its products, though the exact timeline for that rollout is unclear.</p><p>The iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro lineups use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-x75-5g-modem">Qualcomm modems</a>, which have, to date, been faster and more reliable than anything Apple has been able to develop on its own. For $1 billion, the company bought "the majority" of Intel's modem business in 2019. It wanted to make its own modems, but as of 2023, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/apple-iphone-modem-chip-failure-6fe33d19" target="_blank">Wall Street Journal</a>  report detailed Apple's struggles — and thus we got iPhones with Qualcomm modems for two more years.</p><p>Now, it seems the company is finally on the right track to ditch Qualcomm in favor of its own 5G hardware. The Apple C1 chip features a baseband modem fabricated using the 4-nanometer process and a 7nm transceiver, per Reuters. It lacks millimeter-wave 5G support, but Apple says it offers "industry-leading efficiency" that leads to better battery life.</p><p>Meanwhile, Qualcomm believes it's still the industry leader in cellular technologies.</p><p>"The best commercial smartphones currently feature our leading 5G-Advanced modem-RF system, which uses AI to optimize for the fastest and highest-capacity networks in every country," a Qualcomm spokesperson told Android Central. "We'll soon be unveiling the future of connectivity at MWC Barcelona."</p><p>Apple has no plans to sell C-series modems externally, and that's unlikely to change. So, why should Android fans care? The iPhone 16e and the C1 modem matter because they outline the blueprint for large Android OEMs to ditch Qualcomm themselves for their own in-house chips. Following the precedent Apple just set, it's possible that one day we could see Samsung use Exynos chips for both mobile processors and modems, which would be huge for the Android market.</p>

<p>Apple's reasons for using its own C-series modems are quite clear. For one, they're likely cheaper. Apple spent a billion dollars buying part of Intel's 5G business and maybe more on research and development, but it also pays a fortune to Qualcomm for the licensing of its technologies and the use of its modems. Based on napkin math and build-of-materials estimates from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wccftech.com/how-much-revenue-qualcomm-will-make-through-iphone-16-5g-modem-sales/" target="_blank">WCCF Tech</a>, Apple could pay Qualcomm over $2.5 billion dollars if it meets its sales targets for the iPhone 16 lineup.</p><p>Aside from cash considerations, in-house modems allow Apple to tightly integrate its modems, processors, and software for greater efficiency.</p>
<h2 id="android-phones-could-use-a-lower-bom-and-more-efficiency-too-2">Android phones could use a lower BOM and more efficiency, too</h2>
<p>The good news? There's absolutely no reason why Android phones from Samsung or Google couldn't also benefit from a lower build-of-materials cost and greater efficiency. If one of those companies managed to build an SoC and modem good enough, it could leave Qualcomm behind once and for all — result in Android phones with better battery life and potentially a lower price tag.</p><p>Android phones are a bit trickier than iPhones, because modems are typically integrated at the SoC level. For instance, because the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Samsung Galaxy S25</a> uses the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a> chipset, it also uses a Qualcomm modem. Apple and Samsung would both love to use their own in-house modems, but they're working in reverse. Apple made its processors first, then worked on modems. By comparison, Samsung already has the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9a-modem-tensor-g4-rumored-changes">Exynos Modem 5400 ready</a> — it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4-rumors">inside the Google Pixel 9 series</a> — but it can't quite get its Exynos processors up to par.</p><p>Apple's strategy is simple. Start with cheaper, lower-stakes phones to iron out any potential issues with the Apple C1 modem without tweaking flagship iPhones before its 5G technology is ready for primetime. And in a way, Samsung is already employing this strategy. Plenty of Samsung devices already use Exynos processors and modems as the company desperately tries to ramp up its chipmaking quality.</p><p>All that's left is for Samsung to make an Exynos chip that can go toe-to-toe with Qualcomm's best. When it does, Samsung will be able to leave Qualcomm behind, having near complete control over the processors, modems, and software in its devices for peak efficiency.</p><p>Apple is officially proof that it's possible. However, if <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-samsung-galaxy-s25-will-be-exclusively-powered-by-snapdragon-8-elite-leaker-claims">recent yield estimates for Exynos chips</a> are any indication, Samsung has a long way to go.</p>

<p>So, you’re in the market for an ultra-durable smartwatch. For Apple iPhone owners, the choice is simple: go with the Apple Watch Ultra 2. But for Android phone owners, it’s a bit more complicated. Two top-notch models worth considering are the new OnePlus Watch 3 vs. Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra. Both are fantastic options, but which one should you choose? We’re here to help.</p>
<h2 id="oneplus-watch-3-vs-samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-design-and-durability-2">OnePlus Watch 3 vs. Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra: Design and durability</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="XGMfVFB3GyuriuV4tB2hi" name="oneplus-watch-3-workout-watch-face-with-shoes-01" alt="A OnePlus Watch 3 with a fitness watch face on a pair of workout shoes" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XGMfVFB3GyuriuV4tB2hi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The OnePlus Watch 3 comes in an Obsidian or Emerald finish with a stainless-steel case and titanium bezel with a PVD coating for extra durability and scratch-resistance. It has a 2D sapphire crystal display for even further strength and ruggedness.</p><p>The watch meets MIL-STD-810H military-grade durability standards, so you can be confident that it can withstand the elements and day-to-day use. It boasts an IP68 and 5ATM rating so it’s resistant to both water and dust: you can comfortably go for a swim, shower, or run in the rain with this watch on.</p><p>Equipped with a 1.5-inch LTPO AMOLED 466 x 466 screen, you’ll get up to 2,200 nits of brightness, so you can easily view the screen in even bright sunlight. While it’s on the larger and heavier side when it comes to smartwatches, it’s still comfortable to wear all day.</p><p>What fans will especially appreciate is that it has a redesigned crown compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a> that can now actually rotate, not just be pushed in for selections. In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-hands-on">his initial review</a> after using the OnePlus Watch 3 for 10 days, Nicholas Sutrich says the crown’s design is “phenomenal,” and even more comfortable to use than the rotating crown on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Google Pixel Watch 3</a> thanks to the larger size and the textured and offset angle.</p><p>Battery life is what really sets this smartwatch apart. It employs the same dual-chip architecture as the previous generation OnePlus 2, which consists of a Snapdragon W5 chip to handle the more intense features, like workout tracking and apps, and an upgraded BES2800 chip to tackle everything else that runs in the background.</p><p>Thanks to this dual-chip set-up along with the 631mAh Silicon NanoStack battery, the same one the company uses in its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> smartphone, you get up to five days or 120 hours per charge in smart mode, which is the standard, everyday mode. This decreases to up to three days or 72 hours in heavy usage mode, but you can get as much as up to 16 days of use in power-saving mode. Leveraging VOOC fast charging, you can plug it in for 10 minutes for an entire extra day of usage.</p><p>Sutrich calls the battery life “legitimately insane,” adding that a quick 25-minute charge got him from just 19% to 99% when using the included charging dock and a OnePlus 80W charger. I once had mine at 20% battery and was still able to do a 30-minute workout, a 40-minute walk, and get through the rest of the day in power-saving mode without it dying on me. That’s pretty incredible!</p><p>Along with the standard selection of watch faces from which to choose, including using your own photos, you can also use a Video Watch Face with the OnePlus Watch 3. While this will drain the battery more quickly, it’s cool to have a moving, animated image of your own as the face. I, for example, use an image of water hitting the rocks on a beach that provides a nice soothing reprieve when I don’t need to see my stats on screen.</p><p>You also get access to download tons of apps, including Google apps like Gmail, Maps, and Wallet. The OnePlus Watch 3 is ultra-affordable and comes with two years of software and security support.</p>

<p>How does the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra compare? As Samsung’s answer to the Apple Watch Ultra, the Galaxy Watch Ultra is the company’s ultra-rugged smartwatch, designed for outdoor adventurers. And it has plenty of features and design functions to match.</p><p>Available in Titanium Gray, Titanium White, or Titanium Silver, the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra has a same-sized 1.5-inch Sapphire Crystal Super AMOLED display with a slightly higher resolution at 480 x 480. The Dynamic Lug System makes it more comfortable for all-day wear. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Michael Hicks says in his review</a> that the watch is somewhat clunky, though he grew accustomed to having it on his wrist over time.</p><p>Along with the standard band that comes in the box, you can opt for a Bespoke model, choosing from Marine, Trail, or PeakForm, depending on the activities you do the most. Hicks found it simple to swap bands using the Dynamic Lug system, though this limits the options to Samsung bands only.</p><p>Unlike the OnePlus Watch 3, the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra does not have a rotating bezel. It does, however, have a Quick Button that you can customize to open whatever function you like, and do things like pause an activity during a workout.</p><p>As an extremely durable smartwatch, the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra is made from a Titanium Grade 4 frame and boasts an incredible 10ATM water resistance. This means you can swim even deeper with it (down to 100 meters for up to 10 minutes). It also has an IP68 rating and meets the same MIL-STD-810H rating for durability.</p><p>Additionally, this smartwatch is rated to operate at more altitudes as well, from 500 meters below sea level up to 9,000 meters high. This makes it a good option for swimmers, cyclers, hikers, climbers, and those who love to engage in other extreme outdoor sports.</p><p>Choose from a wide range of watch faces, and the watch even automatically switches to Night Mode so you can more easily check your stats at a glance in the dark. Peak brightness is higher at an impressive 3,000 nits, so viewing the screen in sunlight is comfortable, too. Hicks says it “looks fantastic in direct California sunlight, richly colorful and unimpeded by reflections.” You can access all the Google apps your heart desires as well as Galaxy services and other compatible third-party apps.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra has a smaller 590mAh battery that promises about 2.5 days or 60 hours of regular use, up to 48 hours in Exercise Power Saving mode, and up to 100 hours or four days in Power Saving mode. It won’t last as long as the OnePlus Watch 3 but Hicks finds these numbers to be accurate following Samsung’s software update patch that fixed initial battery life headaches. It supports WPC-based fast charging with a compatible WPC wireless charger.</p><p>A plus with this smartwatch is that the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra comes with four years of software and security support, twice as long as the OnePlus Watch 3. However, it’s also twice the price. There is an LTE option if you want cellular connectivity on the go without your phone, though this adds to the bottom line and recurring costs as well.</p>

<p>Let’s look at how these two smartwatches compare when it comes to basic specs.</p>

<h2 id="oneplus-watch-3-vs-samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-what-you-can-do-with-them-2">OnePlus Watch 3 vs. Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra: What you can do with them</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="G8Kf9rkCF3cCrn95J9FVHL" name="oneplus-watch-3-60-second-health-check" alt="Using the new 60-second health check-in feature on a OnePlus Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/G8Kf9rkCF3cCrn95J9FVHL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now that we have established that both these watches are ultra-durable with fantastic, bright screens and good (or even better) battery life, what can you do with them?</p><p>The OnePlus Watch 3, as noted, employs a dual chip architecture that makes it both battery efficient and powerful. Running Google Wear OS 5, it captures all the data you would expect from a premium smartwatch. It has advanced heart rate monitoring thanks to the 8-channel optical heart rate sensor along with vascular health monitoring, a wrist temperature sensor, and a 16-channel optical pulse oximeter sensor. Sutrich indeed says that health tracking has been drastically improved compared to the OnePlus Watch 2. In fact, he calls it “monumental.”</p><p>There are more than 100 sports modes from which to choose, along with fat burn efficiency in running mode, which serious runners will appreciate. There are 11 pro workout modes as well, including ones like racket sports whereby the watch can analyze metrics like strokes and swing speed. There’s also auto-detection for six common workouts.</p><p>The OHealth app has been updated to include a new health data view that summarizes key metrics about your health and wellness. This includes not only activity but also sleep, with more accurate sleep tracking than in previous generation models as well with features like a score and even snoring data. Sutrich loves how the OHealth app now presents the data, calling the organization concise with the laying not wasting any space. “I really love that I can view everything on my watch afterwards,” he adds.</p><p>A 60-second health check-in feature that measures heart rate, blood oxygen, mental wellness, wrist temperature, sleep quality, and vascular age all at once in a single minute is coming via an over-the-air update in March 2025. There’s also ECG readings but this feature isn’t available in North America with no plans to arrive here either.</p><p>Speaking of mental wellness, there’s also a new 360 mind and body feature that checks in on your heart rate variability, stress relief, and breathing to provide stats as well as tips to help you improve.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="9Tpd5FVeGcDAeu3mAesDZd" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-run-activity.jpeg" alt="The main run activity data screen on the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9Tpd5FVeGcDAeu3mAesDZd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra is, as mentioned, designed primarily for adventurers and athletes. As such, it’s a pretty powerful smartwatch in its own right.</p><p>Running on an Exynos W1000 processor, it also comes loaded with WearOS 5 as well, affording advanced performance and smooth operation. Hicks says it isn’t markedly faster than previous-generation phones, but you won’t notice a lot of lag and it can handle demanding tasks without issue.</p><p>You can track tons of different workout types as well as sports. This includes multi-course workouts in the new Multi-sports tile, ideal for those who have signed up for a triathlon, for example. Cyclers will appreciate the Functional Threshold Power (FTP) measurement, which clocks their maximum cycling power in four minutes using AI-powered metrics.</p><p>You’ll also enjoy features like personalized heart rate zones along with Samsung’s BioActive sensor and a temperature sensor.</p>

<p>There are some additional cool features with both these smartwatches. While the OnePlus Watch 3 works with all brands of Android devices (sadly, no iPhone support with the OHealth app just yet), you’ll get an enhanced experience when using it with a OnePlus phone. This includes the ability to use the watch as a controller for compatible video playback sites, like TikTok and YouTube Shorts. You can also use it as a camera controller with both OnePlus and OPPO phones.</p><p>The Watch also has features like Find my device and an SOS mode for safety, ideal for those who go running in the early morning or late-night hours, for example, or in case of any type of emergency.</p><p>There are useful safety features in the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra as well, including an emergency siren and emergency alerts.</p><p>It, too, works with all brands of Android devices (no iPhone support either) but you get specific features and a more seamless pairing with a Samsung Galaxy phone. It also works wonderfully with other Samsung devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Samsung Galaxy Ring</a>.

<p>When the decision comes down to the OnePlus Watch 3 vs. Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra, you can’t go wrong with either. If you have a OnePlus phone, the obvious choice is the OnePlus Watch 3. If you use a Samsung Galaxy device, the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra is a no-brainer option. But if you aren’t tied to either ecosystem or you have one of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">the best Android phones</a> from another brand, this is where it gets tricky.</p><p>There’s no denying that the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra is expensive, much more expensive than the OnePlus Watch 3. But it has features that extreme athletes will appreciate, including the 10ATM rating that makes it the ideal choice for those who often engage in water sports and activities.</p><p>However, it’s a lot of watch for everyday users. If you’re just looking for a solid and rugged smartwatch for everyday use, the OnePlus Watch 3 is the better option. Not only is it rugged and durable as well, albeit with a lesser water-resistance rating, but you also get a much longer battery life. It has enhanced sensors and can track all types of sports and activities. You might not get some of the same intricate features, but you get others, like those pro workout modes if you play tennis, for example, or you’re a serious runner.</p><p>At a fraction of the price, the OnePlus Watch 3 offers better value. However, since it’s only supported via software for half the time, you’ll have to take this into consideration as well. This doesn’t mean you <em>have</em> to replace it after two years: the watch will continue to work provided you take care of it. But this limitation is worth keeping in mind.</p><p>That said, even if you upgraded with a newer model two years from now at the same price, you’re still coming out ahead and not breaking the bank now. So, go with the OnePlus Watch 3 unless you’re a serious athlete who owns a Samsung Galaxy phone and wants the best pairing possible with that device.</p>

<ul><li>Google is rolling out a couple of updates, beginning with iPhones, which receive a "Search Screen with Google Lens" in Chrome and the Google app.</li><li>The company is also upgrading AI Overview's visual search knowledge through Lens for more "novel" cases.</li><li>The search feature hitting iPhones is reminiscent of Android's larger Circle to Search feature, which lets users surface it anywhere for help.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is bringing a major search function for Apple's iPhones while also improving the search experience across all devices.</p><p>In a press release, the company states iOS devices — specifically iPhones — will soon receive a familiar "screen search" capability. Google states Apple's smartphone users will be able to "draw, highlight, or tap" anything on their screen to run a Search; however, its usage is limited. The post states iPhones can only use this screen search function in Chrome or the Google app for iOS.</p><p>In short, tapping the three-dot menu at the bottom of Chrome iOS' UI will surface a short menu with a "Search Screen with Google Lens" option. When tapped, your screen will turn multi-colored, indicating the time to draw or highlight what you're curious about. After a brief wait, Google Lens will run that query through the Search engine and display any relevant information.</p><p>Moreover, iPhone users can add a question <em>after </em>the query is completed, in case they're interested in learning more about the subject.</p><p>The post states this screen search will work for articles, products, and videos found in Chrome or the Google app on iOS. There's more to this as the company teases it will soon add a Lens icon to the address bar in Chrome for iPhones, similar to the web-experience.</p><p>The company adds iPhones will begin receiving this update "this week" globally for Chrome and the Google app.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:442px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:135.75%;"><img id="GrFewEFxKgRzva7poXueYe" name="google-lens-ios-chrome-update-screen-search" alt="Google Lens is bringing an update to iPhones that lets users search content on their screens by drawing, highlighting, or tapping in Chrome and the Google app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GrFewEFxKgRzva7poXueYe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="442" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Additionally, the tech giant is giving Search's AI Overviews an upgrade. Google states it's rolling out an update that expands the bite-sized tool's knowledge of imagery for better assistance. According to Google, AI Overviews will now leverage "advanced AI models" through Lens to "provide information on the contents of more novel or unique images."</p><p>Google states, that with this new upgrade, users won't need to write a question to aid the AI in discovering the information they need. The visual search <em>should </em>be enough to surface answers to images that are out of the norm: like a shattered windshield.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:387px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:155.04%;"><img id="9HDhgRZeVDtxQB5Dqsymij" name="google-lens-ai-overviews-visual-search-upgrade" alt="Google Lens is upgrading its visual search capabilities on Android and iOS as AI Overviews become more knowledgeable about "novel" subjects/imagery." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9HDhgRZeVDtxQB5Dqsymij.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="387" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The update is preparing to roll out in the Google app on Android and iOS "this week" for English-language users where AI Overviews are available. The company states this expansion of knowledge will hit Chrome and desktops "soon."</p><p>It goes without saying that the "Search Screen" function for iPhones is a slightly toned-down variant of Android's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>. Apple's devices are restricted to only a couple of apps, and it's unclear if that'll be extended in the future. Nevertheless, those on Android with Circle to Search support can surface the AI-backed function anywhere on their device for assistance.</p><p>Also, the last Google Lens update was in October, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-lens-search-ads-video-function-update">brought recording capabilities</a> to Android. To expand its visual search prowess, users can record a short video of something they're curious about and Lens will run its contents through Search. The engine should return an AI Overview packed with bulleted information about what you've recorded.</p>

Would the OnePlus Watch 3 launch with Wear OS 5, or an older version like some TicWatches? And how quickly would the two promised version updates arrive on the OnePlus Watch 2?</p>

<p>Thanks to the OnePlus Watch 3 and clarification from the OnePlus PR team, we have our answers. And I think it's set a precedent for what to expect from any Wear OS watch that doesn't have "Galaxy" or "Pixel" in the name.</p><p>My colleague Nick Sutrich got <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-hands-on">hands-on time with the OnePlus Watch 3</a> this past week, and he's highly positive about it so far. It's a major hardware <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-vs-watch-2">upgrade over the OnePlus Watch 2</a> thanks to the active crown, fixed health tracking, eye-friendly display, smarter coprocessor, and larger battery capacity.</p><p>OnePlus promises a five-day battery life, and Nick's Watch 3 has surpassed this estimate so far. Some credit must go to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/most-android-flagships-are-getting-an-exciting-battery-upgrade-in-2025">silicon-carbon battery</a>, but we can also consider its switch to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a>: Google added some battery-saving background changes last year that'll pay off in subtle ways for OnePlus Watch 3 buyers.</p><p>We're still diving into the OnePlus Watch 3's software to try and flesh out what's new and different. But when we asked OnePlus, their answer was very illuminating:</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Gmail supporting email sync, reply functionality, and folder management; Google Wallet supporting boarding passes, concert tickets, and membership cards; and Google Maps syncing and navigating more seamlessly. Google's website should also have a run-down of the upgrades between Wear OS 4 and 5 if you are interested in additional specifics.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Google app minutiae aside, that last portion is illuminating because OnePlus's rep was essentially saying to go to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/versions/5/features">"Explore Wear OS 5 features" page</a> on Android Developers. Unlike Samsung's unique version of One UI 6 Watch or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mobvoi.com/us/blog/Wear-OS-4-Upgrade-and-Enhanced-Functionality-for-TicWatch-Pro-5-Series?_id=66d6bfb9a743410012e83485&srsltid=AfmBOoprXT2-rUbgzYaxIkP0slEidkLhKrZf4KoBbjBFCRyz4Rn7gv-G">Mobvoi's specific update list for Wear OS 4</a>, OnePlus largely put its software update in Google's hands.</p><p>This isn't to say that the OnePlus Watch 3 software is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> clone. OnePlus has its UI quirks, video watch faces, and health features specific to the OHealth app, such as the 60-second health checkup tool.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BJeicXMMd2fC3PVqGZ59rg" name="oneplus-watch-3-phone-video-control" alt="The Short Video Control function on the OnePlus Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BJeicXMMd2fC3PVqGZ59rg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I did note one unique feature: You can prop up your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> and then swipe through TikTok or YouTube Shorts videos using your watch display. I have no idea how many people would want to navigate their feeds with their phones propped up, but at least OnePlus tried something new!</p><p>But by and large, OnePlus is offering a "stock" Wear OS experience, and some of its "new" Wear OS 5 features are things that were missing from its version of Wear OS 4, like emergency SOS, camera controls, and the ability to transfer your watch to a new phone.</p><p>I'm perfectly fine with OnePlus focusing on hardware and health upgrades with the Watch 3. It seems to have paid off, and compared to other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a> that work best within their ecosystem, I think you can wear this with just about any Android phone brand without missing any features because of the "stock" Wear OS approach.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="G8Kf9rkCF3cCrn95J9FVHL" name="oneplus-watch-3-60-second-health-check" alt="Using the new 60-second health check-in feature on a OnePlus Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/G8Kf9rkCF3cCrn95J9FVHL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now for the downsides: OnePlus says the Watch 3 will receive two OS updates — like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a> — and two years of bi-monthly security updates through early 2027. OnePlus committed to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-how-many-updates">three years of security updates</a> for the Watch 2, so we're not sure why OnePlus has apparently decided to cut back one year of support.</p><p>As for the OnePlus Watch 2, the OnePlus rep said that "Watch 2 users are expected to receive their OS 5 updates in Q3 of this year." That July–September stretch is when we'd expect the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Pixel Watch 4</a> to launch with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a>, meaning OnePlus will be a year behind them.</p><p>Up until this point, Wear OS brands like Xiaomi and Mobvoi have fallen a year behind Google and Samsung, only launching Wear OS 4 around Q3 2024. OnePlus obviously has a leg up by launching Wear OS 5 only half a year behind Samsung, but I'm not sure why the OnePlus Watch 2 — which has the same Snapdragon processor — would need another half a year or so.</p><p>At this point, I can only assume the year-long update gap between the Wear OS co-creators and third-party partners will never close. Samsung and Google had some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/long-wear-os-5-update-delay-feels-like-bad-sign">trouble updating their watches to Wear OS 5</a>, but nothing like what their partners have experienced.</p><p>General Wear OS trends aside, I'm not sure why the OnePlus Watch 3 will (presumably) stop receiving security updates well before it gets Wear OS 7 in late 2027. That seems a bit odd, and I'd like to think OnePlus will still provide <em>some</em> sporadic security support afterward, not just drop major changes and then ignore the Watch 3 entirely.</p><p>As it is, with Samsung and Google promising four and three years of support, respectively, OnePlus's two-year promise feels like the one potential blemish to an otherwise exciting OnePlus Watch 3 launch.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-112">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Hidden code in the latest Google TV Streamer update suggests built-in support for backlit remotes might be on the way.</li><li>Code reveals options for "Never," "Standard" (lights up for 5 seconds), and "Scheduled" (only from 6 PM to 6 AM).</li><li>It is being speculated that Google could be working on a premium remote that will support this feature.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The new Google TV Streamer update has some hidden code that points to built-in support for backlit remotes in the works, hinting at possible new hardware additions to the Google TV lineup.</p><p>While most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv">Google TV</a> devices stick with basic, non-backlit remotes, there are a few exceptions. A few <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-4k-tvs-chromecast">high-end TVs</a> with built-in Google TV and some models, like the Walmart Onn Pro, already come with backlit remotes. Still, getting them to work smoothly on Google TV usually means relying on custom tweaks from the manufacturers.</p><p>On the other hand, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv-streamer-review">Google TV Streamer</a> doesn’t come with a backlit remote, but it looks like Google might be tuning in to what users have been asking for.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.aftvnews.com/google-tv-is-gaining-native-remote-backlight-controls-could-a-new-premium-remote-be-coming/" target="_blank">AFTVNews</a>, the recent Google TV Streamer update includes code mentioning backlight support for compatible remotes (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-tv-settings-for-backlit-remotes/" target="_blank">Android Police</a>). The feature is tucked away in the Settings app code and isn’t accessible just yet.</p><p>Most Google TV devices come with basic, non-backlit remotes. It might seem like a small thing, but throw in some backlighting, and suddenly your late-night binge sessions get a whole lot easier.</p><p>The latest update reveals code for three backlight modes: "Never" (always off), "Standard" (lights up for five seconds after a button press), and "Scheduled" (same as Standard but only between 6 PM and 6 AM).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:580px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:58.10%;"><img id="Ett3gyUKUATJzBrTxVvfpg" name="Google-TV-backlit-remote-support" alt="strings of code in a Google TV Streamer update hinting at support for backlit remotes" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ett3gyUKUATJzBrTxVvfpg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="580" height="337" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AFTVNews)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>However, finding this feature in the code doesn’t mean it’s definitely coming. Plenty of times, stuff like this gets spotted but never actually makes it to users, or it takes forever to show up.</p><p>At present, backlit remotes on Google TV and Android TV depend on third-party manufacturers. The potential native support for this feature could make things easier for manufacturers and boost the availability of backlit remotes.</p><p>While these code changes hint at wider support for backlit remotes, it’s unclear if the Google TV Streamer will get in on the action. AFTVNews is tossing around the idea that Google might be working on a shiny new premium remote, which could be something to keep an eye on.</p>

Yes, there's a new Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset and other improvements, but Galaxy AI tricks and One UI 7's visual overhaul are just as crucial. To get the most out of your new Galaxy S25, you'll absolutely want to do these six things first.</p><p>Aside from the latest Galaxy AI tools, Samsung also made changes to One UI 7 that you'll want to customize to make your own. Whether you're a longtime Samsung user or you're new to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Galaxy phones</a>, this list highlights everything you need to try with your Galaxy S25 — and it covers the Galaxy S25, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-review">Galaxy S25 Plus</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>.</p>

<p>The very first thing you should do after setting up your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a> is check your lock screen notification settings. Samsung made a questionable change with One UI 7 on the Galaxy S25, making the default setting for lock screen notifications "Icons" rather than "Cards." Essentially, this means your phone will buzz and buzz by default while not showing notifications — with only minuscule status bar icons appearing.</p><p>To save you from pulling your hair out trying to figure out what's wrong, open up the <strong>Settings app</strong> and head over to the <strong>Notifications </strong>page. Tap <strong>Lock screen notifications</strong>, and pick either <strong>Dot</strong>, <strong>Icons</strong>, or <strong>Cards</strong>.</p>

<p>Any option is fine, but pay attention to the graphics that show how each setting will change how your notifications appear. Making this choice early can save a lot of headaches down the road. Pretty much every Samsung Galaxy S25 reviewer became initially confused by this perplexing tweak, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/this-one-change-almost-ruined-the-galaxy-s25-ultra-for-me">as we unpacked in-depth here</a>.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2RRfCrPeXza8RW2cdMpQaF" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-3" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy S25 outdoors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2RRfCrPeXza8RW2cdMpQaF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung introduced the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-set-up-use-now-bar-samsung-galaxy-phone"><strong>Now Bar</strong></a> and <strong>Now Brief</strong> with the Galaxy S25, and they dynamically change to show you the information you need throughout the day. By default, the Now Brief can be pretty sparse, only showing the weather and perhaps a news story or two. To make the Now Brief more unique to you, navigate to <strong>Galaxy AI</strong> > <strong>Now Brief </strong>in the Settings app.</p><p>The first option you'll see is a toggle called <strong>Expand Now Brief without unlocking</strong>, which makes the Now Brief accessible by tapping the Now Bar on your lock screen. However, some of the more helpful tweaks are under the <strong>Content to include</strong> tab. You can toggle each of the following Now Brief content types either on or off based on your preferences:</p>
<ul><li>Health and Wellness</li><li>Travel</li><li>Events and tasks</li><li>Routines</li><li>Digital Wellbeing</li><li>Communication</li><li>Moments</li><li>Gallery stories</li><li>Traffic updates</li><li>News</li><li>Smart home</li><li>Music and podcasts</li><li>YouTube Shorts</li></ul>
<p>This will help ensure the Now Brief is showing the things you want — and avoiding the things you don't. Like with any of these Galaxy AI features, personalization is key.</p>
<h2 id="3-create-gifs-with-ai-select-2">3. Create GIFs with AI Select</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="esQjsLPHXvRfKmB5amLHxX" name="ai-select-icons-sidebar-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra" alt="AI Select in sidebar on Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/esQjsLPHXvRfKmB5amLHxX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>GIFs are great for sharing on social media, but they're often hard to make without dedicated third-party tools. It's easy to make anything into a GIF with the Samsung Galaxy S25 using a feature called <strong>AI Select</strong>. Once you have something on your screen you want to use to make a GIF, swipe from the right of the screen to open the <strong>Edge panel</strong>. From there, tap <strong>AI Select</strong> at the top of the list.</p><p>Then, select something on your screen, and tap <strong>Create GIF</strong>. When you're ready, tap <strong>Record</strong>, and everything you do on your selected portion of your screen will become a GIF. You'll have 30 seconds to record, or you can press the <strong>Stop</strong> button to end things early.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6SwRSs8SWxdmiYm4oRDmkb" name="AI-Select-Create-GIF" alt="Creating a GIF with AI Select on the Samsung Galaxy S25." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6SwRSs8SWxdmiYm4oRDmkb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When you're finished, make sure you tap either the <strong>Copy</strong>, <strong>Share</strong>, or <strong>Download</strong> icons — GIFs aren't saved automatically. This is one of the more underrated features on the Samsung Galaxy S25 series. It's simple, but it makes turning a video into a GIF surprisingly easy.</p>

<p>Similar to AI Select, there's an AI Drawing Assist feature you'll want to use after getting started with your Galaxy S25. If you've used Sketch to Image, AI Drawing Assist will feel quite familiar. It's basically Sketch to Image but with multimodal input support. That means you can remix a photo with a drawing or text or generate an AI image from a note and text instructions.</p><p>The way it works is simple. You can access AI Drawing Assist from anywhere by swiping the <strong>Edge panel</strong> open, and tapping the third option in the list. After you select something, tap <strong>Drawing Assist</strong> and either draw or enter a text prompt of what you want to change. Then, tap <strong>Generate</strong> and watch Galaxy AI work its magic.</p>

<p>Aside from the system-wide version of AI Drawing Assist, there are versions build specifically for the Samsung Gallery and Notes apps. The good news is that whenever you want to create a generative AI image, you can call up AI Drawing Assist without leaving the app you're currently using.

<p>Google is rolling out a supercharged version of Gemini, and it debuted on the Galaxy S25. It can now take actions on your behalf, coordinating between multiple apps with multiple steps. Try asking Gemini something like "Find me a movie theater nearby and text the address to mom." Then, the revamped version of Gemini can use Google Maps and Google Messages to take those actions off your hands, which is something it couldn't do before.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> is also better at understanding what's on your screen and its context. For example, if you trigger Gemini while watching a YouTube video, you can use the <strong>Ask about screen</strong> button to have it respond to your prompt in the right context. If it's been a while since you gave Gemini a proper look, your new Galaxy S25 is a good reason to try it again.</p>

<p>We've long seen Google's Magic Eraser remove unwanted objects from photos, and Samsung may have took <em>slight</em> inspiration from that when it made the Object Eraser. Well, with the Galaxy S25, Samsung took a bit <em>more</em> inspiration from Google's Audio Magic Eraser. The Samsung Galaxy S25 offers a feature called Audio Eraser that can remove unwanted background noise from videos — and it'll even let you pick which sounds to erase.</p><p>In the Samsung Gallery app, you'll have the option of removing sounds like <strong>Voices</strong>, <strong>Noise</strong>, and <strong>Music</strong>. With a slider, you can adjust how aggressively Audio Eraser should mute these sounds. It's possible to compare the edited version to the original until you're pleased with the results. This could come in handy, especially in loud and crowded environments. If you want to play around with the feature on your new flagship, we have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-use-audio-eraser-on-the-samsung-galaxy-s25">complete guide to Audio Eraser here</a>.</p>

<p>It turns out that plenty of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> features Samsung added to the Galaxy S25 series are pretty neat. Throughout my time <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">reviewing the base Galaxy S25</a>, my favorite feature happened to be AI Select — creating GIFs has always been too difficult, and this phone makes it painless.</p><p>After you've tried out everything on this list — which applies to all Galaxy S25 models — there are a few more things you should check out if you have a Galaxy S25 Plus or Galaxy S25 Ultra. For starters, both of those <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-samsung-galaxy-s25-support-uwb">higher-end models support ultra-wideband (UWB)</a> for precision finding of item trackers, and use the ProScaler for QHD+.

<p>Okay, the headline might be a little harsh, but I feel like the Play Store has evolved (or devolved) into one of those massive indoor flea markets with every square inch packed to the point that it's spilled out into the parking lot with people setting up tables.</p><p>To continue this random but apt analogy, you'll head over and see the same stores that have been there for years. You'll also see a few newcomers who are trying to fit in while offering a bunch of goodies for cheap. Then, there are those who don't fully understand the concept of a "flea market" and are there for all of the wrong reasons.</p><p>This is pretty much how the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-apps">Play Store</a> shakes out, with many of the usual suspects holding ground in the "Top Charts." Occasionally, a new app or game will slowly (or quickly) arrive with a lot of excitement before nestling in with the rest and bumping others out. Then, we have the nefarious apps. The ones that have a nice coat of paint, but are only there to either drain your Play Store balance or worse.</p><p>Thankfully, there are a few trusted Play Store alternatives that I've been enjoying to help make finding apps exciting again.</p>

<p>My first problem comes with actually finding apps. As of early February 2025, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://42matters.com/google-play-statistics-and-trends">42matters claims</a> there are almost 2.1 million apps on the Play Store. Apparently, more than 1,100 new apps are published every day, with an average of almost 42,000 apps arriving every month. This brings me to my first issue with the Play Store — search.</p><p>How is it that a search engine can be so bad at search? Sure, it works fine if you know the name of the app that you're looking for. But try to search for "KWGT" or "icon packs." You'll get plenty of results, but there's no rhyme or reason for how the options are displayed. And it's not like you can just sort by "recently updated" or by the highest rating.</p><p>Of course, this problem really only surfaces when searching for more broad terms, but it's still something that drives me crazy. It also drives me crazy that, with some app listings, it's practically impossible to see the last time that it was updated.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="EWhvh7FUSaHBrtsrkQQgF5" name="play-pass-halls-of-torment-pokemon-silver-s25-ultra-odin-2-pocket-dmg" alt="Play Pass on the S25 Ultra with Halls of Torment on the Odin 2 and Pokemon Silver on the Pocket DMG" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EWhvh7FUSaHBrtsrkQQgF5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Speaking of which, I can't tell you how many times I've gone to open and use an app, only to have to wait for it to be updated, despite the fact that it <em>should have been</em> updated overnight while my phone was charging and while I was asleep. No, it's not some game-breaking problem, but if I check the box for an app or my phone to do something, I expect it to be done.</p><p>Oh, and don't even get me started on games. One of the biggest reasons why I'm still subscribed to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-games-google-play-pass">Play Pass</a> is that it surfaces games that aren't just looking for ways to extract as much patience and money from me as possible. Which is exactly what most of the "Top Charts" consist of anymore. It's not entirely Google's fault, but both Apple and Google are a bit to blame here.</p>

<p>Wouldn't ya know, for the 2.1 million apps on the Play Store, there's a whole world of apps that are available. Many of which are FOSS or "free and open source software," and are just a few taps away.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://f-droid.org/en/">F-Droid</a> is probably something you've heard of before, as it's essentially the Play Store for FOSS apps. The only "catch" is that you first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-sideloading">need to sideload</a> the F-Droid app or one of the clients like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/NeoApplications/Neo-Store">Neo Store</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/Droid-ify/client/releases">Droid-ify</a>. And honestly, you'll probably want to try out Neo Store or Droid-ify because the F-Droid app itself looks rather archaic.</p>

<p>This is where my anti-Play Store journey began, as there really are a lot of fantastic open-source apps that don't get the recognition they deserve. Yes, there's a lot more digging and nuance involved, but in the end, it's well worth it.</p><p>But what if you're like me and have a curated list of open-source apps that you want to download and keep updated? Well, that's where Obtainium comes in.</p>

<p>I first learned about Obtainium early last year, as I was expanding my knowledge of retro gaming on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">Android handhelds</a>. See, there are a decent number of recommended and reliable emulators on the Play Store, but there are even more that aren't. At the time, this was before <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/nintendo-stikes-major-blow-android-emulators">Nintendo wrecked Switch emulation</a>, so Obtainium made it easy to keep Yuzu and its forks updated.</p><p>With Obtainium, you're able to bypass F-Droid or the Play Store and get apps and updates directly from the source. However, there are "over a dozen source websites, including GitHub, GitLab, and F-Droid."</p><p>The process of adding apps can still be tedious, especially if the majority of them come from GitHub and you end up bumping up against the rate limit. That can be solved by signing up for a GitHub and/or GitLab account and generating a Personal Access Token that is added to Obtainium.</p><p>However, there's also a solution to being able to keep the list of apps across devices, without needing to manually add them every time. Obtainium lets you export the list of apps that you've curated, complete with any specific information that you've added such as the name or category. So as long as you keep the exported JSON file backed up, you can just download Obtainium and import the list when you get a new Android device.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="X5MLwehvqGcnp2ZecisgC5" name="obtainium-updates-notification-odin-2" alt="Update notification from Obtainium on the Odin 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/X5MLwehvqGcnp2ZecisgC5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The fun doesn't stop there, however, as you can also add things and set them to "Track-Only." With this, you'll be notified when there's a new release, but it's not actually an app that can be downloaded. I use this to keep track of when new drivers are released, along with tracking multiple forks of the same app.</p><p>Because I've been getting more and more open-source apps, and not just the ones on Android, I've also started using GitHub more and more. So, when I learned that I could create a repo and upload my exported list of apps, I got pretty excited.</p><p>This way, I don't have to try to remember what cloud storage service I uploaded it to while keeping my "open source world" tied together quite nicely. Plus, there are a bunch of "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apps.obtainium.imranr.dev/">crowdsourced app configurations</a>" that can be added with just a couple of taps.</p><p>Look, I know that this isn't a path that many will venture down, and it's okay if you don't really have issues with the Play Store. But if you're like me and want something better, and that gives you more control, definitely check out Obtainium.</p>

<ul><li>Google’s Teams-to-Chat migration tool is now fully live for everyone.</li><li>Workspace admins can move entire Teams chat histories to Google Chat.</li><li>Migration requires linking a Microsoft account and uploading CSV files for channels and user mapping.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google recently introduced a new tool that makes switching from Microsoft Teams to Google Chat a breeze, and it’s now open to everyone.</p><p>After rolling out in open beta last December, Google’s Microsoft Teams to Google Chat migration tool is now fully live. A recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/02/release-notes-02-14-2025.html" target="_blank">blog post</a> confirms that Workspace admins can now move entire Teams chat histories over to Google Chat (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/google-chat-wants-to-help-you-dump-microsoft-teams-for-good" target="_blank">TechRadar</a>).</p><p>First, link up your Microsoft account to start the migration process. You’ll need to upload a CSV file with the list of Teams channels you want to move over. If you’ve got specific email addresses in Teams that need to match up with Google Chat, you can toss in a second CSV file to map those out.</p><p>Keep in mind that the migration only works if the users already have accounts in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/everything-you-need-know-about-google-workspace-spaces-and-smart-canvas">Google Workspace</a> and have Google Chat enabled. Once that’s sorted, pick the starting date for the messages you want to bring over. Hit go, and the tool will start moving your data.</p><p>When it’s done, all your migrated spaces, messages, and chat history will be live and ready for the right users in Google Workspace.</p><p>After the migration wraps up, admins can access detailed reports that highlight any hiccups like skipped content, errors, or warnings that popped up along the way.</p>

<p>Workspace admins can start moving Teams chat data over to Google Chat right away. And if you’re looking to shift other types of data from different services, Google’s got your back with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/6003169" target="_blank">helpful guides</a>.</p><p>Only folks who have both Google Super Admin and Microsoft Teams Global Admin roles can pull off this migration.</p><p>If your organization is stuck using both platforms (or other tools), <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chat-now-works-with-slack-and-microsoft-teams">Mio can help make them play nice together</a>, as per TechRadar.

"Gemini is now available as its own app, and that’s now the best place to use Gemini.

<ul><li>Your Pixel Watch will now require an extra step to trigger an Emergency SOS call following an update.</li><li>After pressing the Pixel Watch crown five times, you'll need to hold the screen for three seconds to complete a call.</li><li>This tweak is designed to avoid accidental triggers, and can be modified in your Pixel Watch settings manually.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Emergency SOS is a life-saving feature on wearables like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Google Pixel Watch</a>, but it runs the risk of diverting resources from real emergencies due to accidental triggers. As such, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-emergency-sos-confirmation-update-explained">Google announced last month</a> that it would be adding an extra step to the Emergency SOS process in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelwatch/thread/320517148/emergency-sos-with-touch-and-hold-confirmation-on-pixel-watch" target="_blank">community post</a>. Now, this change appears to be widely available on Pixel Watch following an update.</p><p>An updated version of the Personal Safety app for Wear OS, carrying version number <strong>2025.01.23.721858245.2-release-wear</strong>, brings the change to all Pixel Watch models in supported regions (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/18/pixel-watch-emergency-sos-update/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.safetyhub&pli=1" target="_blank">Google Play Store</a> listing for the app has also been updated to reflect this tweak, and notes that the Personal Safety app for Android phones also has the extra step for Emergency SOS.</p><p>By default, pressing the Pixel Watch crown five times consecutively or more will call up the Emergency SOS screen — but you'll now need to touch and hold the Pixel Watch screen for three seconds to start a call with emergency services. If you don't complete the "press and hold" requirement within 20 seconds, the Emergency SOS screen will be closed automatically to avoid accidentally triggering a call.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:460px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="X99Y9qMiArtmSHStsGXHXM" name="Emergency-SOS-Updated" alt="The updated Emergency SOS screens for Pixel Watch." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/X99Y9qMiArtmSHStsGXHXM.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="460" height="460" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The change is designed to make it "less likely to accidentally trigger an Emergency SOS call during activities like exercise, while ensuring fast and easy access to initiate a call when you need it the most," the company explained in the original community post.</p><p>Google is also making it optional to manually set your Pixel Watch to call emergency services after a five-second countdown, eliminating the "touch and hold" requirement. Users can change this by opening up the settings on their Pixel Watch,  and navigating to <strong>Safety and emergency</strong> > <strong>Emergency SOS</strong>. From there, tap<strong> Ways to start SOS</strong> and choose<strong> Automatically call</strong>.</p><p>Per usual, the feature requires location sharing and a network connection, and is limited to supported countries and regions.

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-132">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Nothing will offer a 50MP periscope telephoto lens on the Phone 3a series, in a first for the company.</li><li>The Nothing Phone 3a will offer four cameras total, with three being 50MP sensors.</li><li>The main and front-facing cameras support 4K video recording.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>In typical Nothing fashion, the company is teasing its way toward the official launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-camera-button-official-teaser">Nothing Phone 3a series</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-series-launch-quarterly-update-confirmed">which will happen Tuesday, March 4</a>. Ahead of that unveiling, Nothing gave fans a preview of the Nothing Phone 3a camera system in a YouTube video comparing it to the latest iPhone 16 camera system. Notably, it includes a few major upgrades over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Phone 2a lineup</a>.</p><p>Nothing says that the Phone 3a series will have a 50MP main camera sensor, which is designed to capture more light and more detail than its predecessor. That's one of three camera sensors on the Phone 3a with a 50MP size. You'll also get a 50MP front-facing camera and a 50MP rear periscope telephoto lens.</p><p>That last bit is important, because we don't often see high-quality telephoto cameras on midrange phones. The 50MP periscope telephoto lens on the Nothing Phone 3a is said to offer 3x optical zoom, plus 6x "in-sensor zoom" — which likely uses sensor crop to provide optical-quality detail via digital zoom. It's also aiming to deliver "60x ultra zoom" on the Phone 3a.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_D_btmdrP9M" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>The final rear camera on the Nothing Phone 3a is an 8MP ultrawide camera. As such, the Phone 3a's camera arsenal will include a 50MP main sensor, a 50MP telephoto lens, and an 8MP ultrawide camera on the rear. Then, there will be a 50MP front-facing camera to round out the offerings. On paper, it seems to be a standout camera system for a midrange device.</p><p>Nothing adds that all four cameras support Ultra HDR for photos, with the main and front-facing cameras adding 4K recording with stabilization. There's also what Nothing calls the "TrueLens Engine 3.0," which "harnesses elite hardware to produce professional-grade, true-to-life photography through a combination of AI tone mapping and scene detection" and "understands every image and tunes it to strike a classic photographic balance with next-generation computational technology."</p><p>This isn't the first time Nothing has teased out Phone 3a details. It previously <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-qualcomm-soc-teaser-ceo-announcement">teased a return to a Qualcomm Snapdragon chip</a> for the lineup. For more, we'll have to wait until the official Phone 3a reveal on March 4.</p>

<ul><li>A tipster discovered code in the Google app's recent version, pointing toward a new auto-summary feature for Gemini Live.</li><li>The AI is supposedly preparing to support for summaries at the end of chats that are brief and straight to the point with titles and bullet points.</li><li>Gemini Live recently received file and image support on the Galaxy S25 series, as well as an update that improved its translation skills.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is reportedly preparing an update to Gemini that brings a little more convenience to its conversational uses.</p><p>The upcoming changes were spotted by AssembleDebug (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/gemini-live-conversation-summaries-apk-3526918/">Android Authority</a>), who states Gemini Live could receive a chat "summarization" feature. In an APK dive of the Google app v16.6.23, the tipster states Google has added Gemini Live support for "automatic" chat summaries. These summaries will allegedly follow that same bite-sized trend of how Gemini Live delivers information to regular queries.</p><p>The post states Google's support for auto-summaries will "direct" Gemini Live to display content in a "brief, paragraph-style." The summaries will be broken down into titled, bullet point sections with short, one sentence explainers for users.</p><p>This is all contained in an overall section, which Gemini Live will supposedly give a title and brief overview about before delivering specific details. From the example, it seems Gemini Live will even resurface what it asked you (things about your interest or for extra context).</p><p>The APK dive didn't expand on whether Gemini Live's recent file support will be included in its automatic chat summaries.</p><p>The tipster also presumes Google could provide this automatic summarization feature at the end of Gemini Live chats.</p>

<p>Google's AI model has had a few notable updates recently, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-allows-users-to-share-images-files-youtube-videos-to-gemini-live">beginning with one</a> that launched with the Galaxy S25 series. In January, users could begin submitting files, images, and YouTube videos to Gemini Live for feedback/information. For photos, users can submit one and ask "how's my composition?" Gemini Live will provide assistance for making it better and praise you for what looks good.</p><p>During its debut, Google highlighted that it's working to bring <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-project-astra-ar-waitlist-opens-trusted-testers">Project Astra's</a> capabilities to the AI assistant, such as screen sharing and video streaming.</p><p>Further, in February, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-updates-gemini-live-plans-screen-sharing-and-live-video-support">Gemini Live's update</a> brought an expansion of Google's intentions to make its conversational experience more "dynamic." The model received additional support for multiple languages, dialects, and accents. Again, the company previewed its upcoming screen sharing and video streaming capabilities, to which it highlighted changes to its data sharing.</p><p>Google states "As part of providing this improved experience, your audio, video, and screenshares are stored in your Gemini Apps Activity (if it’s on)."</p>

<p>Meta Connect 2025 begins on September 17, 2025. The 5th annual Meta conference will focus on Meta Quest headsets, AI glasses, and other AI developments. But you won't have to wait until the fall to learn more about Meta AI.</p><p>In the same Tuesday reveal, Meta announced LlamaCon, a developer conference focused on their open-source AI, Llama. It takes place on April 29, and Meta says it will share "the latest on our open source AI developments" to help devs "build amazing apps and products, whether as a start-up or at scale."</p><p>On Threads, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg shared this news, listing both dates and saying, "LlamaCon is a new event for developers building with Llama.

<p>We know from recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-q4-2024-earnings">Meta earnings</a> that the latest Llama 4 version should arrive soon, and that the company intends to spend a massive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-plans-to-spend-billions-on-ai-2025">$65 billion on AI in 2025</a>. A conference dedicated to announcing the new version and jumpstarting dev engagement with their Llama platform makes sense for Meta.</p><p>Meta has said the new Llama 4 will enable "a host of new product innovation in areas like speech and reasoning" in order to make Meta AI more voice-based, and that pivot will be an important one before Meta Connect 2025, which we believe will focus primarily on AI glasses.</p>

That same leak indicated that Meta is working on $1,000 "Hypernova" smart glasses with a HUD for showing notifications and Meta AI info; <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/meta/603674/meta-ray-ban-smart-glasses-sales">The Verge</a> suggests they intend to sell them in 2025, making Connect 2025 a likely candidate to show them off.</p><p>We may also see more of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-semg-wristband-whitepaper">EMG wristband</a> that reads your neural signals and interprets them for gesture controls for smart glasses.

<ul><li>An X tipster claims the Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Fold 7 could grab "highly efficient" displays to help improve battery life.</li><li>The Flip 7 is rumored to stick with its old 25W charger, but it could see new "flexible glass" to help reduce its crease presence.</li><li>A Fold 7 prototype is rumored to feature a 200MP primary lens.</li><li>Recent reports claim Samsung is working to bring much larger batteries to the future of Galaxy phones, which could begin in 2026.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung's next foldables are expected later this summer, but these new rumors purport a positive upgrade.</p><p>A post by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Fold7-and-Galaxy-Z-Flip7-with-significantly-more-efficient-displays-Leaker-names-key-features-and-highlights.962127.0.html">NotebookCheck</a> highlighted a post by X tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/PandaFlashPro/status/1890286598627234114">PandaFlash</a>, which rolled through some supposed Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Fold 7 changes (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-phones/the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-could-have-better-battery-life-but-not-for-the-reason-you-might-expect">TechRadar</a>). According to the tipster, both foldables will see a "longer battery life" as they "consume less power" thanks to a Samsung display change. The tipster says this "highly efficient" tech change should aid both devices in lasting longer for users scrolling or gaming.</p><p>Supposedly, a test was conducted with the Fold 7, showing that it lasted roughly 55 minutes more with this new screen tech alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-soc-for-galaxy-s25-series">Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a>.</p><p>The tipster moved into some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="">rumored Flip 7-specific specs</a>, stating Samsung has "improved its hinge durability." The clamshell could see a slightly thinner body, "all-new flexible glass," which could lead to its supposed "less visible crease" compared to the next Fold. Samsung is rumored to have improved the Flip 7's charging speed, despite it's stagnant 25W charger.</p><p>PandaFlash claims the Fold 7 will see a 200MP primary camera and a slightly thinner build, too. This is supposedly based on a "prototype" of the book-style device.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">"Confirmed"Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Galaxy Z Flip 7 Displays are Highly Efficient, Consuming less Power and offering longer battery life.Galaxy Z Fold 7 Test Battery backup is increased around 55minutes, with Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy.<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1890286598627234114">February 14, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Samsung may prefer to stick with the same battery and charger for its foldables, but improve on that foundation, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/major-galaxy-s25-ultra-battery-charging-test-highlighted">kind of like its Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>. The Korean OEM stuck with the same battery and 45W charging for its recent Ultra; however, a test showed the company quickened its 0% to 70% and 0% to 100% charging times over the S24 Ultra. We'll have to wait and see if the improvements given (if they happen) are enough to warrant the same old, same old.</p><p>There <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-future-galaxy-s-phones-battery-charging-rumors">is a report</a> that Samsung is interested in (finally) upgrading its Galaxy phone battery tech in the future, potentially reaching 6,000mAh to 7,000mAh capacities.</p><p>Recent Flip 7 and Fold 7 rumors state the company could give the devices <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-might-finally-give-the-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-flip-7-the-screen-upgrades-they-need">a display upgrade</a> they've been craving — aside from the supposed "efficiency" swap. The Flip 7 could see a 6.8-inch internal display and a 4-inch cover screen. The Fold 7 could grab a bigger 8-inch main screen and a 6.5-inch cover. This is another area that Samsung has become pretty stale in so, hopefuly, this one proves true.</p><p>Tipster highlighted the Flip 7 and its cameras, claiming that consumers <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/early-alleged-galaxy-z-flip-7-camera-specs-detailed">might not get too excited</a> about them this year.</p>

<ul><li>A German publication claims to have obtained the Pixel 9a's specs, stating it will feature a 6.3-inch OLED display with a max 120Hz refresh rate.</li><li>The device is rumored again to feature a dual camera array with a 48MP primary lens and a 13MP ultrawide lens and the Tensor G4 SoC.</li><li>Many of these rumors double down on what we've seen previously; however, the Pixel 9a could see a price hike in the U.S. as it rises to $499 at start.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The leaks keep coming as another report claims to have revealed the specs of Google's upcoming budget Pixel.</p><p>The company's affordable Pixel 9a reportedly had its specifications leaked by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,148929.html">WinFuture</a> (German). The publication cites "available technical data," stating the Pixel 9a could hit the market with a 6.3-inch OLED display with a max 120Hz refresh rate. The panel allegedly supports HDR10 Plus, as well. The post includes a rumored look at the device in four colors; however, the highlight is this screen's bezels.</p><p>A glance suggests the Pixel 9a will have slightly thicker bezels compared to the flagship Pixel 9 series. The phone's leaked renders show a completely flat screen and sides alongside rounded corners — which stays within Google's theme.</p><p>The back is another area where we could see change as rumors continue to claim there's a dual-camera array in our future. Of course, this is similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">base Pixel 9</a>; however, the Pixel 9a could see a 48MP primary lens with OIS (optical image stabilization) and a 13MP ultrawide lens. These lenses contrast the vanilla Pixel 9's 50MP and 48MP alternatives.</p><p>What's more, the housing array is in focus as Google may drop the thick, protruding camera visor on the Pixel 9a. The renderings claim the array will be minimal and flush to the back panel for a near-flat surface.</p>

<p>Rumors add the phone may debut with a 5,100mAh battery, as well as a 128GB and a 256GB storage option with 8GB RAM across both. Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a>, which is packed into the flagship Pixel 9 series, is expected to power the Pixel 9a. Once again, the post reiterates colors we've seen before, like Obsidian, Porcelain, Peony, and Iris.</p><p>Lastly, the publication suggests the Pixel 9a could see a starting price of €499 in Europe (~$520).</p><p>The alleged specs of the Pixel 9a have been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-leak-reveal-every-last-spec-of-the-handset">surfacing since December</a>, which is when we first got a glimpse of its potential contents. The current rumors double down on several aspects such as its 6.3-inch display, color options, usage of the Tensor G4, and primary camera strength. Curiously, the leaked pricing from last year claims the U.S. could see the same price tag as what's rumored for Europe: $499 for its base model. A rumored <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-storage-options-leak">price hike was stated </a>for the larger 256GB option.</p><p>Regarding the renders, we've seen similar aesthetics and designs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/massive-pixel-9a-leak-reveals-official-looking-renders-color-options">leaked before</a> and those have remained consistent through the latest ones.</p><p>Google typically unveils the current series' A-series phone the following year (toward the spring) and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-google-pixel-9as-exact-release-date-is-already-known-report-claims">recent rumors state</a> that could happen again. Speculation claims Google is preparing for a March 26 debut for the Pixel 9a with pre-orders opening one week beforehand (around March 19).</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Garmin <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/newsroom/press-release/outdoor/garmin-unveils-tactix-8-smartwatch-stay-active-stay-mission-ready/">unveiled</a> its new Tactix 8 watch last Thursday, designed specifically for military and reserve service members. One new, long-awaited feature is a "rucking" mode that lets you "input pack weight to better understand the physical exertion associated with rucking." And I'm already thinking about how Garmin can upgrade this feature.</p><p>Despite its origins in military training, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/rucking-workout-fad-is-fun-novelty-but-not-for-everyone">rucking</a> has grown as a civilian workout fad in recent years — carrying extra weight on hikes to build muscle and elevate your heart rate for extra training load — and I fully expect this mode to come to other Garmin watches in 2025 once the Tactix 8 gets its exclusivity window.</p><p>Whether or not you use the "Rucking" sport profile, Garmin has added a "pack weight feature" that lets you input how much weight you're carrying for other popular activities like trail running, hiking, and walking. Garmin says that any activity carrying 2kg or more will be disabled for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-i-boosted-my-vo2-max-score-on-my-garmin-watch">VO2 Max</a> recording.</p><p>While that might sound disappointing at first glance, this is a much-needed adjustment. Depending on your pack weight, your heart rate will climb into higher HR zones, especially on hills. With no context, my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a> would assume I'm in in worse shape than its algorithm originally suggested, and lower my VO2 Max.</p><p>I feared that rucking or adding pack weight wouldn't give me <em>any</em> training load because of this. Thankfully, a Garmin rep told me that, while "there is no direct adjustment to training load" when weight is added, "load would indirectly be affected by carrying weight due to HR inevitably being higher."</p><p>In other words, Garmin's Training Status and Training Readiness would still take a difficult workout into account, judging you to be overtraining if a hard rucking workout overtaxed your heart long enough to need rest. And you'll still get <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-training-load-focus-needs-one-obvious-fix">training load</a> credit. You'll just have to wait for your next non-weighted activity to try and raise your VO2 Max.</p>

<p>I'm eagerly anticipating this feature coming to watches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Garmin Fenix 8</a>, and <em>hope</em> the company won't restrict such an essential tool from the mid-range or lower-end models like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-cant-decide-if-the-garmin-instinct-3-is-a-triumph-or-a-letdown">Garmin Instinct 3</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-165-review">Forerunner 165</a>. Garmin said they "cannot comment on a potential future roadmap" for this feature or others, but its watches usually get updated every quarter.</p><p>I know what you're thinking: If I'm excited about this and think Garmin went about adding rucking and pack weight the right way, what's the "upgrade" I'm already demanding from Garmin?</p><p>Garmin users will know of two recent metrics added to high-end models like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Forerunner 965</a>: Endurance Score and Hill Score. They both translate more generalized metrics like TL and VO2 Max into practical measurements of how your theoretical fitness level translates into real-world ability. The more you can sustain your pace for long paces or sprint up hills without a break, the higher your score.</p><p>My suggestion sounds simple, but might be challenging to pull off. I want a Pack Score, or a Grit Score, or maybe even a Muscle Score? I don't know what Garmin would call it; I simply know that it'd be awesome for Garmin to measure your muscular and cardiovascular ability to bear certain weights over time.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="saVs5xFzRFWuEhLLsVUrtJ" name="Garmin-Forerunner-965-endurance-score-chart.jpeg" alt="Endurance score on the Garmin Forerunner 965" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/saVs5xFzRFWuEhLLsVUrtJ.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Imagine Garmin's Endurance Score graph, only it judges your ability to handle heavier weights. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Garmin knows (via your VO2 Max and Hill/Endurance Scores) what your heart rate should be at any given pace, distance, or elevation gain. So if you start an activity with 10 pounds of weight, it should be able to compare your rucking HR against your <em>normal</em> HR and judge how well your body is bearing the weight.</p><p>I'd imagine that to get a Garmin rucking score, your watch would need you to bear a certain threshold of weight for a long enough stretch for it to determine your abilities. For future activities, bearing more weight might boost your score, but only if the weight doesn't push your HR too far from your VO2 Max baseline.</p><p>Over time, your Garmin rucking score would improve by three metrics: increasing your VO2 Max to handle the cardiovascular workload, decreasing the gap between your baseline HR and your weight-bearing HR, and increasing your max pack weight.</p><p>With enough data, Garmin's algorithm could determine your body's recommended pack weight range, with suggested activity lengths or Garmin Strength Coach workouts that could target the weight-bearing muscles necessary to improve.</p><p>Rucking enthusiasts don't necessarily need validation from a smartwatch; they know how much weight they can bear. But for anyone new to the sport, a Garmin rucking score that judges your abilities and warns you away from pushing too hard until you're ready could be extremely useful!</p><p>Garmin says "there is currently no additional tracking regarding judging your ability to adapt to heavier weights," and I can't predict if Garmin has any plans in this area; perhaps rucking is too niche for them to put in that much effort on a new algorithm. For now, I'll focus on my more immediate hope: that more Garmin watches get this cool new rucking activity!</p>

<p>Purchase the new Samsung Galaxy S25 alongside a year of the Unlimited plan at Mint Mobile and you'll get a straight $200 carved off the phone, plus the price of wireless will drop to only $180 ($15 per month). Both the <a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus/8666602/"><strong>Galaxy S25 Plus</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra/8666710/"><strong>S25 Ultra</strong></a> are getting the same deal as the base model S25, so you can choose the version that's right for you. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/samsung-galaxy-s25/8666515/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="47efc0d1-f5ee-4082-a6be-95c9377c156a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$800" data-dimension48="$800">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want the latest Samsung phone at the best price possible without a trade-in; you&apos;d like to save money on your phone bill in 2025. </p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you don&apos;t want to commit to one wireless carrier for a full year; you&apos;re looking for a trade-in opportunity.<strong> </strong></p><p>This deal also comes in the wake of Mint Mobile&apos;s confirmation that it will soon be removing the data cap from its Unlimited plan. Although the Unlimited tier already ranked among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/best-unlimited-data-plans">best unlimited plans</a> in the business, the 40GB cap meant that heavy data users couldn&apos;t get the most out of their Mint Mobile service. Thanks to this update, however, the plan will soon get you truly unlimited talk, text, and data on T-Mobile&apos;s vast 5G network, along with a free mobile hotspot, free calls to Mexico and Canada, and Wi-Fi calling support. </p><p>The phones you&apos;re getting out of the deal are no slouch, either. All three devices in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy S25 lineup</a> are powered by the custom Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, plus you get a suite of new Galaxy AI software features, a sophisticated Gorilla Glass Victus 2 construction, and seven years of OS/security updates guaranteed. </p>

<p>Our furry companions are more than just pets; they're family. Don't you find yourself wishing you could call and check on your dog sometimes? Say you're at work or school and wondering whether your puppy is missing you. Enabot created a clever pet tracker with two-way communications embedded into it, turning this dream into reality for all of us.</p><p>The Enabot ROLA PetTracker has other merits as well, including GPS positioning, health tracking, and more. I found the $99 retail price tag very compelling after running tests on this handy pet camera slash tracker.</p><p>Right off the bat, I'll say this, though: while it's advertised for both cats and dogs, the Enabot ROLA PetTracker is simply too big for most kitties.</p>

<p>If you aren't already familiar with the brand, Enabot's specialty is making smart vacuum-inspired pet robots like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/enabot-ebo-x-review">EBO X</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/enabot-rolapet-petpal-hands-on">RolaPet PetPal</a>. Having mastered just the right set of skills needed for tracking and communicating with pets at home, the brand ported those features over to a more compact and mobile form factor with the ROLA PetTracker.</p><p>In essence, the ROLA PetTracker is like any other GPS tracker for your dog. There's a SIM slot for a data SIM, which enables you to track your pet in real-time, and there's a companion app where you can manage all this. But the similarities between commonplace GPS dog trackers and the ROLA PetTracker end there.</p><p>Enabot added mics and a speaker to the ROLA PetTracker so you can talk to your fur baby at any given point of the day. Both the speaker and mic can be enabled or disabled via the Rola app for Android or iOS.</p><p>However, the more impressive feat achieved by this tracker isn't its quadruple positioning system or two-way comms. It's the humble 480p camera and clever additions like a flashlight, an SOS button, and splash-proofing that make this tracker innovative.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this trial, I enlisted the help of five-month-old Rosa, a mid-sized German Shepherd mix who loves to live her best life unapologetically, every single day. This adorable menace served as the perfect test subject for the ROLA PetTracker.</p><p>The purpose of my testing was twofold. Firstly, I wanted to see whether the ROLA PetTracker can actually do the tasks advertised in the wild. And secondly, I aimed to gauge whether it's really worth investing in.</p><p>Enabot includes a harness with one mount each for both cats and dogs in the box. There's also a really small silicone collar included in there, which can't possibly fit any canine's neck without strangling it.</p><p>The idea behind the harness was good, and it was comfy as well, but it was executed poorly. The harness' flawed design lacks buckles to secure the adjusted straps in place, which caused the harness to keep slipping off of poor Rosa during our walk.</p>

<p>During the walk, the Enabot ROLA PetTracker slipped off and fell into puddles quite a few times. Thanks to its splash-proofing, I was able to rinse the camera off and it was good as new later.</p><p>The fickle nature of the harness caused a lot of trouble for both Rosa and me during our excursion. She kept entangling herself between the leash and the harness. It's such a shame because I was really looking forward to capturing her shenanigans from her POV in the harness-mounted videos.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Te3TWpXCYXuLxCdTP6NPrh" name="Enabot ROLA PetTracker" alt="Enabot ROLA PetTracker" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Te3TWpXCYXuLxCdTP6NPrh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I also used this opportunity outdoors to test the comms system, which worked seamlessly. Initially, Rosa was quite shocked when I used the mic and speaker to talk to her. She got used to it pretty quickly, though, and listened diligently to any commands issued.</p><p>The SOS button functions as it should and in case the battery on the tracker dies, there's a QR code printed on the ROLA PetTracker that can be scanned by others. Although the 480p camera isn't of the best quality and lacks night vision, the flashlight mitigates some of those issues.</p><p>Enabot also incorporated health-tracking metrics into the ROLA PetTracker. Not only can you log your pet's steps and record how much exercise they're getting, but you can also track individual walks using the GPS to see where you walked, when, for how long, and how many steps were taken by your pet in that duration. It's superb, really!</p><p>On top of that, the tracker leverages the camera, GPS, and two-way audio by enabling you to set up a virtual fence for your dog. Any time it ventures beyond your customized radius, you get an alert on your phone, and if you want, so does the dog via sound notification. The virtual fence with sound prompts is an awesomely humane way to train dogs not to stray too far away from home.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="m4MSWsTnC4yAcQw8rmJqkh" name="Enabot ROLA PetTracker" alt="Enabot ROLA PetTracker" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/m4MSWsTnC4yAcQw8rmJqkh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Knowing where your dog was when you took it for a walk has several benefits. In the event that you lose your furry friend, drop its toy somewhere, or suspect it ate something funny, being able to retrace its footsteps could save your dog's life!</p><p>All in all, the ROLA PetTracker delivers fantastic value. You get a very good price for something this feature-rich, plus it goes on sale regularly, dropping the price from an amicable $99 to a budget-friendly $79. It's a comprehensive tool that's excellent for pet health management and monitoring health metrics such as your dog's weight, steps, and exercise.</p><p>The water-repellent design can survive a good few splashes but not submersion. Dogs are messy, so I fear it won't do as well against mud and dirtier elements. However, just having splash-proofing is a bonus for a product like this.</p><p>Perhaps the only thing that I'd want to be done better — apart from the harness and tight collar — would be battery longevity. You recharge the Enabot ROLA PetTracker using a USB-C cable and charger, which is incredibly convenient, but the battery doesn't last more than a few days. So, you need to remember to charge it frequently.</p><p>There's really no other pet tracker on the market that's this lightweight and compact, this cheap, and this useful. If you like keeping a close watch on your beloved pups, I highly recommend it.</p>

<hr>
<p>OnePlus has launched its latest smartwatch, the Watch 3 today (Feb 18), and it debuts with the all-new WearOS 5 in the U.S. and Canada.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-hands-on">OnePlus Watch 3 </a>arrives with a tough stainless steel exterior and a Titanium PVD (Physical Vapor Deposition) bezel that protects the smartwatch against corrosion. When it comes to the display, the smartwatch gets a 1.5-inch LTPO flexible display made of 2D Sapphire Crystal that helps keep the look intact through life's wear and tear including environmental stressors.</p><p>Like any other smartphone on the market, OnePlus was able to give this wearable an IP68 rating which allows the device to be submerged in 1.5 meters of freshwater for up to 30 minutes. The 5ATM gives the watch a water resistance of 50 meters, meaning it could be your companion while you're at the beach, in the desert, or swimming.</p><p>Coming to the heart that powers this watch, the OnePlus Watch 3 is said to be powered by two separate chipsets — the Snapdragon W5 and the new BES2800 MCU Efficiency chipset. Snapdragon W5 accomplishes complex tasks, such as running Google apps, the latter is for the background activities and tasks.</p><p>With this dual chipset, the company says that "it not only enhances its operating speed but also significantly reduces power consumption, resulting in extended battery life." OnePlus adds that this setup will also allow users to "seamlessly switch between the two wearable operating systems and chipsets."</p>

<p>OnePlus always tries to reach for the stars when it comes to the battery life of their wearable. With the Watch 3, the company takes it a step further from its predecessor, it claims that the smartwatch will have three days' worth of battery when used in a 'heavy mode', a five-day life in Smart mode, and a whopping 16 days' worth of battery life in power saver mode. The smartwatch comes with an increased capacity of 631mAh and sports the OnePlus Silicon NanoStack Battery similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>.</p><p>With the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5"> WearOS 5</a> comes renewed health monitoring capabilities of the Watch 3, which is said to track key health metrics that not only focus on physical health but also the mental well-being of the individual,  like heart rate, SpO2, vascular health, wrist temperature, and sleep. The OnePlus Watch 3 comes with a new feature called the 60S Health heck-in. As the name suggested, this will trigger an 'All-in-One Scan' button located on the side of the watch, after that users will receive a detailed health report in just 60 seconds. The report will showcase six important health metrics, such as heart rate, blood oxygen levels, mental wellness, wrist temperature, sleep quality, and vascular age. However, users are warned that this feature shouldn't be used to diagnose any health issues.</p><p>Additionally, the watch will get a comprehensive “360 Mind and Body”, a feature that helps users understand health metrics that could be contributing to their increased stress levels. "Utilizing key metrics such as HRV (Heart Rate Variability), resting heart rate, and activity intensity," through this the user could actively make changes that will help balance their overall well-being.</p><p>Lastly, the company adds that since the OnePlus Watch 3 did not receive official certification from the U.S. FDA on its ECG capabilities, the ECG Analyzer feature will not be available to users in the United States or Canada. But the 60S check-in will be booted into the wearable as soon as Q2 this year.</p><p>The OnePlus Watch 3 will be available in two colorways: Obsidian Titanium (Black with a Black Band) and Emerald Titanium (Silver with a Green Band). <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oneplus.com/us/buy-oneplus-watch-3">Preorders</a> for the wearable begin today at $329.99 or $449.99 CAD, while open sales begin on Feb.25</p>

<ul><li>Spotify plans to launch a new add-on subscription tier dubbed Music Pro, priced at $6 per month in the U.S.</li><li>The tier will likely comprise higher-quality audio (HiFi), remixing tools, access to concert tickets, and the ability to mix songs from different artists.</li><li>The Music Pro tier might also include AI assistance for its users while mixing songs.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Spotify will likely bring a budget-friendly add-on tier costing $6 in the U.S. on top of the existing subscription plans, Bloomberg reports.</p><p>The new add-on subscription tier is likely to be dubbed Music Pro, notes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-15/spotify-weighs-6-premium-for-added-features-access-to-tickets">Bloomberg</a> citing sources familiar with the matter. It will also include the much-anticipated higher-quality audio, aka HiFi audio, amongst other notable features. For the unaware, we first heard about the streaming platform bringing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/spotify-hifi-launching-later-year">HiFi audio experience back in 2021</a>, and yet things seem to have not materialized.</p>
<p>The report, however, states that it will happen this year, although the precise timelines are not yet finalized. In addition to the high-quality audio, Music Pro tier users will also have access to remixing tools and concert tickets. For these, the music streaming company seems to have also held “preliminary talks” with relevant promoters and ticket sellers.</p><p>Alongside that, the report notes that Spotify is still working through things like dealing with all major music companies to get the relevant rights. The proposed Music Pro plan will also offer the ability to “mix together songs from different artists.” Additionally, these can include the help of AI too.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4654px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yV6UbV7GLa5oDRF6JrvgsK" name="spotify-wrapped-2024-pixel-9-pro-fold" alt="Andrew's Spotify Wrapped 2024 on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yV6UbV7GLa5oDRF6JrvgsK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4654" height="2618" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While it sounds like a promising tier update, users will have to shell out around $18 per month, with the addition of the Music Pro tier to the base subscription plan of $12 per month. The prices, however, are believed to vary by geography and cost accordingly, which also applies to the less-developed regions. If and when it happens, the new Music Pro tier will be a phased roll-out globally.</p><p>Overall, given the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify-hifi-still-coming">numerous delays</a> over the past few years in achieving higher-quality audio features on Spotify Premium, it is too soon to hold out hope that the aforementioned features will be released this year.</p>

<p>When you weigh the OnePlus Watch 3 vs. Watch 2, you'll find there's much more that's changed than just the extra battery life. The design has functional and stylistic changes, the performance has a subtle boost, new sensors give you a wider range of health metrics, and the display has a noticeable boost in several areas.</p><p>That said, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a> takes after the Watch 3 in predictable ways, and if you're hunting for a deal and considering the last-gen watch, this OnePlus Watch 3 vs. Watch 2 guide will help you make your decision!</p><p>Starting with everything that's <em>unchanged</em> between the two, let's dive through the key differences between these two <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">excellent Android smartwatches</a>, based on our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-hands-on">hands-on time with the OnePlus Watch 3</a> and the official specs.</p>

<h2 id="oneplus-watch-3-vs-watch-2-what-s-the-same-2">OnePlus Watch 3 vs. Watch 2: What's the same?</h2>

<p>These are the key features and design elements that are either unchanged or virtually identical between the OnePlus Watch 3 and Watch 2:</p><p><strong>Processor and memory: </strong>Both watches use the Snapdragon W5 Gen 1, a chip that launched in 2022, with 2GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. They do have different coprocessors, but we'll discuss that later. Essentially, you'll get the same performance speed as other Wear OS watches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/mobvoi-ticwatch-pro-5-enduro-review">TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro</a>.</p><p><strong>Updates: </strong>Although the OnePlus Watch 2 and 3 launched with Wear OS 4 and OS 5, respectively, both watches will receive two version updates and two years of security updates and will share the same features once the Watch 2 updates. This puts OnePlus behind Google (3 OS updates) and Samsung (4 OS updates).</p><p><strong>Straps: </strong>Both watches use 22mm fluororubber straps with stainless steel buckles; unlike other Android watches, the OnePlus Watch 3 and 2 use standard 22mm lugs, so you can use whichever compatible bands you want. We will ask OnePlus whether its fluoroelastomer material has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/does-your-fluoroelastomer-smartwatch-band-have-dangerous-compounds">any issues with toxicity</a> and update if we hear back.</p><p>OnePlus did say it implemented a "new curved strap design that enhances the wraparound fit" for more accurate sensor data, but otherwise, it should feel fairly similar; our tested found that he didn't notice a real difference in comfort.</p><p><strong>Overall size, feel, and colors: </strong>We'll discuss what's changed, design-wise, in the next section, but generally speaking, you're getting a 47mm stainless steel watch that weighs about 80g/2.8 ounces and measures about 13mm thick when you take the sensors into account. OnePlus didn't announce a smaller model for the Watch 2 or 3, which could be a deal-breaker for those with smaller wrists.</p><p>Also, the OnePlus Watch 2 and 3 come in two similar finishes. They have different names — Obsidian Titanium/ Black Steel and Emerald Titanium/ Radiant Steel — but it's essentially the same black and silver options as before.</p><p><strong>Durability:</strong> Both watches have the same dust and water resistance (IP68), though not at the same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">IP69</a> rating as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>. OnePlus lists a wide range of military-grade durability tests that the Watch 3 (and 2) passed, including high/low temperature, solar radiation, 96-hour salt spray, vibration, impact, acidic atmosphere, and freezing rain. It's not bulletproof but as rugged as you'd hope for in an Android watch.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="V2SQmxfHiJaFRuKtNJ5ZQZ" name="oneplus-watch-3-vs-oneplus-watch-2-watch-faces" alt="The OnePlus Watch 3 (left) and OnePlus Watch 2 (right) showing two similar watch faces focused on different metrics." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V2SQmxfHiJaFRuKtNJ5ZQZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Despite being the same general size, the OnePlus Watch 3 has a new titanium bezel instead of stainless steel, adding a metallic sheen around the edge where the OnePlus Watch 2 had a "sizeable bezel" enveloping the display that annoyed our reviewer.</p><p>Removing that wasted space, OnePlus gave the Watch 3 a 1.5-inch display, a slight visual boost over the 1.43-inch Watch 2. That matches larger Android watches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a>. We're a little surprised that OnePlus didn't increase the resolution to match the size increase; both watches have 466 x 466 resolution, so the Watch 2's pixels per inch ratio is slightly more dense (~15ppi).</p><p>Still, the OnePlus Watch 3 display has more significant upgrades that make it the clear winner: It hits a peak brightness of 2,200 nits instead of 600 nits and uses an LTPO AMOLED material capable of dipping as low as 1Hz to save battery life.</p><p>Interestingly, our OnePlus Watch 3 tester found there wasn't much visual difference between the two in direct sunlight. He instead appreciated that the Watch 3 uses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-enable-dc-dimming-on-the-oneplus-12-and-oneplus-12r">DC dimming</a> at all brightness levels instead of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM</a>, which can cause headaches for susceptible people.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FYXH6JEAXknmUhbbjvRGHZ" name="oneplus-watch-3-vs-oneplus-watch-2-crown" alt="A close-up of the OnePlus Watch 2 (left) and OnePlus Watch 3 (right) crowns." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FYXH6JEAXknmUhbbjvRGHZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Overall, the OnePlus Watch 3 design looks more like a sports watch thanks to its 60-second scale around the titanium bezel, similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2r-review">OnePlus Watch 2R</a>. The latter did well in our recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-held-a-smartwatch-beauty-pageant-with-surprising-results">smartwatch beauty pageant</a>, and I think it's no surprise that OnePlus realized that this style would make its mainline watches look more distinct.</p><p>OnePlus annoyed some Watch 2 owners by adding a decorative crown with no actual navigational abilities. Hearing that criticism, it converted the OnePlus Watch 3 crown to be functional: you can rotate through menus and press it to select options, so you're no longer fully touch-dependent.</p><p>The crown has a "tapered, pyramid-pattern" texture that's easy to twist. Our tester praised it as the "best crown I've used on any watch to date," noting that it's large enough for your finger to rest comfortably on it, it has a nice tactility, and the haptics feel great when twisted.</p>
<h2 id="oneplus-watch-3-vs-watch-2-performance-battery-life-and-charging-2">OnePlus Watch 3 vs. Watch 2: Performance, battery life, and charging</h2>
<p>Even though these watches share a main processor and RAM, the Watch 3 switches to a new coprocessor called the BES2800 for background RTOS tasks. Built on 6nm FinFET tech, it's supposed to have a 200% CPU boost and 400% NPU boost over the 12nm BES2700 in the Watch 2.</p><p>When reviewing last year's Watch 2, our reviewer complained that things didn't work reliably because of the dual-OS solution; we have reason to hope that this upgrade on the Watch 3 will solve some of his problems, like health-tracking inaccuracies and dropped notifications.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="JhQDhrgVU9BkqXfpExCMxh" name="OnePlus-Watch-3-official-workout-photo" alt="An athletic man stands with the sun behind him, holding his OnePlus Watch 3 while cueing up an "Outdoor fat burn run" with the screen showing a map." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JhQDhrgVU9BkqXfpExCMxh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In terms of battery life, there's an obvious 131mAh capacity increase, but OnePlus pulled this off while making the Watch 3 slightly skinnier because of the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/most-android-flagships-are-getting-an-exciting-battery-upgrade-in-2025">silicone-carbon battery tech</a>, which OnePlus calls Silicon NanoStack Battery. It makes your battery denser, meaning you get more capacity and better durability against extreme temperatures while using less space.</p><p>So far, we've found the OnePlus Watch 3 can easily last an estimated five days, including with daily workouts, but our initial hands-on test didn't include sleep tracking. Your personal battery mileage may vary, but generally speaking, <em>both</em> watches are much longer-lived than the average smartwatch; the Watch 3 simply gives you a bit more leeway if you're a power user who frequently makes on-wrist calls, streams music to Bluetooth earbuds, or does a lot of GPS workouts.</p><p>Equally important, both watches support VOOC fast charging that gives you about a day of battery life in 10 minutes. Interestingly, our OnePlus Watch 3 tester found he could charge it from 20% to 100% in just 30 minutes, while the Watch 2 took about an hour to charge fully. OnePlus didn't announce a charging speed increase, but it <em>appears</em> that the Watch 3 charges faster despite its larger capacity.</p>
<h2 id="oneplus-watch-3-vs-watch-2-sensors-and-connectivity-2">OnePlus Watch 3 vs. Watch 2: Sensors and connectivity</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="gPjN5NmcaGd9zsuvadw7FZ" name="oneplus-watch-3-vs-oneplus-watch-2-health-sensors-underside" alt="The OnePlus Watch 3 (left) and OnePlus Watch 2 (right) sitting upside down without bands, showing the health sensors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gPjN5NmcaGd9zsuvadw7FZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While both OnePlus Watches have 8-channel optical heart rate sensors and 16-channel blood oxygen (SpO2) sensors, OnePlus is promising much more accurate results on the Watch 3. We found the Watch 2 wasn't especially accurate for workouts, making this a much-needed improvement.</p><p>Reportedly, the OnePlus Watch 3 has a new back cover glass that improves LED efficiency and a redesigned sensor layout "to reduce the distance between the LED and photodetector" to ensure "signal quality." OnePlus also says it improved its heart rate algorithm.</p><p>This is all on paper, but in our early testing, the OnePlus Watch 3 delivered workout results much closer to that of other smartwatches, whereas the Watch 2 often had curiously deflated results.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="mfzazA9HYnxvDGRkTs7aHZ" name="oneplus-watch-3-vs-oneplus-watch-2-health-heart-rate" alt="The OnePlus Watch 3 (left) and OnePlus Watch 2 (right) showing comparative heart rate data for the same workout." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mfzazA9HYnxvDGRkTs7aHZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Aside from improved accuracy, the OnePlus Watch 3 added an "ECG Analyzer" to judge your heart health; unfortunately, it won't be available in the United States or Canada because OnePlus chose not to try and get FDA certification as a "business decision" to save money.</p><p>OnePlus is adding a 60-second health check-in to the Watch 3 starting in March 2025 that'll analyze your vascular age, heart rate, SpO2, mental wellness, sleep quality, wrist temperature, and (in Europe and Asia) ECG data. Your vascular health, or arterial stiffness risk, will be a new major focus with its own app and tile, aiming to catch hypertension issues.</p><p>In addition, OnePlus is offering new sleep data insights in the OHealth app — though we suspect some of them will come to the Watch 2, as well. Essentially, you'll be able to check your sleep score/duration, respiratory rate, HRV, body movement, snoring levels, and your resting heart rate compared to your typical baseline.</p><p>But the big new addition is skin temperature. You must wear the watch for at least four hours of sleep tracking per night for five days; after that, OnePlus will have a temperature baseline to compare against, warning you if your health check or overnight temperature appears elevated.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="DFAqZxj8nxLgWwNayHdYBi" name="OnePlus-Watch-3-official-sleep-tracking-photo" alt="A sleeping woman laying in bed in a dark room wearing a OnePlus Watch 3." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DFAqZxj8nxLgWwNayHdYBi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On the connectivity front, OnePlus upgraded the Bluetooth chip from 5.0 to 5.2 for the Watch 3, but the Wi-Fi standard is unchanged. You get NFC for Google Wallet payments, but it appears that OnePlus once again won't offer an LTE upgrade option or ultra-wideband support.</p><p>One subtle upgrade is to GPS tracking. The OnePlus Watch 2 had dual-band GPS, but the OnePlus Watch 3 has a new "circular-polarized antenna" that's designed to capture weak signals more reliably and "reduce refraction caused by tall buildings." Plus, it added a new 7nm GPS chip that reportedly reduces power consumption by "over 50%" while speeding up your satellite search.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xepaVEm9ETy59vWZ5zpyFZ" name="oneplus-watch-3-vs-oneplus-watch-2-watch-faces-02" alt="The OnePlus Watch 2 (left) and OnePlus Watch 3 (right) held in two hands, showing their default watch faces." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xepaVEm9ETy59vWZ5zpyFZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OnePlus kept the same rugged, classic design philosophy for the Watch 3 and 2, and Qualcomm's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/qualcomms-next-wear-os-chipset-could-arrive-in-2025">next Snapdragon chip</a> likely won't be available until later this year, so OnePlus had no upgrade option. But otherwise, this guide should clarify just how many generational changes OnePlus made with the Watch 3! Almost nothing was left unchanged.</p><p>If you bought the OnePlus Watch 2, I can't tell you whether it's too soon to upgrade or not, but OnePlus certainly made the Watch 3 tempting.</p><p>The upgrades to the background MCU and health sensors, along with subtle OHealth changes, make it more reliable as a fitness watch. The battery life and charging boosts are significant, but the Watch 2 is no slouch in either area. You'll really appreciate the brighter, smoother display, but you may not appreciate the lack of a 1.2- or 1.3-inch option.</p><p>Until our OnePlus Watch 3 review lets us test the battery, software, and health data more thoroughly, we can't give a full-throated recommendation. But based on our initial impressions, this is a much stronger Android smartwatch than the Watch 2, and I'd recommend paying extra for the Watch 3 instead of grabbing the Watch 2 on sale.</p>

Although to be fair, this is true for most phones as companies stuff more features into them each year. On Samsung devices, in particular, there are a lot of hidden features, duplicate apps/services, and various settings that you may not be aware of.</p><p>So, while we have plenty of tips and tricks for individual <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phones</a>, these are the settings that can be applied on most Samsung phones and aren't device-specific (with some exceptions for flagship features). These are also suggestions on features you can change and apps to download, but obviously, it's up to you whether or not to follow some or all of these tips.</p><p>So, now that you've moved over all your data to a new Samsung device, here are some things you should do to get the most out of your phone.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-change-power-button-to-power-menu"><span>Change power button to power menu</span></h2>
<p>For some reason, companies have gotten into the habit of defaulting the power button to enable digital assistants like Bixby or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a>/<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a>. When set up this way, powering your phone off will require you to press both the power and volume up button, just adding an extra layer to what should be a simple function.</p><p>While quick access to your digital assistant is nice and all, there are other ways to evoke the assistants, and if you're like us, you want the power button to act like a power button.</p><p>Fortunately, changing this is pretty easy, even if it's still annoying that you have to. In order to get your power button back, navigate to <strong>Settings > Advanced features > Side button</strong>. In the <strong>Long Press</strong> section, make sure it's set to <strong>Power off menu</strong>, unless you really want to use it to wake Bixby or Gemini.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4520px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:67.52%;"><img id="9KcoSGFJsYTtshZM6yjedH" name="Samsung-one-ui-side-button" alt="Side button options on a Samsung phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9KcoSGFJsYTtshZM6yjedH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4520" height="3052" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You can also use this menu to enable the Double press option for the power button, which can either open the camera or open an app of your choosing.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-choose-between-bixby-or-google-assistant-gemini"><span>Choose between Bixby or Google (Assistant/Gemini)</span></h2>
<p>It's always important to check and change your default apps and services to fit your needs. The AI assistant is among those, and while the newer Samsung phones come with Gemini as the default, older models often default to Bixby, which isn't everyone's cup of tea. Regardless of what your preference is, changing the default is pretty simple.</p><p>Navigate to <strong>Settings > Apps > Default apps</strong>, then tap <strong>Digital assistant app</strong>. This will set the AI assistant that will wake up whenever you use the Side button (if you have that enabled). There are also other digital assistant options you can enable here, such as the ability to analyze on-screen text and on-screen images and the option to flash the screen.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4520px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:67.52%;"><img id="mu5nLuEiuLj9Xi6sjWzBmH" name="Samsung-one-ui-default-digital-assistant" alt="Default digital assistant on a Samsung phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mu5nLuEiuLj9Xi6sjWzBmH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4520" height="3052" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-set-up-gesture-nagivation"><span>Set up gesture nagivation</span></h2>
<p>Since around 2017, gesture navigation has become a bit of a norm for phones, replacing the three-button navigation for an arguably more intuitive way to navigate your phone. That said, there are many phones that will still default to the three-button navigation of the olden days, but changing that is pretty easy.</p><p>You can set this during the setup process, but in case you decide you want to switch the navigation type, you can navigate to <strong>Settings > Display > Navigation bar</strong>, and select the option for <strong>Swipe gestures</strong>. You can also select <strong>More options</strong> to adjust the Gesture sensitivity, which will help improve gestures when you have a case on your phone.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4520px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:67.52%;"><img id="mjPDYUWbJkHrvj3zzySvmH" name="Samsung-one-ui-Gesture-navigation" alt="Gesture navigation options on a Samsung phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mjPDYUWbJkHrvj3zzySvmH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4520" height="3052" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-update-galaxy-apps"><span>Update Galaxy apps</span></h2>
<p>You should always be sure to update your apps in the Play Store to ensure you're using the most up-to-date versions. However, not all of your apps come from the Play Store. Samsung phones also manage some apps with the company's own app store, aka the Galaxy Store.</p><p>It's important to update these apps as they'll provide improved functionality to built-in Samsung apps and features.</p><p>Head to the Galaxy Store, tap the <strong>Menu</strong> tab, then tap <strong>Updates</strong>. If there are updates present, they'll be listed here.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4520px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:67.52%;"><img id="WUvEos5cjLaqLM8ue3W5QJ" name="Samsung-one-ui-Galaxy-Store-app-updates" alt="Updating Galaxy Store apps on a Samsung phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WUvEos5cjLaqLM8ue3W5QJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4520" height="3052" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-download-good-lock"><span>Download Good Lock</span></h2>
<p>Android is often praised for its ability to be customized by users, but different OEMs offer various levels of customization options out of the box. Samsung gives users plenty of options, but what you might not know is that Samsung has a way to offer even deeper levels of customization.</p><p>Enter <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-good-lock">Good Lock</a>. It's an app that offers various modules a user can download to change different aspects of the UI, from the notification bar to the Settings Menu layout and much more. You can get pretty creative with Good Lock, which makes it a staple on any Samsung phone.</p><p>You can download Good Lock from the Galaxy Store or Play Store, after which you will have to download individual modules. From there, you can play around with different settings so your phone looks and behaves exactly how you want it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jR2Gcb2Wo8XSNoioVVm5pD" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-Good-Lock.jpg" alt="Good Lock on the Galaxy Z Flip 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jR2Gcb2Wo8XSNoioVVm5pD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-switch-to-a-vertical-scrolling-app-drawer"><span>Switch to a vertical scrolling app drawer</span></h2>
<p>For years, Samsung phones defaulted to a horizontal paginated app drawer, which many people don't like. Fortunately, the company lets you switch to a vertical app drawer similar to what's found on just about every other Android phone.</p><p>With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a>, it's pretty easy to enable. You'll just head to your app drawer and tap the <strong>three dots </strong>in the Search bar. Tap <strong>Sort</strong> and then choose <strong>Alphabetical order</strong>. Now, the app drawer will switch to vertical scrolling with a bar on the side to easily jump to a certain letter.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4520px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:67.52%;"><img id="fqdp9QiS3sP3nkfHDXfLjJ" name="Samsung-one-ui-7-vertical-app-drawer" alt="Enable vertical app drawer on a Samsung phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fqdp9QiS3sP3nkfHDXfLjJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4520" height="3052" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-download-camera-assistant"><span>Download Camera Assistant</span></h2>
<p>Like Good Lock, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-customize-samsung-galaxy-camera-settings-good-lock">Camera Assistant app</a> is another app we wish Samsung included by default on its phones. Camera Assistant adds more settings to your stock camera app, which can change the UI, adjust how fast the phone captures images, or even change how the app processes images. It's pretty handy if you want to improve your camera experience.</p><p>Download the Camera Assistant app from the Galaxy Store. Then, open the <strong>Camera app</strong> and navigate to the <strong>Camera Settings</strong>. Scroll to <strong>Camera Assistant</strong>, and from there, go through the list of options and adjust the camera with the settings you think will work best for your needs. For instance, having quick access to a 2x button is quite helpful for many, while the option to fix image distortion can enhance photos taken with the ultrawide camera.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4520px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:70.00%;"><img id="iERzcEkTuLrDSAVVPHajiH" name="Samsung-Camera-Assistant-app" alt="Camera Assistant app on a Samsung phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iERzcEkTuLrDSAVVPHajiH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4520" height="3164" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-set-up-modes-and-routines"><span>Set up Modes and Routines</span></h2>
<p>Smartphones are pretty smart, but sometimes they need a little help to know what you want. That's where modes and routines come in. With this feature on your Samsung phone, you can set up various modes to help minimize distractions from your phone based on your activity, whether its sleeping, working out, or if you're at the movie theater. You can also set up easy automations for your phone to perform based on a location or activity.</p><p>To set this up, navigate to <strong>Settings > Modes and Routines</strong>. Here, you'll find two tabs where you can set up new or create modes and routines. There are already preset modes that you can edit, which should cover many of the basics, but you're also free to add a new one. Routines will have to be set up from scratch, but they're pretty easy to put together; it's just a simple if/then formula with options already available to you.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3030px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.73%;"><img id="j7MxFyM2o3npCCgrHYVsVH" name="Samsung-one-ui-Modes" alt="Modes and routines on a Samsung phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/j7MxFyM2o3npCCgrHYVsVH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3030" height="3052" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Routines come especially handy if you have smart home devices like smart light bulbs and want them to automatically turn on when you arrive at your home. You can set up useful routines such as this or even ones that will adjust settings on your phone based on certain actions or times of the day.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-enable-galaxy-ai-features"><span>Enable Galaxy AI features</span></h2>
<p>AI is everywhere, and while Google has a ton of fun features you can access via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos</a>, Samsung also has its suite of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> features to take advantage of for osme of its higher-end smartphones. Fortunately, you can find all these new features in one place and enable or disable them easily.</p><p>Navigate to <strong>Settings > Galaxy AI</strong>, and you'll see a list of features available on your device. As of One UI 7, these are the features you'll find on your eligible Samsung phone:</p>
<ul><li>Call assist</li><li>Writing assist</li><li>Interpreter</li><li>Note assist</li><li>Transcript assist</li><li>Browsing assist</li><li>Photo assist</li><li>Drawing assist</li><li>Audio eraser (Galaxy S25)</li><li>Photo ambient wallpaper</li><li>Now brief</li><li>Health assist</li></ul>
<p>Dive into each of these options to toggle or change settings, such as voices, summarizations, and even languages. You can also download languages directly from some of these options so that your phone can translate on-device. Furthermore, you can opt to process AI features on-device for additional privacy.</p><p>Some features, such as Photo assist, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-ai-drawing-assist-samsung-galaxy-s25">Drawing assist</a>, Photo ambient wallpaper, and Health assist, will be found in apps such as the Gallery app, Notes, the Edge panel, and Wallpaper and style.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4520px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:67.52%;"><img id="dHxquB8h7uvAdmHDJnpUzH" name="Samsung-Galaxy-AI" alt="Galaxy AI options on a Samsung phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dHxquB8h7uvAdmHDJnpUzH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4520" height="3052" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, not every Samsung device has access to Galaxy AI. The features are mostly exclusive to flagship phones and will vary depending on the device based on its hardware capabilities, including the Galaxy S series (S22 to S25), Z series (Flip/Fold 4 to Flip/Fold 6), the Tab S8 to S10 series, and older models (S21 series, Z Flip/Fold 3).</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-use-the-edge-panel-for-quick-access-to-apps"><span>Use the Edge panel for quick access to apps </span></h2>
<p>One of our favorite Samsung features is the Edge panel. This hides away a selection of apps and other tools that you can easily access with a swipe from either side of the display. It sort of acts similar to a taskbar you'll find on foldable phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, but it's a bit more functional as it doesn't just access applications.</p><p>To turn it on, navigate to <strong>Settings > Display > Edge panels</strong>, and toggle the feature on. Tapping on the option will take you to a separate menu for Edge panels, where you can select which panels you want active and customize the handle.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4520px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:67.52%;"><img id="At7Rx58U3g3FcBnPJhtcjH" name="Samsung-one-ui-Edge-panels" alt="Edge panels on a Samsung phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/At7Rx58U3g3FcBnPJhtcjH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4520" height="3052" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Available panels include:</p>
<ul><li>Apps</li><li>People</li><li>Tasks</li><li>Weather</li><li>Tools</li><li>Music</li><li>Reminder</li><li>Clipboard</li></ul>
<p>Keep in mind that you have a limit of 22 apps you can add to the Apps panel, so your best bet is to choose the ones you'll likely want to access most.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-enable-google-wallet-and-disable-samsung-wallet"><span>Enable Google Wallet and disable Samsung Wallet</span></h2>
<p>It seems like Samsung and Google are often fighting for your attention on these devices, as you can often find duplicate apps from both companies that do essentially the same thing. That's where Samsung Wallet and Google Wallet come in. Samsung Wallet is fine but has fallen from grace over the years following major changes and the deprecation of features.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet">Google Wallet</a> has seemingly thrived since its rebirth, with more and more banks supporting it and Google making it easy to add things like transit tickets, passes, and now even digital IDs. There's little reason not to use Google Wallet, as it's slowly becoming an all-in-one digital wallet.</p><p>To enable it, make sure you download Google Wallet if it's not already installed on your phone. You'll then want to navigate to <strong>Settings > Apps > Choose default apps</strong> to set Google Wallet as the default.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4520px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:67.52%;"><img id="CAYDpyR4ttRfcsZa7chXkH" name="Samsung-one-ui-default-wallet-app" alt="Default wallet app on a Samsung phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CAYDpyR4ttRfcsZa7chXkH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4520" height="3052" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You'll also want to disable Quick access so you don't keep pulling up Samsung Wallet whenever you swipe up from the bottom of the display. To do this, enter the <strong>Quick access tab</strong> in Samsung Wallet, tap <strong>Settings</strong>, and tap <strong>Quick Access</strong>. The first option you'll see is <strong>Swipe up gesture</strong>, which will allow you to toggle off the Lock screen, Home screen, and Screen off.</p><p>Alternatively, you can always uninstall the Samsung Wallet app if you decide you just don't want to deal with it at all.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-switch-out-samsung-keyboard-for-gboard"><span>Switch out Samsung Keyboard for Gboard</span></h2>
<p>We know Samsung Keyboard's uses, and they are few. The default keyboard experience on a Samsung phone isn't that great, although there are some useful features, such as the Interpreter mode, which translates text conversations for you. But I digress.</p><p>You're better off switching to Gboard, as it's much better at... well, everything. Plus, you get access to Emoji Kitchen, which lets you create fun emoji mashups. And on One UI 7, Samsung even made it so you can still use some Galaxy AI features without having Samsung Keyboard enabled, which is a huge win.</p><p>First, you'll want to download Gboard, which you can do from the Play Store. Then, navigate to <strong>Settings > General management > Keyboard list and default</strong>. Toggle Gboard on, then tap the option to personalize the keyboard's theme and behaviors. Then, in the keyboard menu, tap <strong>Default keyboard</strong> and select <strong>Gboard</strong>.</p><p>You're welcome.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-set-preferred-autofill-service-for-passwords"><span>Set preferred autofill service for passwords</span></h2>
<p>It's always annoying to have to remember all your passwords and login information. That's where autofill comes in, which attempts to save that information across devices when you sign into the same account where the information is saved. There are various password options that you can use to save your passwords, but you'll want to make sure you enable the right one when you set up your Samsung device to make it easier to log into all your apps.</p><p>Navigate to <strong>Settings > Security and privacy > More security settings > Passwords, passkeys, and autofill</strong>.

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-enable-notification-categories"><span>Enable Notification categories</span></h2>
<p>One UI has come a long way, and we were impressed with One UI 6 and more so with One UI 7. However, Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/enable-notification-categories-samsung-galaxy-s24">changed how notifications are handled</a>, which some may find annoying and/or limiting. Notification categories gives you more granular control over notifications, which is quite useful, but it's disabled by default on Samsung's more recent software versions. Here's how you can turn it back on.</p><p>Navigate to <strong>Settings > Notifications > Advanced settings</strong>. Scroll down and enable the option to <strong>Manage notification categories</strong> for each app. Now, you can choose how specific apps notify you during certain events instead of a one-size-fits-all situation.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-make-sure-you-re-backing-up-your-data"><span>Make sure you're backing up your data</span></h2>
<p>This should come as a no-brainer, but you'd be surprised how many people still don't back up their phones. It's important because it lets you keep all your data when moving from one device to another in case you lose or break one device. That way, even if the old device isn't accessible, your data will still be safe.</p><p>Get started with backing up your data by navigating to <strong>Settings > Accounts and backup</strong> and then choosing between Samsung Cloud and Google Drive.</p><p>With Samsung Cloud, tap <strong>Back up data</strong> and toggle on the data you want to be backed up to your Samsung account. With Google Drive, the phone will utilize <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One</a> to back up and manage your data. It's a bit less granular than Samsung Cloud, but you should still back up to Google One even if you backed up to Samsung Cloud; that way, you have your data in more than one place.</p>

<p>Now that you've followed these steps, you should have a better idea of the ways you can customize your Samsung phone just the way you like. Of course, all of these are optional, so you can always change things up depending on your preferences, but now you at least know where to find settings for some of One UI's most useful features.</p>
