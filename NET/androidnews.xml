It covers phones, tablets, and everything in between.</p></div></div><p>As you step out into the blazing sun this summer, it's almost guaranteed that you'll have to squint to see your phone's display. While smartphone displays have gotten stupidly bright in the last few years, many are still difficult to see in direct sunlight.</p><p>That's where the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> comes in. While some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> have brighter displays, the Galaxy S25 Ultra turns the tables by implementing a brilliant anti-glare layer that makes it dead easy to see in the sunlight, and that's great for anyone who spends a lot of time outdoors, especially this time of year.</p><p>But not all is rosy with Samsung's latest flagship display. While the display excels in several areas, lingering problems from the Galaxy S24 Ultra haven't been properly addressed. Let's take a deeper dive into what makes the Galaxy S25 Ultra so good to use outside and why it's a little tougher to enjoy indoors.</p><p>And with Prime Day right around the corner, be sure to check out some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-deals-of-the-month">Galaxy S25 Ultra deals</a> ↓, as some pretty hot ones are already live.</p><h2 id="comfort-is-key-2">Comfort is key</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="PMGmZoK3rZwMt7WQ59uTKB" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-ui-lockscreen-widgets-neon" alt="A Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra with a widget-covered lockscreen on a rainy neon-soaked street" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PMGmZoK3rZwMt7WQ59uTKB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In the modern era, all flagship phone displays look good. This applies to most phone specs these days, from performance to camera quality, which means differentiating products usually comes down to one or two categories that a product is strongest in.</p><p>Most display reviews and analysis <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-displays-arent-the-gold-standard-you-think-they-are">focus too much on lab tests</a> and not enough on the human part of the equation. Most people don't care about the difference between 97% and 99% color accuracy, and it's unlikely most people will ever notice that difference anyway, even if you hold two phones next to each other. Instead, I want to focus on the human quotient for these display reviews.</p><p>In the case of the Galaxy S25 Ultra, its display is weakest in the comfort category, but it has some standout attributes that are noteworthy. Let's start with the positive!</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-reflectivity"><span>Reflectivity</span></h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:67.58%;"><img id="YvPeSi8LiMTv4uvRQM6hKe" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-vs-oneplus-13-reflectivity-above" alt="Testing screen reflectivity in full sunlight between the OnePlus 13 and Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YvPeSi8LiMTv4uvRQM6hKe.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:67.58%;"><img id="5BsK2xaJaV2ynqyyzaGfGe" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-vs-oneplus-13-reflectivity-side" alt="Testing screen reflectivity in full sunlight between the OnePlus 13 and Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5BsK2xaJaV2ynqyyzaGfGe.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Samsung's anti-glare filter, first introduced on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, is one of the best things Samsung has ever done for screen visibility. In the above images, I compare it to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>, our current favorite Android phone, and one with higher peak brightness capabilities than the Galaxy S25 Ultra.</p><p>Despite being a brighter display, the OnePlus 13 is harder to see outdoors because of the reflectivity of the glass. The Galaxy S25 Ultra is incredibly clean and vibrant, while it's just plain difficult to see the OnePlus 13. Now, to be clear, I'm not picking on OnePlus here. Nearly every other phone on the market is just as hard to see, and it's because almost no other company uses the type of anti-glare glass the S25 Ultra has.</p><p>The only problem here is that most screen protectors for the phone don't have an anti-glare layer applied, meaning <em>everything</em> that makes the display so visible outdoors gets ruined. Make sure you get one like this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Anti-Reflecting-Fingerprint-Anti-Scratch-EF-US938CTEGUS/dp/B0DKZ7F64Y/">official Samsung anti-reflection film</a> to keep the display's best attribute from being ruined!</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-eye-comfort-settings"><span>Eye comfort settings</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PmNk3tqBQiWRdMRBrPP3eY" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-eye-comfort-mode-blue-light-filter" alt="Comparing the blue subpixel brightness on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra with eye comfort mode enabled and disabled" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PmNk3tqBQiWRdMRBrPP3eY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung's blue light filter, which the company calls "Eye Comfort Shield," helps block blue light by reducing the intensity of blue subpixels. This makes the display appear much yellower and does a good job of reducing blue light emissions.</p><p>You can see this in action in the image above, which I captured with a microscope using a pure white image on the screen. Note how the intensity of the blue subpixels is notably reduced when Eye Comfort Shield is enabled.</p><p>By default, the mode will automatically adjust blue light based on the time of day. During daylight hours, blue light will be close to the default setting as if the mode were disabled. At night, the blue light will be automatically reduced to help better match the circadian rhythm of the human body, since most natural blue light only occurs during the day from sunlight.</p><p>Unfortunately, Samsung's only real eye care solution is blue light blocking, a problem that you'll learn more about in the brightness section below.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-color-accuracy-and-depth"><span>Color accuracy and depth</span></h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4864px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ujgdvC9EXHDbA5GgwxeptU" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-vs-galaxy-s24-ultra-colors-natural" alt="Comparing the color calibration and adjustment settings between the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra and Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ujgdvC9EXHDbA5GgwxeptU.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4864" height="2736" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4864px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bfnyLUBUPP5XfnExmUHUvU" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-vs-galaxy-s24-ultra-colors-vivid" alt="Comparing the color calibration and adjustment settings between the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra and Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bfnyLUBUPP5XfnExmUHUvU.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4864" height="2736" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4864px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oFsSFgABsyLZWotyhZTcvU" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-vs-galaxy-s24-ultra-colors-manual" alt="Comparing the color calibration and adjustment settings between the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra and Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oFsSFgABsyLZWotyhZTcvU.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4864" height="2736" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>When the Galaxy S24 Ultra first launched, the display was considered "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-washed-out-display-is-intentional">washed out</a>" by some long-time Samsung fans. Samsung answered by adding in a vividness slider and enhancing the colors of the display.

The main problem is that Samsung continues to use 8-bit panels in their phones despite the entire industry switching to 10-bit as the standard.</p><p>For the test, I used an 8-bit and 10-bit gradient comparison image <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/jursonovicst/gradient">found on GitHub</a>. On the Galaxy S25 Ultra's panel, there's little to no difference between the 8-bit and 10-bit gradients. The OnePlus 13 shows additional colors throughout all the gradients, although the green gradient showed up best on camera.</p><p>Many users have complained about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1800809349214028132">color banding on wallpaper</a> and other images, even ones taken with the Galaxy S25 Ultra's camera, since that camera can capture 10-bit images. And while Samsung absolutely needs to upgrade their displays to 10-bit to keep up with the pack, I want to commend them for not stooping to using color dithering to fake 10-bit color. Some other companies, like Xiaomi, use color dithering to fake deeper colors and it's painful for some users because of the flickering pixels.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-brightness-and-dimming"><span>Brightness and dimming</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:30.17%;"><img id="UNtpQJQV6hpfX8ckEVY7Fe" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-brightness-comparison" alt="Comparing brightness levels of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra's display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UNtpQJQV6hpfX8ckEVY7Fe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="5184" height="1564" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Everything this phone tells you about its brightness levels is a lie. Setting the brightness slider at 100% never actually means 100% brightness under any circumstance.</p><p>Normal "100%" brightness, like most phones, doesn't come close to the advertised peak brightness. That's normally reserved for the dedicated "sunlight mode" that gets activated when a bright light, like the sun, shines on the screen's light sensor. We can force this by holding a flashlight up to the display and measuring the nit output. Even in sunlight mode, the display tops out at around 2,000 nits.</p><p>At normal 100% brightness, this number sits at around 800 nits, which is surprisingly low for a modern phone. Extra brightness mode brings this number up to around 1,500 nits, which is closer to an expected value from "100% brightness," but that's not the biggest problem with this display's brightness capabilities.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Jb49z63HfNdBz2Ag7Qecs6" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-dimming-comparison" alt="Comparing the dimming methods of a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra at all brightness levels, including PWM frequency graphs" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Jb49z63HfNdBz2Ag7Qecs6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="5184" height="2916" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Instead, that comes down to Samsung using Pulse Width Modulation (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a>) to control brightness. This means there is no point in time where the Galaxy S25 Ultra's display hits its maximum brightness potential, the way the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/this-hidden-galaxy-s24-fe-feature-needs-to-be-on-all-samsung-phones">Galaxy S24 FE's display</a> does, for example.</p><p>Worse yet, Samsung is still using a very low frequency 480Hz PWM rate for the Galaxy S25 Ultra's display. Phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Honor Magic 7 Pro</a> use 4320Hz PWM dimming and, even then, Honor's phones only use this at low brightness to keep colors accurate and pixels evenly lit.</p><p>Despite all this, the Galaxy S25 Ultra's display still suffers from mura, an effect that means pixels are not evenly lit across the entire panel.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LidpCr2rwfqY3YToGVKpwS" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-vs-oneplus-13-mura" alt="Comparing the mura on the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra's display with the OnePlus 13's display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LidpCr2rwfqY3YToGVKpwS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>At 20% brightness, a grain pattern is clearly visible on the Galaxy S25 Ultra's display. While you can see it at varying ranges of brightness, it's most visible at low brightness levels <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-grainy-mura-problem-reported">and was a problem</a> even back when the Galaxy S24 Ultra launched.

The OnePlus 13's pixels look evenly lit across the board, while the Galaxy S25 Ultra's have a clear "dirty" or grainy pattern.</p><p>Some people are more sensitive to this than others, and the effect tends to be worse on some colors than others.

The display on the Galaxy S25 Ultra shines particularly bright outside, where the anti-glare filter makes it more easily visible than any other phone I've ever used. It's a brilliant spot of engineering that I wish more phones would copy!</p><p>But while blue light control and color accuracy are good, Samsung's continued use of 8-bit panels means color banding is more common on the Galaxy S25 Ultra than on any other competing phone in this price range. Luminance consistency and brightness management are also mediocre, with noticeable grain at low brightness and low-HZ PWM dimming at all brightness levels.</p><p>While the display looks good on the surface and does a great job of highlighting the strengths of AMOLED — vibrant colors, deep blacks, and no ghosting — the quality of the panel Samsung is using leaves a lot to be desired for a $1,300 phone. Even budget Android phones offer better dimming methods and faster PWM rates, native 10-bit depth, and no mura.</p><p>Does this mean the Galaxy S25 Ultra's display is bad? No, not at all, but there's plenty of room for improvement on the Galaxy S26 Ultra.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Whether it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmins-post-tariff-strategy-could-include-pricier-watches-and-cutbacks">post-tariff strategy</a>, inflation, or just Garmin knowing people love its devices, Garmin charges more than most fitness watch brands. Having reviewed dozens of Garmin watches, I can point new and returning Garmin users to the models they should try first. Otherwise, you'll spend too much without being prepared for the downsides.</p><p>In my mind, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watches</a> fall into three tiers: Baseline, mid-range, and expensive. Garmin tends to sell different types of watches in each category:</p><div ><table><caption>Garmin tiers</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Audience</p></th><th  ><p>Baseline ($200–349)</p></th><th  ><p>Mid-range ($350–550)</p></th><th  ><p>Expensive ($600+)</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Running</p></td><td  ><p>Forerunner 55 / 165 / 255</p></td><td  ><p>Forerunner 265 / 570</p></td><td  ><p>Forerunner 965 / 970</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Adventurers / hikers</p></td><td  ><p>Instinct E / 2</p></td><td  ><p>Instinct 3 (Solar)</p></td><td  ><p>Enduro 3, Fenix 8, Tactix 8</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Gym / all-around</p></td><td  ><p>Vivoactive 5 / 6, Lily 2 Active, Vivomove Trend</p></td><td  ><p>Venu 3</p></td><td  ><p>Venu X1, MARQ Gen 2</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Golf</p></td><td  ><p>Approach S12 / S44</p></td><td  ><p>Approach S50</p></td><td  ><p>Approach S70</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The baseline models are tempting because they offer a reasonable price for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness" target="_blank">fitness watches</a>, but they also tend to have older hardware, such as last-generation health and GPS data, or MIP displays, along with blocked software that upsells you to mid-tier models. They also have the "worst" battery life, but still tend to hit between 1–2 weeks, crushing the competition.</p><p>I tend to recommend mid-tier Garmin watches, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review" target="_blank">Venu 3</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-3-review" target="_blank">Instinct 3,</a> first because they offer an upgraded experience while costing <em>only slightly</em> more than an Apple Watch. The problem is that these, too, have downgrades and cut features to make the expensive tier more attractive, like the outdoor-focused Instinct 3 not offering maps.</p><p>As amazing as watches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Fenix 8</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-ditched-my-apple-and-galaxy-watches-for-a-garmin-and-you-should-too">Enduro 3</a> are, I just can't recommend a thousand-dollar watch to anyone who isn't already familiar with Garmin's UI quirks and labyrinthine Connect app. Instead, let's get you started with Garmin watches that will let you dip your toes into the ecosystem and see whether you like it.</p><h2 id="which-garmin-watches-justify-their-price-to-beginners-2">Which Garmin watches justify their price to beginners</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4109px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="2nX3bKtM98uLsNbfyJyjBC" name="Garmin-Vivoactive-6-review-12" alt="A workout animation on the Garmin Vivoactive 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2nX3bKtM98uLsNbfyJyjBC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4109" height="2311" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With a major event like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/amazon-prime-day">Amazon Prime Day</a> approaching, you may be hoping for a major deal to make Garmin watches more accessible. But having covered these events for years, I've found that Garmin tends to discount its watches based on these unofficial tiers.</p><p>Older Garmin Fenix or Epix models might drop by hundreds of dollars, but the latest mid-range watches will usually be discounted by $100, and budget Garmins might only receive a $50 discount. Use that information to set a realistic expectation: a mid-range Garmin watch will rarely fall into my baseline tier, even with an amazing deal.</p><p>If you're looking to get started with the Garmin brand at a reasonable price <em>and</em> with relatively new hardware, consider the 2025 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-vivoactive-6-review">Garmin Vivoactive 6</a>. My colleague, a recent Garmin convert and casual weightlifter, called it great "if you've never used Garmin before" for how it slow-rolls people into the ecosystem and confusing UI without overwhelming you; he especially appreciated the Strength Coach and walking recommendations.</p><p>(If you're looking to buy something now, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-v%C3%ADvoactive-Fitness-Smartwatch-Display/dp/B0CG6NBJ61"><strong>Vivoactive 5 is $100 off ($199)</strong></a>, with the same 1.2-inch AMOLED display, 11-day battery life, health sensors, all-systems GNSS accuracy, and aluminum bezel.)</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="SDfb3CqChaNnV4YouNkmcA" name="Garmin-Forerunner-165-run-power-zones.jpeg" alt="The post-run Run Power Zones on the Garmin Forerunner 165." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SDfb3CqChaNnV4YouNkmcA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>My next recommendation (and personal fave in the budget category) is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-165-review">Garmin Forerunner 165</a>. You get the same 11-day battery life, 1.2-inch AMOLED, and GNSS accuracy as the Vivoactive 6. It's less attractive and misses out on dozens of the Vivoactive's sports modes, but you get an altimeter added for elevation tracking — vital for hikers and runners — and daily suggested run workouts.</p><p>I wish it had tools like the Forerunner 265's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-training-load-focus-needs-one-obvious-fix">training load</a> or the Forerunner 970's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-forerunner-970-running-tolerance-tool-too-useful-to-be-premium-feature">running tolerance</a>, but the Forerunner 165 gets runners started with Garmin Coach, training effect, and post-run recovery suggestions without overwhelming you. It's currently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Forerunner-Smartwatch-Colorful-Training/dp/B0CT3SGHXL"><strong>$40 off on Amazon, near an all-time low</strong></a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VxGCm8dpYqd2VyKhsu5wVn" name="Garmin Lily 2 Active" alt="Garmin Lily 2 Active" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VxGCm8dpYqd2VyKhsu5wVn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p>My final Garmin rec for beginners, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-lily-2-active-launch-details">Garmin Lily 2 Active</a>, isn't one I've personally used, but I was surprised to see my sister Megan bought one (without any recommendation from me) and loves it.</p><p>Unlike short-lived Garmin hybrids like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-vivomove-trend-review">Vivomove Trend</a> with no built-in GPS, the Lily 2 Active lasts nine days, or nine hours with GPS. But it still looks stylish thanks to its aluminum bezel and patterned lens background, and at just 29g and 11mm thick, it's comfortably light.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Stylish-Smartwatch-Patterned-Silicone/dp/B0DGWDRGP6"><strong>Lily 2 Active</strong></a> isn't for you if you need an AMOLED display or the most advanced features, but many people <em>don't</em>! What they want from Garmin is accurate health data like heart rate, stress, blood oxygen, sleep stages, breathing, steps, and menstrual cycle tracking. You can still follow on-device strength workouts or meditation guidance, but otherwise, this is a simple and attractive device to ease you into the Garmin ecosystem!</p><h2 id="you-can-t-go-wrong-2">You can't go wrong</h2><p>Overall, the Garmin Vivoactive 6, Forerunner 165, and Lily 2 Active are my three recommended starting points for the brand! If you can't stomach compromise, you can always go for the Venu 3 to get Garmin's best health sensors, a stylish steel bezel, and a mic & speaker for Bluetooth calls.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Depending on the phone you're using and how big or small your hands are, stretching way up to tap something into the address bar was a pain for some folks. Now it should be less of a pain.</p><p>More importantly, and something Google often forgets, <em>you have the option</em>. Options are good because they're what allow everyone to make something work a little better for them.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-move-your-chrome-address-bar-to-the-bottom"><span>How to move your Chrome address bar to the bottom</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:717px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.65%;"><img id="CpEVmC2LhUASBxJ3pD8rCY" name="chrome-address-bar" alt="Screenshot of the Chrome address bar positioning." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CpEVmC2LhUASBxJ3pD8rCY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="717" height="399" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Having the option does no good if you don't know how to use it. In this case, it's pretty simple.</p><p>1. Wait until Google sends the ability to your account. Even tiny changes can break stuff, so Google always rolls out features slowly. It will get there.</p><p>2. Long-press on the address bar itself, then choose the <strong>Move address bar to bottom</strong> option.</p><p>3. Alternatively, open the Chrome settings and look for the entry labeled '<strong>address bar</strong>' to decide where to place it.</p><p>Once you've placed it where you want it, it should stay in place. Since I don't have the option, I have no idea if it can break anything else. If it does, Google will stop sending it out and attempt to fix the issue.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-all-about-the-choice"><span>All about the choice</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="74kWcvamGrLAHsmCve5Wee" name="Motorola-Razr-2024-review-04.jpg" alt="The Motorola Razr 2024 open with the display on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/74kWcvamGrLAHsmCve5Wee.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As I mentioned, it's important that Google gives us a choice this time, just like Microsoft does with the Edge browser. Letting users decide what they like is always the best way and often the <em>right</em> way to do anything.</p><p>We all have different-sized hands and fingers. There are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">a lot of phones</a> out there of every shape and size. Some people need to move the bar down low, while others don't. It's really that simple.</p><p>How you hold a phone can matter, too. I have larger-than-normal-sized hands, so I can reach it if it's up top. But I have noticed that I hold a phone like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> differently than I hold my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2024-review">Motorola Razr</a>.</p><p>On the Razr, I want to move it down to the bottom. On the Pixel, I want to keep it at the top. Having the choice means it works for me on both phones.</p><p>Individually, none of us is so special that Google needs to change something to satisfy us. But as a whole, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-io-android-3-billion-active-devices">Android is all about its users</a>; it wouldn't exist without us. Something small, like providing options to make your software better for everyone, is the way to go, Google. Let's see more of it.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The tipster highlighted some alleged "exclusive information" about the compact flagship, which could receive a key element: Qualcomm's upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-2">Snapdragon 8 Elite 2</a>. This isn't surprising, per se, as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-13t-smal-display-flagship-power-china-launch">OnePlus 13T</a> grabbed the SD 8 Elite, like the original 13 flagship.</p><p>More than that, DCS claims the OnePlus 15T will sport a bigger battery than the expected OnePlus 15 flagship. No details were given about its purported capacity just yet.</p><p>Considering this will likely be another compact device, rumors add the 15T could rock a 6.3-inch 1.5K resolution display.

While we're still expecting OnePlus to stick with its strong <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-introduces-new-glacier-battery-featuring-6100mah">Glacier battery tech</a>, the OnePlus 13 and 13T had a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-13t-smal-display-flagship-power-china-launch">similar occurrence take place</a> this year. The former launched with a strong 6,000mAh battery; however, the 13T took that up a little with its 6,260mAh battery.</p><p>Considering how early these rumors are, it's unclear how much larger the OnePlus 15's battery could be (if there's an upgrade in the cards). There's speculation that the Chinese OEM could keep it at 6,000mAh with a boost ready for the 15T, but that remains to be seen.</p><p>Since the 15T will more likely than not play off the OnePlus 15, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-specs-chipset-camera-leaks">some recent leaks</a> could give us an idea of what to expect. One similar thing is its supposed 1.5K resolution for its screen. Though things change as the flagship could sport a 6.7-inch display with that. There are conflicting rumors about its primary camera. Some claim it will land at 50MP while others suggest OnePlus could kick it up to 200MP.</p><p>Regardless, OnePlus flagships usually launch in China first, toward the end of the year, in the fall. This timeline could shift slightly earlier this year, following rumors that the Snapdragon 8 Elite 2<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/early-snapdragon-8-elite-2-quicker-summit-phone-launch-rumors"> could launch in September</a>, not October.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The company states users should find its payment option available during checkout while shopping online on "select" Android apps and websites. Klarna's chief commercial officer, David Sykes, said, "Integrating with Google Pay marks a meaningful step in Klarna’s mission to bring flexible, transparent payments to where consumers already are."</p><p>Klarna is positioned to enhance Google Pay's available Buy Now, Pay Later choices when purchasing expensive products. The post states users will have access to Klarna's "Pay in four payments" feature. This lets you submit "four fixed payments" that are interest-free for purchases over $35.</p><p>The company adds, "Financing is available for higher ticket items with monthly repayments made over a longer period of time starting at 0% APR."</p><p>It might take a little while before Klarna shows up when purchasing items in supported apps/websites on Android with Google Pay.</p><h2 id="more-choices-better-shopping-2">More Choices, Better Shopping</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="pWThapBgXmQHVgMJ7HiwjS" name="Google-Pay-hero.jpeg" alt="Google Pay app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pWThapBgXmQHVgMJ7HiwjS.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google Pay's BNPL (buy now, pay later) function <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pay-adds-new-features-to-make-online-shopping-less-of-a-nightmare">saw an expansion last year</a>, when the company introduced Affirm and Zip. With these third-party providers, consumers could pay more comfortably for items across more websites and apps. Similar to Klarna, it's worth keeping an eye on when your next installment's due date is to avoid missing it.</p><p>Google also improved the way users interact with their card information when paying. That update brought in the ability to confirm crucial card details without its security code, but instead with your fingerprint. Consumers could also opt for typing in a PIN or using facial recognition, too.</p><p>On a related note, Google Wallet's been rumored to have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-nfc-card-adding-function-tipped">a seamless, NFC-based card-adding feature</a> in the works. Some early signs suggest that all users would need to do is hold their desired card close to their device "until it vibrates." Your phone, leveraging its NFC, would grab its details and input them in their appropriate areas. This would only (seemingly) work for cards that are EMV compliant.</p><p>More importantly, this feature will leave the most critical detail to you: the card's CVV. There's also a lot more planned for NFC on phones, with the NFC Forum highlighting its ambitions to give users more things to do with a "single tap."</p> ]]></dc:content>

It’s considered the “strongest layer of security” for protecting not only your devices but also your Google Account. All you need to do is enroll, and you can take advantage of the added protection against hacks, malware, unsafe apps, and thieves. The best part? It’s free!</p><h2 id="how-to-enable-advanced-protection-on-a-google-pixel-phone-2">How to enable Advanced Protection on a Google Pixel phone</h2><p>1. Open the <strong>Settings app</strong> on your Google Pixel phone.</p><p>2. Scroll down and select <strong>Security and Privacy.</strong></p><p>3. If this is the first time you’re accessing this setting from the device after the Android 16 update, select <strong>See details</strong> under Advanced Protection.

Combined with other security features, it’s one of the reasons the latest Google Pixel phones rank among <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-phone-security">the most secure Android phones</a>.</p><p><strong>Device theft protection</strong>: This locks your phone automatically if motion indicates potential theft, like the phone is grabbed furiously and then moves in rapid motion, suggesting it was confiscated. The phone also automatically locks when the device is offline and restarts if it’s locked for three days.</p><p><strong>App protection</strong>: The phone scans Google Play for unsafe apps and malware and blocks the installation of apps from unknown sources. If there’s an app you want or need that isn’t in the Google Play store, and thus isn’t considered a trusted source, you won’t be able to download it.</p><p>Even some apps in the Play Store may not have received approval for download with Advanced Protection. In these instances, you’ll receive a warning. You should only install this app if it’s from a trusted developer. To go ahead and install it anyway, go to <em>See details</em> on the app page, select <em>Continue to install</em>, then Install.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="78AKgsT4vMSXBJk7k5qPYF" name="Google Pixel Advanced Protection" alt="Google Advanced Protection" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/78AKgsT4vMSXBJk7k5qPYF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Christine Persaud / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Network protection</strong>: On compatible devices, the phone will avoid unsecure 2G networks to prevent you from connecting to a vulnerable network.</p><p><strong>Web protection</strong>: Harmful webpages will be blocked, and you’ll receive warnings before visiting non-HTTPS websites via the Chrome browser. Some advanced capabilities will also be turned off to reduce risks via JavaScript protections.</p><h2 id="what-else-to-know-about-advanced-protection-2">What else to know about Advanced Protection</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xFcUb3nVmMUNe2hzrtRmVF" name="Google Pixel Advanced Protection" alt="Google Advanced Protection" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xFcUb3nVmMUNe2hzrtRmVF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Christine Persaud / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What might be the reason you <em>don’t </em>want to enable Advanced Protection? As noted, it can limit what apps you can install on the device to just approved ones from the Google Play Store, Android Debug Bridge, and preinstalled Android app store apps. If there are other essential apps you need for work or specific projects, you might have to turn them off.</p><p>If you don’t want to enroll in Advanced Protection, there are things you can manually do on your Google Pixel phone to still ensure your private information stays that way. Download the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-is-google-play-protect">Google Play Protect</a> app and use it to manually scan the device to look for potentially harmful software. The advantage with Advanced Protection, however, is that this step is done automatically for you.</p><p>Given all the benefits of Advanced Protection, like automatically turning on theft detection, enabling protections for scams and spam in Google Messages, and ensuring you can’t disable features like the Google Play Protect malware protection and Android Safe Browsing, it’s worth considering. The best part is that if you decide it’s too restrictive and you want to handle your own safeguards beyond the standard Google Pixel security features, you can reverse the steps above to turn Advanced Protection off at any time.</p><p>Google Advanced Protection is available for all Pixel phones from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> and later, including ones that rank among <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">the best Android phones</a> you can buy right now.

The post reiterates Google's previous shift to TSMC after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/is-googles-switch-from-samsung-foundry-to-tsmc-for-the-tensor-g5-chip-a-big-deal">spending time with Samsung</a> for its Tensor chip development.

However, one thing that's is that we're expecting this chip to power the Pixel 11 series in 2026.</p><p>The overseas publication's sources didn't chime in with more info about the SoC. Not surprising, especially given how early this rumor has surfaced—and things can always change.

A huge leak from Google's gChips Division suggests the Pixel 11 series could receive several "Video Generation ML" tools for video editing capabilities.

It seems we're still in for the same four phones this year, those being a Pixel 10, 10 Pro, 10 Pro XL, and a 10 Pro Fold. Following an early and sold-out case listing by Thinborne, there might be some subtle physical element shifts, such as the SIM slot, USB-C port, and speaker cutouts.

With the new Pad 3, that's all changed. The tablet now features a boxy, rectangular design language similar to the Samsung Galaxy Tab lineup.</p><p>That includes flat edges, a rear camera positioned in the back corner, and uniform bezels. In fact, our reviewer said, "the more I looked at the latest OnePlus tablet, the more I realized how much it reminded me of the iPad Pro and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review">Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra</a>." In a way, the OnePlus Pad 3 feels more premium, but it's also becoming just like many of the other tablets on the market today.</p><p>OnePlus has made a significant change to the Pad 3's display, as it now measures 13.2 inches. However, the size is the only aspect changed about the OnePlus Pad 3's display, as it remains an IPS LCD panel with a 144Hz refresh rate and a 900 nits peak brightness rating. For some, this will be a disappointment. However, LCDs do have advantages in certain areas and are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">friendly for PWM-sensitive people</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="VJ8LiPqZCbMBBX2og6cSUR" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review-3" alt="Console Launcher on Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VJ8LiPqZCbMBBX2og6cSUR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Meanwhile, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra ends up feeling more like a laptop than a tablet due to its even larger form factor. While the OnePlus Pad 3 is one of the biggest Android tablets on the market, the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra's 14.6-inch screen is just that much bigger.

That is certainly the case here. OnePlus improved its software support guarantee this year, offering three years of Android OS upgrades for the Pad 3. It starts with Android 15, so it should see Android upgrades at least through Android 18. On top of that, you'll get six total years of security patches.</p><p>Samsung crushes that with seven years of Android OS upgrades and security patches for the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra. It did launch with Android 14, so it has already received one of those upgrades to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a>-based <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review">One UI 7</a>. Still, it is better support than OnePlus offers for the Pad 3. You'll have to decide whether the extra cost of the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra is worth the extended software support window.</p><p>Finally, it's worth considering whether you need a lot of AI tools on your tablet. The Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra has a full suite of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI features</a>, plus Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> offerings.

That's not to say Samsung doesn't add things to justify the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra's asking price — an OLED screen, the biggest display size in an Android tablet, and DeX support are all key additions. It's just unlikely that <em>not</em> having these things on the OnePlus Pad 3 will be a dealbreaker for most tablet users.</p><p>When you consider the cost savings, the $700 OnePlus Pad 3 feels like the easy recommendation for people wanting a powerful Android tablet.

But some digging into the app’s latest version uncovered hidden text hints that Google is planning to give users a friendly nudge to switch it on soon.</p><p>A recent APK teardown by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/messages-rcs-notices-3569341/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> reveals that Google is preparing a new feature that auto-fills a prompt to send to friends still stuck on SMS. If you're not using RCS yet, expect a friendly nudge from your RCS-using buddies to finally flip the switch.</p><p>When Google Messages spots that someone is still on SMS, you’ll get a “Text an invite” option.

Still, there's something about the Pixel Watch that just doesn't catch my interest. Maybe it's the small-feeling screen, waterdrop design, the short battery life, or the dark user interface.</p><p>Either way, after a few failed attempts to switch to a Pixel Watch, it's clear the popular Google smartwatch simply isn't for me. The device doesn't feel as useful or engaging as others I've worn from Apple, Samsung, Garmin, and OnePlus. For around the same price as the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Google Pixel Watch</a>, there are a few smartwatches that I think do a better job of earning a spot on your wrist.</p><p>If you're like me — an Android phone user that doesn't think a Pixel Watch is the right fit — these are the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best wearables</a> you should look at instead. And with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-2025-early-deals-and-faq">Amazon Prime Day</a> just around the corner, there's a chance that some or all of these devices may be on sale, making it a great time to snag a new smartwatch.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-watch-7"><span>Samsung Galaxy Watch 7</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7vBWqR7YmxhZ8GXJvnJtgf" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review-lemon-lime-ultra-info-board-2.jpg" alt="Ultra Info Board on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7vBWqR7YmxhZ8GXJvnJtgf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ara Wagoner / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While the Pixel Watch is getting better and better each year, I think the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Samsung Galaxy Watch 7</a> should still be the default wearable for Android users. Samsung has been making "smart" wearables for longer, and it shows in the Galaxy Watch 7. Although the Google Pixel Watch takes influence from the company's Fitbit acquisition, it isn't always a positive influence. For instance, you need a Fitbit Premium subscription to get the complete fitness experience.</p><p>Arguably, my biggest complaint with the Pixel Watch is that I find its dark UI to be gloomy and not engaging. It's designed this way to hide the Pixel Watch's large black bezels and preserve battery life, but it falls flat in my experience. The Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 and the Pixel Watch 3 both have displays rated at 2,000 nits of peak brightness, but Samsung's watch looks better and brighter due to design and UI choices.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="WQbshdpZ6mYeN6wdpY8bQg" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review-3d-watch-face.jpg" alt="3D watch face on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WQbshdpZ6mYeN6wdpY8bQg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2249" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ara Wagoner / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One UI 6 Watch is excellent, and Samsung's collaboration with Google for Wear OS means many features are consistent across Pixel and Galaxy Watch models. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-gemini-galaxy-watch-buds-integration-announcement">Gemini is coming to the Galaxy Watch 7 soon</a>, for example. You also get exclusive features, and Samsung's Exynos W1000 chip will make this watch feel snappy.</p><p>I also prefer the flat display and the rugged design of the Galaxy Watch 7 to that of the Pixel Watch 3. All of these benefits, plus the longer software support window, make the Galaxy Watch 7 easy for me to recommend over Google's option.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="e2831ffc-dece-4ecb-8082-9bcef47ba939">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wLi7evGVaHkcR3en36atRn.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 7"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Watch 7</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The best Wear OS watch</strong></em></p><p>For most people, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 is the best Wear OS watch out there.

When I tested the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2r-review">OnePlus Watch 2R</a> last year, I was impressed by the device's sleek design, fitness and health features, and smooth UI at its price point. The newer OnePlus Watch 3 takes that to the next level while retaining 100-hour battery life. You'll probably have to charge the Pixel Watch 3 every day, but the OnePlus Watch 3 will give you a few days between charges.</p><p>OnePlus is a smaller company, and that means the Watch 3 will be a lot less universal than the Pixel Watch 3 or Galaxy Watch 7. There's no LTE option here, which is a bummer, and the same goes for the ECG feature. If you can live without those options — I know I definitely can — the OnePlus Watch 3 is easier to view as a real option. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-expands-its-mid-tier-lineup">smaller size incoming</a> helps, too.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="XGMfVFB3GyuriuV4tB2hi" name="oneplus-watch-3-workout-watch-face-with-shoes-01" alt="A OnePlus Watch 3 with a fitness watch face on a pair of workout shoes" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XGMfVFB3GyuriuV4tB2hi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What I really love about OnePlus Watch models is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-hands-on">how engaging their fitness and health tools feel</a>. They're bright and colorful, with charts and rings that make you want to dive into your workout insights. It reminds me of how Apple Watches inspire people to improve their fitness, though crucially, without the pressure that comes with wanting to close their Apple Watch rings every day.</p><p>If you're an outdoor adventurer, runner, or general fitness nerd, I think the OnePlus Watch 3 makes a great case against the Pixel Watch 3. The insights, functionality, and presentation are just better and more helpful, and it won me over.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="7dd1b010-198f-4742-a960-08e8a83d1246">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AneZzpatZ7PriQ6DuceUsf.jpg' alt="OnePlus Watch 3"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">OnePlus Watch 3</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The battery life champ</strong></em></p><p>The OnePlus Watch 3 might be the antithesis of the Pixel Watch 3, as it's large, bulky, and loud.

I was, too, but I recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-ditched-my-apple-and-galaxy-watches-for-a-garmin-and-you-should-too">made the leap from Wear OS and watchOS devices to GarminOS</a>, and haven't looked back. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-vivoactive-6-review">Garmin Vivoactive 6</a> is a sneaky Pixel Watch 3 alternative — perhaps the best one on this list. That's because the Vivoactive 6 preserves the small and subtle aesthetic of the Pixel Watch 3 while providing an experience I think will be more complete.</p><p>It's available in four fun colors — Slate, Lunar Gold, Metallic Jasper Green, and Metallic Pink Dawn — but doesn't have as many durability concerns as the Pixel Watch 3. The Garmin Vivoactive 6 has a flat display with Gorilla Glass 3, a fiber-reinforced polymer case, and an anodized aluminum bezel. Best of all, the entire thing weighs 36 grams, including the strap.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4109px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="2nX3bKtM98uLsNbfyJyjBC" name="Garmin-Vivoactive-6-review-12" alt="A workout animation on the Garmin Vivoactive 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2nX3bKtM98uLsNbfyJyjBC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4109" height="2311" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>By leaving Wear OS behind, battery life gains become paramount. In smartwatch mode, you can get 11 days out of the Vivoactive 6, which should be a refreshing change of pace. Even Garmin's older v4 Elevate HR sensor is great, making the Vivoactive 6 comparable to newer options from brands like Google and Samsung.</p><p>For me, switching to a Garmin and prioritizing health insights over "smart" features was the right call. If that sounds intriguing to you, the Garmin Vivoactive 6 could be a better pick than the Pixel Watch 3.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="d1198b2d-dca8-4055-a9f5-f1a6669f9d6c">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/secwvVBDhnoMFv8tL5mbJ6.jpg' alt="The Garmin Vivoactive 6 against a white background."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Garmin Vivoactive 6</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>A fitness-first competitor</strong></em></p><p>The Garmin Vivoactive 6 ditches Wear OS in favor of battery life and fitness features, and for some, it'll be worth it.

Motorola <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/moto-edge-2025-ai-key-stylish-design-launch">launched</a> the Edge 2025 in May with upgrades given to the camera, battery, processor, and display. It even has a dedicated AI Key, similar to what we saw on the Motorola Razr Ultra. The single RAM and storage variant costs $550 in the U.S., which doesn't sound too bad at first, but there's also heavy competition to consider.</p><p>The Google Pixel 9a is currently one of the best cheap phones in this segment, and the Motorola Edge 2025 goes directly up against it. The Pixel offers great AI features, years of software updates, fantastic battery life, and a more compact form factor. Deciding between these two devices can be tricky if you're not familiar with their offerings, but this Motorola Edge 2025 vs. Pixel 9a comparison can help.</p><h2 id="motorola-edge-2025-vs-google-pixel-9a-design-display-2">Motorola Edge 2025 vs. Google Pixel 9a: Design & display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ms9nJVnkvpq6X9HkQ9phmC" name="Motorola-Edge-2025-home-screen-04" alt="The home screen of the Motorola Edge 2025 in its default configuration" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ms9nJVnkvpq6X9HkQ9phmC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-edge-2025-review">Motorola Edge 2025</a> follows a similar design language to the rest of the Moto G series, which launched in 2025. This means you get a vegan leather back panel, a four-lens cutout in the camera island, and tapering edges for a slim feel. In the U.S., the Edge 2025 comes in just a single color called Deep Forest, and just one variant with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. If you ask me, the limited choice of colors and storage is an indication that Motorola isn't entirely confident about this phone.</p><p>The Edge 2025 feels great to hold and use thanks to the vegan leather back panel. It's also quite slim at under 8mm in thickness, and light at just 181g. Motorola has enhanced the ingress protection this time, raising it to an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">IP69 rating</a>. This puts it on the same level as pricier phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>.</p><p>The brightness of the 6.7-inch pOLED display has been bumped up to 4,500 nits, and the resolution is still solid, giving it a pixel density of roughly 444 ppi. The scratch resistance has also improved, thanks to Corning Gorilla Glass 7i. The downside is that Motorola has reduced the refresh rate to 120Hz, down from 144Hz on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-2024-review">2024 Edge</a>. In practice, the lower refresh rate is not much of a deal-breaker as the display holds up well under sunlight and is very responsive for tasks like gaming.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="asxeqoV8jCKM9gVDtwZwx5" name="Google-Pixel-9a-Iris-2" alt="The Google Pixel 9a in Iris on a rock fixture." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/asxeqoV8jCKM9gVDtwZwx5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">Pixel 9a</a> comes in a multitude of colors and, like the Edge 2025, doesn't use glass for the back panel. This makes it less prone to damage in the event of a fall. Google has taken a different design approach, though, with flat sides and a minimal rear camera bump. The phone is also a lot more compact and pocketable thanks to the smaller display.</p><p>Speaking of which, you get a 6.3-inch pOLED panel with a similar pixel density as the Moto, and a 120Hz refresh rate. The scratch protection is only Gorilla Glass 3, which is inferior to what Motorola uses. The maximum brightness is also a lot lower at just 1,800 nits. While we didn't face any major issues using the 9a outdoors, Google still uses the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/my-phone-is-making-me-sick-and-im-not-alone">flicker-heavy PWM dimming</a> method for lowering the brightness, which can cause headaches if you're eyes are sensitive to it. There are also visibly thicker bezels around the display, which isn't very flattering to look at.</p><h2 id="motorola-edge-2025-vs-google-pixel-9a-hardware-specs-2">Motorola Edge 2025 vs. Google Pixel 9a: Hardware & specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rLBDKvxbe5ZsLeRVaNWxmN" name="Motorola-Edge-2025-back-06" alt="The vegan leather back of the forest green Motorola Edge 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rLBDKvxbe5ZsLeRVaNWxmN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Motorola Edge 2025 retails for $550 in the U.S. for the sole 256GB storage variant. You can get it unlocked or via your carrier, where the latter seems like the better route to buy it. The phone is powered by a MediaTek Dimensity 7400 Ultra SoC, which is a slight improvement from the Snapdragon powering the 2024 Edge model, but it's not fast enough. During our review, we frequently encountered lag and stuttering when using apps or navigating the interface.</p><p>Even Minecraft on the Vibrant Visuals setting wouldn't run smoothly. The other main reason this feels overpriced in the U.S. is that Motorola sells the same phone under a different name (Edge 60/Fusion) in other countries like India for nearly half the cost (Rs. 23,000 or roughly $270).</p><p>Motorola has beefed up the cameras for sure if you compare the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-edge-2025-vs-edge-2024">Edge 2025 vs. the 2024 Edge</a>. We now have a 50MP ultrawide that also doubles as a macro camera, and a 10MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom. There's even a 50MP selfie camera with autofocus, which should capture more detailed images than the Pixel 9a. Motorola has managed to offer a slightly larger 5,200mAh battery in the Edge 2025 with an insanely quick 68W fast wired charging. There's even 15W wireless charging.</p><div ><table><caption>Specifications</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Category</strong></p></th><th  ><p><strong>Motorola Edge 2025</strong></p></th><th  ><p><strong>Google Pixel 9a</strong></p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>OS</strong></p></td><td  ><p>Android 15</p></td><td  ><p>Android 15 (upgradable to Android 16)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Software Promise</strong></p></td><td  ><p>2 OS upgrades</p><p>3 years of security updates</p></td><td  ><p>7 years of OS upgrades</p><p>7 years of security updates</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Colors</strong></p></td><td  ><p>Pantone Deep Forest</p></td><td  ><p>Obsidian, Porcelain, Peony, Iris</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Screen Size</strong></p></td><td  ><p>6.7 inches</p></td><td  ><p>6.3 inches</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Screen Resolution</strong></p></td><td  ><p>2,712 x 1,220</p></td><td  ><p>2,424 x 1,080</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Screen Type </strong></p></td><td  ><p>pOLED Super HD</p></td><td  ><p>pOLED FHD+</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Refresh Rate</strong></p></td><td  ><p>120Hz</p></td><td  ><p>120Hz</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Processor</strong></p></td><td  ><p>MediaTek Dimensity 7400</p></td><td  ><p>Google Tensor G4</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>RAM</strong></p></td><td  ><p>8GB</p></td><td  ><p>8GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Storage</strong></p></td><td  ><p>256GB</p></td><td  ><p>128GB/ 256GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Cameras</strong></p></td><td  ><p>50MP main, 50MP ultrawide with macro, 10MP telephoto, 50MP front</p></td><td  ><p>48MP main, 13MP ultrawide, 13MP front</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Speakers</strong></p></td><td  ><p>Stereo Speakers (Dolby Atmos)</p></td><td  ><p>Stereo Speakers (Dolby Atmos)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Battery</strong></p></td><td  ><p>5,200mAh</p></td><td  ><p>5,100mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Charging</strong></p></td><td  ><p>68W wired, 15W wireless</p></td><td  ><p>23W wired, 7.5W wireless</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Bluetooth</strong></p></td><td  ><p>5.4</p></td><td  ><p>5.3</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Water Resistance</strong></p></td><td  ><p>IP68/IP69</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Cellular</strong></p></td><td  ><p>5G</p></td><td  ><p>5G</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Size</strong></p></td><td  ><p>161.19 x 73.06 x 7.99mm</p></td><td  ><p>154.7 x 73.3 x 8.9mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Weight</strong></p></td><td  ><p>181 grams</p></td><td  ><p>185.8 grams</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="T59tVwzcwoKR8dyxhLEtuj" name="Google-Pixel-9a-on-bench" alt="The Google Pixel 9a sitting on a bench next to a reading gnome." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/T59tVwzcwoKR8dyxhLEtuj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Google Pixel 9a starts at $499 for 128GB of storage and $599 for 256GB. Comparing the same storage tiers of both phones, the Edge 2025 does come out a bit cheaper, but it's still not enough. The Pixel 9a has a more potent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> SoC, which delivers better performance for AI tasks, apps, and gaming. When we tested it, the 9a ran flawlessly with no lag or stuttering issues.</p><p>The Pixel 9a also has a great set of cameras. Despite the lower resolution than the Edge 2025, Google's post-processing is far ahead of Motorola's capabilities. This isn't the best phone for zoom photography since it lacks a dedicated telephoto lens, but it's great for pretty much everything else.</p><p>Battery life is one of the strong suits of the Pixel 9a, thanks to the massive capacity. You should easily be able to get nearly two full days of usage out of this. Charging speeds are not the best when compared to the Motorola, sadly. The 9a has an ancient 23W fast charging over wire and measly 7.5W with a wireless charger.</p><h2 id="motorola-edge-2025-vs-google-pixel-9a-software-2">Motorola Edge 2025 vs. Google Pixel 9a: Software</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xEfKGfryXxX5DRtQTPWaCW" name="Motorola-Edge-2025-Moto-AI-02" alt="Moto AI running on a Motorola Edge 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xEfKGfryXxX5DRtQTPWaCW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Motorola Edge 2025 ships with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a>, but will be getting just two OS upgrades and three years of security patches. That's a bit low even for a $550 phone since the Pixel 9a is supported for seven years. The Edge 2025 comes with some of the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a> features that debuted with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Motorola Razr Ultra</a> earlier this year.

These features can be accessed via the dedicated AI key, and many of them are pretty useful.</p><p>The Pixel 9a does not have a dedicated AI button, but the AI features are far more impressive. It shipped with Android 15 but has since received Android 16, and it stands to get seven years of OS and security updates. The 9a supports some of the newer AI features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-add-me-google-pixel-9">Add Me</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-astrophotography-mode-google-pixel">Astrophotography</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-use-macro-focus-on-pixel-7-pro">Macro Focus.</a> The phone runs a slightly watered-down version of Gemini, called Gemini Nano, for on-device AI tasks.

It's a more powerful phone that's more pocketable, has way longer software updates, superb battery life, and a unique design.</p><p>The Edge 2025 is simply too expensive in the U.S. for what it offers, and only makes sense if you get it at a heavy subsidy via your carrier, or during a sale. Even so, keep in mind that the processor is a bit weak for gaming, you're only getting two OS upgrades, and it looks just like any other Moto G series phone.</p><p>The Edge 2025 does have its appeal in countries like India, where it sells for nearly half the price.

The Meta Quest 3S is already a value-focused VR headset, but the inclusion of a pre-installed Elite Strap (a $70 value), an Xbox controller (a $65 value), 3 months of Gamepass Ultimate (a $60 value), and 3 months of Horizon+ (a $24 value). That's <strong>$119 worth of stuff you're getting for free</strong>, plus the fact that there's no other way to get this black-and-green-themed bundle.</p><p>The Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition can play all the latest Quest 3-exclusive games like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/batman-arkham-shadow-review">Batman Arkham Shadow</a>, plus all the VR classics like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/assassins-creed-nexus-vr-review">Assassin's Creed Nexus</a> and Beat Saber. In addition, you get access to a giant, resizable virtual screen to play regular Xbox games on anywhere you're sitting, whether that's in your living room or on a plane.</p><p>While the Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition won't hook up to the Xbox in your living room — like a PlayStation VR2 hooks up to a PS5 — it's totally wireless and can play Xbox games so long as you have Gamepass and internet access.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="AaW5gmbysM6HcZMaMoTTbM" name="meta-quest-3s-xbox-edition-official-lifestyle-minecraft-dungeons" alt="An official lifestyle image of someone playing Minecraft Dungeons using a Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition headset" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AaW5gmbysM6HcZMaMoTTbM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1536" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Microsoft / Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The big draw of using a Meta Quest 3S for Game Pass is that you get a completely personal screen to play on that can be moved anywhere you want. That eliminates neck fatigue brought on by holding a handheld console for a long time, and it also means that you don't need to hog up the TV to play the games you want. It also means you can play those mature Xbox games in the same room your kids are watching Baby Shark without them seeing you tear up demons in Doom.</p><p>It's a similar experience to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">best Smart glasses</a>, but having a headset on means you get a much wider field of view and also get the option to play <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/one-year-later-mixed-reality-games-are-booming">mixed reality games</a> or even fully immersive VR games when you want.</p><p>If you want to learn more, check out our sister site Windows Central's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/meta-quest-3s-xbox-edition-hands-on-review">Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition hands-on</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

And to celebrate its 20th birthday, Google Earth is rolling out a nostalgic update: historical Street View, now baked right into the Earth experience.</p><p>What started as a 3D map app is now a massive time machine in your pocket, full of satellite snapshots, rare discoveries, and even Hollywood-worthy reunions. With its latest update, you can now hop into Street View and roll back the clock to see how your city or street looked a decade or two ago.</p><p>This feature even got social media buzzing recently with #somewhereonGoogleMaps as people <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps-earth-street-view-expands-ai">virtually time-traveled to see how places evolved</a> and find their loved ones in imagery.</p><h2 id="from-fun-to-life-changing-2">From fun to life-changing</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2496px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:63.86%;"><img id="HCQV5nDPNUzxJJ387LqD3E" name="Google-Earth-overhead-image" alt="Overhead image from Google Earth" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HCQV5nDPNUzxJJ387LqD3E.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2496" height="1594" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Beyond the fun of virtual tourism, Google Earth has racked up some pretty impressive milestones. Back in 2005, it was downloaded 100 million times in its first week. When Hurricane Katrina hit just months later, first responders used updated satellite views from Google Earth to coordinate disaster response.</p><p>Over the years, Google Earth has quietly helped discover coral reefs, ancient human relatives, and even long-lost family members. In 2016, Saroo Brierley used Earth imagery to retrace his childhood journey and reconnect with his birth mother in India—25 years later. That story turned into the Oscar-nominated film Lion.</p><p>In 2012, Google ditched the satellites and flew a little closer to Earth—literally. It used helium balloons and kites to snap aerial photos over Oakland, California, kicking off the era of community-captured imagery. Fast forward to today, and you’ve got professionals using Google Earth to evaluate solar panel viability and building designs before even setting foot onsite.</p><h2 id="ai-for-the-planet-2">AI for the planet</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:51.44%;"><img id="srSPLq4XbNfVVzKqSeXwrj" name="Houston-3D-image-Google-Earth" alt="3D image on Google Earth showing parts of Houston" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/srSPLq4XbNfVVzKqSeXwrj.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="823" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Beyond letting everyday folks geek out on geography, Google Earth is giving us AI-powered insights.

It's the standard — and required by law in some places, like the EU — but not all USB-C cables are made equal. That's why your charger probably needs an upgrade, and a cable with a screen might be the thing you didn't know you needed.</p><p>There are a ton of different specs supported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-cables-adapters">USB-C cables</a>, including Thunderbolt, USB4/USB5, Power Delivery, DisplayPort Alt Mode, and many more. Keeping track can be tricky, and using the wrong cable or power adapter could mean leaving charging speed or features on the table. To get the most out of your device, you need the right charging equipment.</p><p>I bought a USB-C cable with a screen from a random, no-name brand three years ago, mostly expecting it to be a gimmick. After all, I paid less than $10 for it, and had almost zero faith it would do what it claimed to. Fast forward to 2025, and the cheap cable I bought with a screen in 2022 is still working, and has been a game-changer for my charging habits. Here's why this cable changed my mind, and why you should get one too.</p><h2 id="a-basic-led-on-a-usb-c-cable-isn-t-overdoing-it-2">A basic LED on a USB-C cable isn't overdoing it</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="q4zWRThovvkU45jF7kP4GR" name="SooPii-USBC-Cable-1" alt="A SooPii USB-C cable connected to a power bank and a MacBook Air." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/q4zWRThovvkU45jF7kP4GR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Charging speed is arguably more important than battery life. Yes, having a long-lasting phone, tablet, or laptop is great, but it can be even better when a device supports fast charging. Some phones, like OnePlus devices in China, support impressive 100W charging speeds — or better. Even the latest iPhones, Google Pixel phones, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Samsung Galaxy phones</a> can do better than the 5W or 10W speeds of old.</p><p>The problem is, you won't get those handy top speeds by using any old power source and cable. Often, the cables included in the box with your device won't even cut it — you might need a USB-C cable or power adapter that supports faster speeds. Without a USB-C cable with a screen, you can't really tell which part of the charging system is the root of the issue.</p><p>That's why I exclusively carry <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Braided-Charging-Display-MacBook-Samsung/dp/B09HC4K3KP/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">this USB-C cable from SooPii. </a>It has a tiny, LED screen that shows the exact wattage your device is accepting from a power source. With it, I can figure out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/summer-travel-guide-2025-charging-accessories">which wall plugs or power banks</a> are actually giving my devices enough power. I use compact Anker Nano power adapters for charging my phone and earbuds, for instance, and save higher-wattage <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-anker-power-banks">Anker</a> and UGREEN adapters for tablets and laptops.</p><p>Some included wall plugs simply get disposed of because they aren't capable of delivering enough power. Without a USB-C cable with a display, I was flying blind, not knowing which power adapters or devices were charging funky. Now I have a bit more insight, and I didn't have to pay a premium for it — this cable has been consistently priced at around $8 and has lasted me years.</p><p>If you're in the market for a USB-C cable upgrade, don't scoff at ones with an LED screen. I thought it was a gimmick at first, but they quickly won me over.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="98aaa69d-ffbb-4571-ab92-c3e83cbd5b47">            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Braided-Charging-Display-MacBook-Samsung/dp/B09HC4K3KP" data-model-name="SooPii 100W USB-C cable"><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UMTpf4C3oqj6vbFwNZ3vbb.jpg' alt="A black SooPii USB-C cable with an LED against a white background."></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">SooPii 100W USB-C cable</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>An essential charging cable</strong></em></p><p>At under $10, getting a USB-C charging cable with an LED screen and 100W power delivery is impressive.

The retractable USB-C cable means you don't have to dig around in your bag to locate a cable, and it does an effective job charging devices at up to 67W.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You want more than two USB-C charging ports.</p><p>I used all the power banks Baseus released until now, and the Enercore shares a similar design with reliable build quality. The blue design is a little more distinctive than the gunmetal grey that's standard on most power banks, and while it picks up smudges, it isn't too glossy.</p><p>There's a built-in panel that shows remaining battery level, and the main attraction is the retractable USB-C cable that's tucked into the top of the Enercore. It doesn't stick out, and the USB-C connector has a magnet that ensures it stays attached to the chassis when you don't need the cable.</p><p>The cable goes up to 2.3 feet when fully extended, and it has four different lengths, so if you've got your phone next to the power bank, you don't need to extend it all the way. The flat cable has a tangle-free design, and it has been reliable in the week I used it — I tested it with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">9 Pro XL</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x200-ultra-review">Vivo X200 Ultra</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">X200 Pro</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review">Honor Magic V3</a>.</p><p>The retractable cable delivers up to a 67W charge over the USB PD protocol, and it has the standard power profiles: 5V/3A (15W), 9V/3A (27W), 12V/3A (36W), 15V/3A (45W), and 20V/3.35A (67W). The 20,000mAh battery ensures you can easily charge phones twice, and it delivers an efficiency of just over 60% — a decent showing in this category.</p><p>In addition to the retractable cable, you get a standard USB-C slot that can be used to charge a secondary device at up to 45W. This ports acts as the input, so you'll have to plug in a cable to charge the internal 20,000mAh battery. I didn't see any issues with overheating or charging various phones and accessories, and the Enercore has been just as reliable as its immediate rivals.</p><p>It is a decent recommendation at $59, but with the deal <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Baseus-Enercore-20000mAh-Retractable-Essential/dp/B0F3X1DLTD">bringing the price down to $44</a>, there's just no reason not to pick it up if you're interested in a new power bank.</p> ]]></dc:content>

But it’s not just shedding size—it's also rumored to be getting a durability upgrade, with better protection against both dust and water than the last model or any other foldables out there.</p><p>Following up on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>, the next-gen model might hit a big milestone—an IP68 rating, if a new report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-hinge" target="_blank">Android Headlines</a> is to be believed. If true, it’d be the first foldable to fully lock out dust and survive a splash, which is a pretty major first.</p><p>For anyone curious, IP ratings break down like this: the first number tells you how dustproof a device is, and the second one covers water resistance.</p><h2 id="foldables-dirty-little-secret-2">Foldables’ dirty little secret</h2><p>Most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">fan-favorite foldables</a> so far—like the Pixel 9 Pro Fold—only had IPX8, which means they’re good with water but not officially dustproof.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3vdxMY2tqLQZFRre938Rw4" name="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review-4.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold on fence railing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3vdxMY2tqLQZFRre938Rw4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Right now, Samsung holds the durability crown in the foldable segment, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> rocking IP48 ratings. But with the Galaxy Z Fold 7 aiming for IP68 and launching in July, Samsung could beat Google to the punch, since the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is tipped to land in August.</p><p>Durability isn’t the only upgrade on deck. Google’s also reworking the hinge on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold. That tweak should shrink the bezel around it and make room for a slightly bigger outer screen (6.4 inches vs. 6.3). The result is a slimmer build that not only feels better in your hand but also puts it right in the ring with Samsung’s Fold 7.</p><p>Google doesn’t seem obsessed with making the thinnest foldable, but the Pixel 10 Pro Fold should still be noticeably trimmer than last year’s model, and tougher at that. So even if it’s not breaking records, it’s shaping up to be a solid step forward.</p> ]]></dc:content>

While the chip's NPU can run up to "59 trillion operations per second (TOPS)," a noted 39% boost over <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-exynos-2400-comeback">the 2400</a> regarding AI, a big step arrives for its CPU. According to Samsung, the Exynos 2500's CPU features a 10-core structure (1+7+2).</p><p>The Korean OEM attributes its 15% boost in big core performance capabilities to the use of the "ultra-modern" Arm Cortex-X925 core.</p><p>Thanks to this, Samsung says the Exynos 2500 is capable of running "heavier apps" simultaneously without worry (and likely without causing too much strain on the phone). Graphics are important, especially when you're looking for a good flagship phone for mobile gaming. Samsung says it utilizes the fourth-generation Xclipse 950 GPU with the latest Exynos SoC.</p><p>It's also partnered with AMD to utilize its RDNA 3 architecture (again) for improved rendering speeds and hardware-accelerated ray tracing in games. Samsung adds in a separate note that it has boosted the available frames per second (FPS) in games by 28% with ray tracing enabled, a feature that typically demands a lot from a piece of hardware.</p><h2 id="the-next-gen-exynos-is-here-2">The next-gen Exynos is here</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1369px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:42.29%;"><img id="ZR98tdbu9ewtyYHiWCHrNe" name="samsung-exynos-2500-launch" alt="The Exynos 2500 brings notable AI improvements thanks to its upgraded NPU." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZR98tdbu9ewtyYHiWCHrNe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1369" height="579" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Other than the larger upgrades, Samsung detailed some of the smaller (yet equally important) specs for the Exynos 2500. Similar to the Exynos 2400, the 2500 supports 4K resolution displays at 120Hz. Moreover, its specs state the chip can support 8K resolution video recording at 30fps and 8K/60fps recordings.</p><p>Regarding photographs, Samsung says the chip can support a single (primary) camera at 320MP maximum. It also adds single camera 1080p/30fps and dual camera 64MP plus 32MP support.</p><p>Specifications include LPDDR5X memory support and UFS 4.0 storage.</p><p>The Exynos 2500 SoC's arrival comes after Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-fe-exynos-2500-impact-rumors">reportedly struggled with the chip's development</a>. In March, there were apparently uncertainties behind the chip's "production plan." As a result, it was rumored that Samsung <em>could </em>have to delay one of its devices.</p><p>More than that, Samsung's official debut of the Exynos 2500 comes at a time when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-z-flip-7-exynos-2500-chip-usage-rumored">there are rumors</a> of the Galaxy Z Flip 7 using the chip in May. Those rumors claimed the Flip 7 would do so in "most" places. So, it seems Samsung will explore a dual-chip strategy like it has done with devices previously. Speculation states regions like India and South Korea might use the Exynos 2500.</p><p>Other countries like the U.S., Canada, and China might pick up Qualcomm's chip, instead.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 chip with 4GB more RAM is closer to flagship-quality speed, and the Victus protection on the cover display makes it more likely to survive a drop.</p><p>On the other hand, its 4,000mAh battery capacity isn't the best; I've gotten accustomed to my long-lived <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">Pixel 9a</a> with 5,100mAh capacity, and I wouldn't want my phone dying on me mid-hike or run.</p><p>I may want to hold out for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Motorola Razr Ultra 2025</a>, which has even <em>faster</em> performance, extra battery capacity with 68W charging, and the best peak brightness of 3,000 nits for the cover display.

I appreciate that the Razr series is water resistant, but all it takes is some dust to mess up the inner display. Plus, all three models get <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-software-update-support">OS updates to Android 18</a>, so I'm hesitant to spend flagship-level money on the Razr Ultra when it won't stay on the cutting edge of features for long.</p><p>That's why I may decide to copy Brady and go for the base Motorola Razr 2025. Despite its downgrades compared to the Plus, I appreciate that it's more compact in hand and gets better battery life.</p><p>The Motorola Razr 2025 is normally $699, so getting the Plus for the same price right now is pretty great. But if the base model falls by a couple of hundred dollars for Prime Day — combined with a trade-in deal — and I can get this phone for the same price as a smartwatch? That would be pretty darn amazing.</p><p>So ultimately, I'm holding out for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/amazon-prime-day">Prime Day 2025</a> in the hopes of getting a great foldable deal! If the Razr isn't cheap enough, maybe Samsung will be trying to clear out stock on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>, and I can save on that instead.</p> ]]></dc:content>

These official-looking renders from Bass only double down on the chatter that the Galaxy Z Flip 7 may show up with a potential redesign, with more screen that will do more without having to flip the phone open.

Furthermore, the renders also suggest visually that the FE version looks a bit thicker than the standard Galaxy Z Flip 7.</p><p>As for the device's specs, previous rumors suggest that it could have a 6.7-inch primary screen and a 3.4-inch cover screen. The device is expected to have a 4,000 mAh battery and be powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-marketing-video-and-pricing-leak">Exynos 2400e chipset</a>.</p><p>As for the camera, the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE could have a 50MP primary lens, a 12MP ultra-wide angle lens,  and a 10MP shooter for selfies.

The Galaxy Watch 8's design sports a moderate black border/bezel around the face's circumference. The renders also show two physical buttons on one side.</p><p>Things take a turn when it comes to the Classic variant, renders show the alleged Galaxy Watch 8 Classic in a rugged and thicker, silver and black colorway, sporting what looks like a rotating bezel. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-gear/massive-galaxy-watch-8-classic-leak-all-but-confirms-its-squircle-look">Previous leaks </a>suggest that the Classic variant will supposedly arrive in a single size (47mm), with a 1.5-inch display, and will have a 450mAh battery capacity.</p><p>As for the Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025, which we've been hearing a lot lately, it could show up in a deep blue colorway with a smoother silver bezel surrounding the dial. It remains unclear if this watch will have a rotating bezel, as it seems to have a much smoother outer bezel without the ridges. The renders show the watch will possess the same two physical buttons seen on the other two models and an additional smaller orange button on one side.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming smartwatch, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p> ]]></dc:content>

The Pocket S2 Pro doesn't go <em>that</em> far, but it's still cool to see nevertheless.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qXpVZyPNAQNVVTfxXfJmL9" name="ayaneo-pocket-s2-lineup-on-table-press" alt="AYANEO Pocket S2 lineup on a table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qXpVZyPNAQNVVTfxXfJmL9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYANEO)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Lastly, AYANEO announced two "Limited Edition" models of the S2 Pro with the Retro Power and B.Duck color options.

The publication states the OEM informed it that the Magic V5 measures 8.8mm when folded. Honor adds that this marks an increasingly slimmer device over the past two iterations of the Magic V foldable series.</p><p>The Chinese OEM reiterates the Magic V2's 9.9mm size when folded and the V3's 9.2mm measurement. Honor is already dragging its competition—Samsung—into the mix, stating that it remains confident that the Magic V5 will not be beaten by the "thinner" Fold 7.</p><p>Elsewhere, in Honor's email, it thanks its "relentless pursuit of thinness" and "holistic design strategy behind the Magic V5's achievements. The company then teased a few upgrades for the Magic V5, such as its structural engineering improvements, bolstered materials, and "ultra-slim battery technology." The company didn't confirm what sort of battery we could see in the Magic V5 capacity-wise, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honors-next-foldable-phone-could-arrive-with-a-beastly-battery-upgrade">perhaps there's an upgrade in the books</a>.</p><h2 id="honor-wants-the-hilltop-2">Honor wants the Hilltop</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:337px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:178.04%;"><img id="ZKVekkX9QcbtwxJAvBQE5B" name="honor-magic-v5-thinnest-foldable-crown" alt="An image of the Honor Magic V5 from the side (closed), which is said to have an 8.8mm measurement." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZKVekkX9QcbtwxJAvBQE5B.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="337" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Honor)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Lastly, Honor says the Magic V5 will feature AI-powered processing features, which we've been expecting since MWC 2025.</p><p>Honor's been on a push with its Magic V5, as it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-announces-magic-v5-launch-date-mwc-shanghai">announced during MWC Shanghai</a> that the foldable will launch on July 2. This launch will concern China on that date. While Honor staked its claim that the Magic V5 will be the "thinnest" foldable, it shone a light on the phone as a "compelling alternative" for consumers. Honor says its Magic V5 will feature PC-like capabilities and loads of its AI software.</p><p>This AI software it briefly mentioned likely deals with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/honor-unveils-global-ai-strategy-with-usd-ten-billion">Alpha AI Plan</a>, announced during MWC in March. The company announced it would be a three-step strategy involving intelligent phones, an AI ecosystem, and AGI (Artificial General Intelligence). This new way forward for Honor has pushed it to invest ~$10 billion in this new AI strategy for its devices, all in the pursuit of more human-centric AI.</p> ]]></dc:content>

For many, a pair of truly wireless (TWS) earbuds or headphones is an essential that is carried with them every day. It makes sense — you want to watch videos, play games, listen to music, and generally hear audio without disturbing those around you. But if you only have one pair of headphones or earbuds for every situation, you're doing it wrong.</p><p>For a complete audio setup, you need three pairs of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">headphones and earbuds</a>. One pair of wireless earbuds for everyday listening, another for sleep or working out, and finally, a pair of over-ear headphones. If you have one pair of headphones in each of these three categories, you'll be covered for every type of situation.</p><p>You see, headphones and earbuds aren't a one-size-fits-all solution for all times and activities. Sometimes, you just need the right tool for the job. That tool could prioritize sound quality, comfort, fit, active noise-canceling, or battery life depending on the situation. You can cover all these needs with three pairs, and here are the ones I'd recommend.</p><h2 id="everyday-wear-samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-2">Everyday wear: Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="aLUy8iuHciU2NHQBpkHwui" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-ui-8-beta-1-auracast" alt="Using a pair of Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro to connect to an Auracast stream running on One UI 8 on a Samsnug Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aLUy8iuHciU2NHQBpkHwui.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The first pair of headphones everyone should own is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds" target="_blank">a pair of truly wireless earbuds</a> for everyday wear. These are the kind of headphones most people own, and for good reason — they're an essential. With a slim profile, decent sound quality, and great battery life, you can throw these in a pocket or bag and forget about them. When you need personal audio, you'll have it, even in times you weren't expecting to need headphones.</p><p>For most Android users, the pair of TWS earbuds to get is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro</a>. They get a lot of things right while often selling for less than their $250 list price. For starters, they're the only pair of earbuds I've tested that can match the AirPods Pro 2 in terms of active noise-canceling. Additionally, I <em>prefer</em> the sound quality of the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro to that of Apple's popular earbuds.</p><p>The sound signature feels fuller and louder, with more powerful bass that doesn't overshadow the rest of the sound you hear.

Truly wireless earbuds designed for everyday wear just aren't built for intense runs, gym workouts, or fitness activities.

The $449 retail price tag is steep compared to some members of the competition, for starters. Sonos does get a lot right in its first pair of over-ear headphones, including industry-leading comfort. If they were priced about $100 cheaper, they'd be an absolute slam-dunk buy, and that's why a deal from Walmart caught my eye.</p><p>The retailer is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1943169/565706/9383?subId1=ac-us-1122730035479278889&sharedId=hawk&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSonos-Ace-Wireless-Noise-Canceling-Headphones-Black%2F5902797595%3F" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">slashing $117 off the usual price of Sonos Ace</a>, bringing the cost down to $332.29. That's now significantly less than Sony's WH-1000XM6, Bose's QuietComfort Ultra, and Apple's AirPods Max. It's also only a bit more than you can find the last-gen Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones for at a discount.</p><p>With all this in mind, anyone in the market for a pair of quality over-ear headphones should consider snatching up the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sonos-ace-review">Sonos Ace</a> at just over $300, and I'll tell you why.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="2f72eb08-eef2-4019-99e7-512f93b480ab" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Sonos Ace:  $449.00" data-dimension48="Sonos Ace:  $449.00" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="4uieFX5MgKGvbDAahtBHrG" name="Sonos-Ace-Render-Square" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4uieFX5MgKGvbDAahtBHrG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Sonos Ace: </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Sonos-Ace-Wireless-Noise-Canceling-Headphones-Black/5902797595?" target="_blank" rel="sponsored" data-dimension112="2f72eb08-eef2-4019-99e7-512f93b480ab" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Sonos Ace:  $449.00" data-dimension48="Sonos Ace:  $449.00" data-dimension25=""><del><u>$449.00</u></del><u> </u><u><strong>$332.29 at Walmart</strong></u></a></p><p>Sonos made (sound)waves when it launched the Ace last year, its first pair of over-ear headphones. With a comfort-first design, quality ANC, and excellent sound quality, the Sonos Ace have turned out to be a popular pair of headphones. However, their price left a bit to be desired, and that's why Walmart slashing over $100 off the MSRP is huge. </p><p><strong>Price comparison:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sonos-Ace-Wireless-Headphones-Cancellation/dp/B0CYHGTMNH/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">Amazon - $388.53</a>| <a href="https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/sonos-ace" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">Sonos - $449.00</a><a class="view-deal button" href="" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="2f72eb08-eef2-4019-99e7-512f93b480ab" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Sonos Ace:  $449.00" data-dimension48="Sonos Ace:  $449.00" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you care about stylish design and comfort; you are familiar with Sonos products and have ecosystem hardware already; you want solid sound quality and active noise canceling.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you prefer Apple, Sony, or Bose noise-canceling; you expect Sonos Ace to pair with your Sonos speakers and equipment; you need the lightest pair of over-ears.</p><h2 id="ready-for-the-long-haul-2">Ready for the long haul</h2><p>Sonos Ace are the most comfortable pair of headphones I've ever worn, and you can overlook almost any of the Ace's minor shortcomings because of this. For the earcups and headband, Sonos uses memory foam cushions on the inside and a vegan leather covering on the outside. When you put Sonos Ace on, the cushions will conform to your individual head shape and retain their position for optimal comfort.</p><p>In a practical sense, this means that I can wear the Sonos Ace on a long-haul flight without ever feeling discomfort. That isn't something that I can say about the AirPods Max or the Dyson OnTrac. It also means that the 312-gram weight of the Sonos Ace isn't a problem, despite these headphones being heavier than competing options from Bose and Sony.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="gbEAWBdLUuQBCHyMwk7nPK" name="Sonos-Ace-cups-face-up.jpg" alt="Sonos Ace headphones folded flat and ear cups facing up." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gbEAWBdLUuQBCHyMwk7nPK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In terms of music listening, Sonos fans, be warned — these aren't like your Sonos speakers at home. Sonos Ace only use Wi-Fi connectivity for one thing, and that's connecting to an Arc soundbar and an iOS device <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/sonos-ace-dual-listening-truecinema-beefier-sound-realistic-update">for watching movies and TV shows</a>. For everything else, the Ace will use Bluetooth 5.4.</p><p>Sonos Ace are the only Sonos product that behaves this way, as they usually connect via Wi-Fi, but this is typical for Bluetooth headphones. Still, connectivity and sound quality are excellent, as there are two 40mm drivers right next to your ears that provide a surprisingly full spatial experience. You get dynamic head tracking, spatial audio, and Dolby Atmos support on the Sonos Ace, all of which are optional.</p><p>In terms of raw sound quality, Sonos Ace is all about balance, as you get a nice and even soundstage distribution. You won't hear overpowering bass or miss out on subtle high-end sounds, like cymbals. If you do like a bass-heavy sound, the AirPods Max provide that best, but I tend to like Sonos' balance here.</p><h2 id="the-sonos-ace-is-a-steal-at-more-than-100-off-and-you-shouldn-t-pass-on-it-2">The Sonos Ace is a steal at more than $100 off, and you shouldn't pass on it</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="99856VeUPkeNYDJPT9VRKU" name="Sonos-Ace-both-colors.jpg" alt="Sonos Ace headphones in black and soft white." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/99856VeUPkeNYDJPT9VRKU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I have a collection of over-ear headphones at my disposal, and I use a few of them for different things.

According to their post, this (ideally) cheaper Flip FE will launch alongside Samsung's upcoming flagship duo: the Galaxy Z Flip 7 and the Galaxy Z Fold 7.

It's worth mentioning that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-exynos-2400-comeback">this is a chip from 2023</a>, and was notably slower than Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 3.</p><p>What's more, the Flip 7 FE is supposedly gearing up for a "global" launch, which should place it everywhere the flagship duo will be.</p><h2 id="flipping-the-script-on-fe-2">Flipping the Script on FE?</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">"So 100% it’s confirmed"Galaxy Z Flip FE will launch with Galaxy Z Flip 7 & Galaxy Z Fold 7, and Good News is… "Globally availability"<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1937167897907843373">June 23, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>We've had rumors about a Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE for almost a year now, and they've only continued, with new ones <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-budget-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-fe-tipped-to-feature-a-flagship-caliber-display">speculating on its display</a>. A display expert alleged that Samsung could utilize its screen from the Galaxy Z Flip 6 on the upcoming Flip 7 FE variation. Of course, putting "FE" on a device typically means there will be an area or two with cutbacks. However, it seems that Samsung might not cut back on its display for the FE, giving consumers a flagship experience in that regard.</p><p>In March, renderings of the alleged Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE surfaced, and it pretty much rocked a design <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-z-flip-7-fe-leaked-minty-design-renders-specs-rumors">we've all seen before</a>.

That means your screen grabs will finally keep all the juicy contrast and brightness from what you actually see on your display.</p><p>With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a>, real <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-16-hdr-screenshots-3528355/" target="_blank">HDR screenshots are finally here</a>. Now, when you snap a shot of any HDR content, it doesn’t lose that punch you see in the original image or video.</p><p>Instead of flattening the image, it now saves everything as a PNG packed with all the right metadata, including gain maps. So when you view it on a display that’s HDR-ready, what you see is exactly what was meant to be seen, not some washed-out version.</p><p>Back when most content was SDR, Android didn’t really need HDR screenshot support. But SDR has its limits, such as muted colors and weaker contrast. You’ve probably been there: you snap a shot of a super-detailed photo, only to check the screenshot and it looks flat, dull, maybe even washed out. That’s because standard screenshots default to SDR, which just can’t keep up with all the color and brightness HDR brings to the table.</p><h2 id="hdr-screenshots-are-finally-happening-2">HDR screenshots are (finally!) happening</h2><p>According to leaker Ice Universe, the latest One UI 8 ZYF7 beta—still limited to closed testing—adds support for HDR screenshots (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-is-bringing-hdr-screenshot-support-to-one-ui-8" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>).

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>One of the complaints with a lot of Chromebooks is that you have to either sacrifice performance for the sake of battery life or vice versa. There really hasn't been an option that provides both, but I think the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 is exactly what we've been looking for.</p><p>I was lucky enough to be invited to a briefing for the device launch, alongside a bunch of other creators and executives from both Google and Lenovo. We were told about a lot of new features that are on the way for all Chromebook owners, such as "Select to search with Lens" and "Text Capture."</p><p>It's been rather difficult to be excited about Chromebook hardware over the past eight months or so. There was such a significant gap between device launches earlier this year that I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/where-have-all-the-chromebooks-gone">pondered</a> whether consumer Chromebooks were on their way out the door. However, all of that excitement has come rushing back with the debut of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/lenovo-chromebook-plus-14-advanced-hybrid-ai-powerhouse-launch">Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14</a>.</p><h2 id="power-performance-and-features-2">Power, performance, and features</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="4nGXobJSQyJnSzaSGbXAAo" name="lenovo-chromebook-plus-14-hands-on-8" alt="Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 on a desk connected to a monitor" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4nGXobJSQyJnSzaSGbXAAo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What drives that excitement is a few things. First and foremost, we have the MediaTek Kompanio Ultra 910 at the helm, making this the first Kompanio Ultra-powered Chromebook. As you might suspect, this is an ARM-based processor, which should mean we'll have excellent battery life, with Lenovo claiming the Chromebook Plus 14 will last for up to 17 hours on a single charge.</p><p>That's not completely unheard of in the Chromebook world, but it's impressive considering that the Kompanio Ultra 910 features both a dGPU and NPU. What this amounts to is an on-device Gemini experience that is said to be 32% faster and 44% more efficient. These aren't insignificant improvements; we're looking at the type of boost that was last seen when the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apple-m1-chip-helping-apple-expand-its-brand-lock">Apple M1</a> was introduced.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="j2J7TyN7RUhn9VL5fHMT9o" name="lenovo-chromebook-plus-14-hands-on-mediatek-kompanio-ultra-sticker" alt="MediaTek Kompanio Ultra logo on Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/j2J7TyN7RUhn9VL5fHMT9o.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When the various demos were being performed, the Chromebook Plus 14 didn't break a sweat. And the thing that I kept reminding myself of is that more and more of these features are being handled on-device, as opposed to being offloaded to the cloud. I'm excited about the prospect of having access to more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> features, even if I'm not connected to the internet.</p><p>Unique to the Chromebook Plus 14 are "Smart grouping" and "Image editing in the Gallery app." As someone who has at least 20-30 tabs open at any given time, I breathed a sigh of relief during the presentation.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item"

Lenovo definitely nailed it here, as the Chromebook Plus 14 is sleek and lightweight. It screams "premium" from top to bottom, starting with the display.</p><p>We have a 14-inch 2K OLED display that looks fantastic, with great viewing angles and vivid colors. There's even a slight protrusion along the top, where you'll find the admittedly disappointing 5MP webcam. It's serviceable, but definitely leaves a bit to be desired.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="mLLSrJboGDDZoeHCb3RqAo" name="lenovo-chromebook-plus-14-hands-on-2" alt="Close-up on Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 keyboard" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mLLSrJboGDDZoeHCb3RqAo.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="Sj7Jw9dTjqRBegMzy9jf5o" name="lenovo-chromebook-plus-14-hands-on-1" alt="Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 in-hand testing deck flex" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Sj7Jw9dTjqRBegMzy9jf5o.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="jUQimUo3VJq2GetxyAJB3o" name="lenovo-chromebook-plus-14-hands-on-10" alt="Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jUQimUo3VJq2GetxyAJB3o.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Regarding the keyboard, if you've used a Lenovo Chromebook or laptop in the past few years, you'll feel right at home. Oh, and I was happy to see the return of the Quick Insert Key, something that debuted with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review">Galaxy Chromebook Plus</a>, but has yet to be added to other Chromebooks.</p><p>If there's one concern I have here, it's with the trackpad. Apple spoiled me with its Magic Trackpad, and outside of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/hp-dragonfly-pro-chromebook-review">HP Dragonfly Pro</a>, I've yet to find anything that comes close. While it didn't feel like the Chromebook Plus 14 was using a glass trackpad, it also didn't feel very cheap like some of the other options out there. So this is something I'll be paying closer attention to once my review unit arrives.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="3URuo4rCdaEbzDXa4oJ8Ao" name="lenovo-chromebook-plus-14-hands-on-9" alt="Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 close-up on keyboard, trackpad, and fingerprint scanner" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3URuo4rCdaEbzDXa4oJ8Ao.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The last thing I wanted to touch on regarding the design is the bottom casing. While aluminum adorns the lid and keyboard deck, we have plastic on the bottom, and it might look familiar to those who owned a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/pixelbook-go-second-opinion-review">Pixelbook Go</a>.</p><p>Neither Google nor Lenovo explicitly came out and said that it was inspired by the Pixelbook Go, but it's pretty obvious that's the case. Lenovo did share that it opted for this design because it makes it easier to carry around the Chromebook Plus 14 without feeling like it is going to slip out of your hands. No matter the reason, it's kind of cool to see, if not just for adding another layer of uniqueness to this device.</p><h2 id="this-could-be-the-change-chromebooks-needed-2">This could be the "change" Chromebooks needed</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="3qihZzf3Ve962cjz9wYk6o" name="lenovo-chromebook-plus-14-hands-on-6" alt="Generating images using Gemini on Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3qihZzf3Ve962cjz9wYk6o.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Ultimately, I think what makes me so excited about the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 is that this <em>might</em> just be the "Apple M1 moment" we've been waiting for. Lenovo and Google have been working on this specific device for some time, culminating in a Chromebook that is elegant, powerful, and cuts very few corners.</p><p>I already know it's not <em>perfect</em>, as we should definitely have something better than a 5MP webcam. Plus, offering a version with 256GB of storage is a good start, but I do wish there were configurations with more storage. There's a specific reason as to why (<em>cough</em> AI <em>cough</em>), but I'll save those thoughts for later.</p><p>Nevertheless, on the surface, Lenovo and Google checked most, if not all, of the important boxes for a flagship Chromebook Plus device. I'm seriously excited to spend more time with the Chromebook Plus 14 and will report back soon with my final thoughts, once my review unit arrives and I can dig in.</p> ]]></dc:content>

As a bit of house cleaning, the company states the laptop is available with a 14-inch display. The latest Chromebook Plus focuses on professionals, creators, and students, delivering a premium feel throughout the device. Lenovo states this display features a 2K resolution.</p><p>Design-wise, the post highlights the laptop's minimalist design elements, its aluminum chassis, and a backlit keyboard.</p><p>Lenovo touts its Chromebook Plus' touchpad, which should provide a more seamless scrolling approach. On the front of the laptop is a 5MP webcam that also features a physical privacy shutter. Those looking to multitask a little might find the laptop's support for two external displays at 4K resolution useful.</p><h2 id="ai-for-here-and-ai-to-go-2">AI for here and AI to go</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1062px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.50%;"><img id="HXsk4FChWXRzxjZDwpT2MR" name="lenovo-chromebook-plus-overview" alt="The Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14's overview, highlighting its flagship MediaTek chip and loads of AI software." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HXsk4FChWXRzxjZDwpT2MR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1062" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Lenovo)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Lenovo and Google claim this Chromebook Plus is extremely powerful in terms of its AI capabilities. Even Lenovo's executive director and general manager of Chromebooks, Benny Zhang, said, "Whether you are an executive needing AI performance through the day, an artist wishing to create out the studio, or an everday user looking to browse, learn or play, this premium device is your perfect everyday companion."</p><p>What's empowering this laptop is MediaTek's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek/mediatek-kompanio-ultra-next-gen-chromebook-plus-announced">Kompanio Ultra processor</a>, the brand's flagship CPU. This enabled the companies to build <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> directly into the 14-inch Chromebook Plus by Lenovo. With the AI available in the device's shelf, Gemini brings "Select to Search" backed by Lens, so users can find items on their screen without switching tabs/windows. Text Capture comes in as a quick note-taker, grabbing important dates or blurbs from your documents and popping them into Calendar or Docs.</p><p>Moreover, Lenovo states this Chromebook Plus features an upgraded variant of "Help me Read," simplifying heavy, jargon-filled text with the option to ask follow-up questions.</p><p>On Google's side, the company introduced two exclusive features that you'll only find on Lenovo's new Chromebook Plus: Smart Grouping and AI Image Editing. When using the former, the laptop's on-device AI will "intelligently" understand and organize your tabs and documents into like-minded groups. For your images, the AI Image editor enters for the Gallery app, letting users remove backgrounds and turn photos into stickers.</p><h2 id="ready-when-you-are-2">Ready when you are</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:900px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="bg5t3bicYq7xCfxYDmJWEb" name="lenovo-chromebook-plus-14-official-render" alt="The Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bg5t3bicYq7xCfxYDmJWEb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="900" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Lenovo)</span></figcaption></figure><p>According to Lenovo, their latest Chromebook Plus "can be available with Google's Chrome Education upgrade." This lets schools and IT admins manage the ChromeOS and tailor it to their specific needs.</p><p>The laptop has a lot going on under the hood, but portability and longevity are the name of the game, so here's a battery that fits. Lenovo states its laptop is outfitted with a 17-hour battery in a package that weighs roughly 2.6 pounds. More than that, it should remain strong enough to handle multiple tasks, thanks to 16GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage. The device also supports Wi-Fi 7 connectivity.</p><p>The Lenovo Chromebook Plus is available today (June 23), starting at $649 through your expected consumer/commercial channels.</p><ul><li><strong>Laptop deals: </strong><a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-us/category/laptop-deals"><u><strong>Dell</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/promo/laptop-and-computer-deals"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/laptops/1089430"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/d/deals/laptops/?tabkey=Laptop%20Deals"><u><strong>Lenovo</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/slp/weekly-deals/laptops"><u><strong>HP</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.newegg.com/PCs-Laptops/EventSaleStore/ID-1071"><u><strong>Newegg</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Laptops-Todays-Deals-Computers-Tablets/s?rh=n%3A565108%2Cp_n_deal_type%3A23566064011"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

As much as I like RayNeo's products, they require plenty of adjustments to dial in on the fit, and that's thankfully not an issue on the Max 2. The glasses have a plastic chassis that's relatively light at 76g, and the frame has a decent amount of adjustability to it.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="yuYdtbJBWzhTuJpCCEkESn" name="Rokid Max 2 AR Glasses" alt="Rokid Max 2 AR Glasses review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yuYdtbJBWzhTuJpCCEkESn.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5000" height="2816" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4971px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="W7f5H2QJAxer73fLDF5eCn" name="Rokid Max 2 AR Glasses" alt="Rokid Max 2 AR Glasses review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/W7f5H2QJAxer73fLDF5eCn.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4971" height="2800" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Where the design truly shines is the customizability. The Max 2 comes vision adjustment, giving you granular control over the focus of the Micro-OLED panel according to your eyesight. This makes a huge difference in usability, and it ensures the Max 2 delivers a crystal-clear picture at all times.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5115px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="9tTbnwWkAceWB7mEZvPXJn" name="Rokid Max 2 AR Glasses" alt="Rokid Max 2 AR Glasses review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9tTbnwWkAceWB7mEZvPXJn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5115" height="2881" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Honestly, after using these glasses for the better part of a month, I don't see myself going back to AR glasses that don't have this feature. You can use the built-in dials above the rim, and there's no fringing whatsoever once you adjust either lens. The nose bridge has soft pads that are comfortable, and I didn't see any fatigue even after using the Max 2 for well over an hour.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4778px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="Y5JkpCUaxJWJewN7h9h4Mn" name="Rokid Max 2 AR Glasses" alt="Rokid Max 2 AR Glasses review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Y5JkpCUaxJWJewN7h9h4Mn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4778" height="2691" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another positive is the coating on the front shade; it is sufficiently dark that it tunes out ambient light, allowing for a clearer picture. Basically, Rokid nailed all the basics here, and the Max 2 showcase the potential of AR glasses. On that note, there are controls under the right side of the frame, and the USB-C connector is located at the end of the left frame.</p><p>I didn't see any issues connecting the Max 2 to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x200-ultra-review">Vivo X200 Ultra</a>, Pixel 9 Pro Fold, Pixel 9 Pro XL, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a>, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-ipad-pro-m4-13-inch-long-term-review">iPad Pro M4</a>. The Sony Micro-OLED panel is a known quantity in this category, and it delivers good brightness levels and excellent image fidelity.

You get AptX Lossless codecs, and the biggest differentiator is 96kHz/24-bit audio — it's great to see Xiaomi leverage Qualcomm's audio suite.

You'll need to be in the Xiaomi ecosystem to take full advantage of some of the extras, and if you're got the Xiaomi 15 or 15 Ultra, these buds are a no-brainer recommendation.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="3242cd64-16b4-405f-ab67-01263be69e64">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:97.49%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nsVkGVwKmaH8P6GshEfoGG.jpg' alt="Xiaomi Buds 5 Pro"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Xiaomi Buds 5 Pro</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>With great sound and unmatched connectivity, the Buds 5 Pro are among the best earbuds you can get today. </p></p>                </div>                <div class="pro-con"></div>            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

Ask it back then, and it would just point you to another app.</p><p>But according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/06/19/gemini-app-song-search/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, that’s changed. Over the past few weeks, Gemini quietly picked up built-in song search, finally closing a major gap with its predecessor and making it feel more like a fully-loaded assistant for Android users.</p><h2 id="just-ask-and-play-2">Just ask and play</h2><p>To try out Gemini’s new song ID skill, just say, “What song is this?” It’ll then launch a full-screen mode and ask you to play, sing, or hum the tune. While it listens, you’ll see that signature pulsing sphere in action as it hunts down the closest match using Google’s smarts.</p><p>Gemini’s music-matching skills work across the board, meaning it can catch songs playing nearby, in your playlists, or even ones you hum.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:383px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.54%;"><img id="cDwTGfCjCkhBQqv5m5FbKi" name="Gemini-app-song-search" alt="song search feature in the Gemini app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cDwTGfCjCkhBQqv5m5FbKi.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="383" height="860" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:383px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.54%;"><img id="iWkGF5cojPYZznXhM83aKi" name="Gemini-app-song-search" alt="song search feature in the Gemini app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iWkGF5cojPYZznXhM83aKi.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="383" height="860" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><h2 id="still-a-bit-clunky-2">Still a bit clunky</h2><p>While Gemini on Android can now ID songs, it’s not fully baked into the Gemini experience just yet. When you ask it to name a tune, it actually hands things off to the Google app’s full-screen listening mode.</p><p>It works, but it’s not as smooth or seamless as something like Pixel’s built-in Now Playing feature, which still takes the lead when it comes to smooth song ID. You can trigger it with a quick voice command or tap the lock screen shortcut, and it delivers results right in the interface. Plus, it works offline, which is a major win.</p><p>Another thing that sets Gemini’s song ID apart from a fully integrated setup is that it shows the results on a Google Search page instead of keeping it in the chat. So instead of a smooth, in-line answer like you’d get from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a>, you’re bumped out of the conversation flow, making the experience feel a bit disjointed.</p><p>Currently, Song Search is only live in Gemini on Android. Google hasn’t officially said when (or if) it’s coming to iOS, but chances are it’s just a phased rollout.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It's a journey that's taken me five years to get to, and while I've slowly climbed the ranks among my fellow Spartans over the years, I still have a <em>long</em> way to go before I ever consider the possibility of making the podium.</p><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Sunday Runday</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rV2GgqHS9nqccNipGMkWqB" name="lloyd-break-dancing.jpg" caption="" alt="Lloyd, the Android Central mascot, break-dancing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rV2GgqHS9nqccNipGMkWqB.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text">Sunday Runday is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/sunday-runday">weekly column</a> that talks about the world of wearables, apps, and fitness tech related to running and health. Normally written by Android Central Wearables Editor Michael Hicks, this week is a guest post by Android Central Senior Editor Nicholas Sutrich, who has been on a fitness journey since 2020 when he tried CrossFit for the first time.</p></div></div><p>Regardless if I ever podium, though, the key to improvement is through training. Quantifying my results with a smartwatch is extraordinarily helpful, but with the variety of obstacles and types of fitness found throughout a Spartan race, which watch is the best way to track things?</p><p>I turned to two of my favorites from last year, the OnePlus Watch 3 and Google Pixel Watch 3, both of which I've regularly turned to because of their fitness-tracking accuracy and detailed stats. And while I prefer the smaller size of the 41mm Pixel Watch 3, the battery life of the OnePlus Watch 3 is an even better plus.</p><p>After I finished the race, I compared my stats using a combination of tools. Strava pulled the data off my OnePlus Watch 3, while Google's Fitbit does all the work for the Pixel. All of those were dumped into a web-based tool called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://quantified-self.io">Quantified Self</a>, which makes it easy to directly compare stats and GPS-tracked maps at a glance. Now, for the results.</p><h2 id="let-s-get-spartan-2">Let's get Spartan</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7yWScscKFK2EGWfJYJJnUb" name="oneplus-watch-3-google-pixel-watch-3-spartan-race-map" alt="A GPS-generated map of a Spartan Race comparing the OnePlus Watch 3 and Google Pixel 3's GPS tracking accuracy" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7yWScscKFK2EGWfJYJJnUb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you've never attended a Spartan Race before, here's the gist. Spartan Races come in three lengths: Sprint (5K, 20+ obstacles), Super (10K, 25+ obstacles), Beast (21K, 30+ obstacles), and Ultra (50K, 60+ obstacles). Obstacles are a variety of challenges that include anything from rope climbs to crawling under barbed wire, angled walls that you have to run or climb over, and even carrying heavy objects for a set length.</p><p>To date, I've only run Sprints and have no intention of running longer. I'm not Michael Hicks, and I can't run <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/what-i-learned-running-20-mile-race-wearing-four-watches" target="_blank">20-mile races</a>, but I have participated in Ninja Warrior competitions in the past, so obstacles are my strong suit. The varied nature of a Spartan Race makes it tough to measure with a watch that's built for running, but they still provide a good measure of data to work with for comparison.</p><p>Normally, I run Spartan Races in my home state of North Carolina, where things are a lot hillier, but I decided to try one while on vacation in the much flatter (and hotter) state of Florida.</p><div ><table><caption>Post-run 20-miler stats from four fitness watches</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>OnePlus Watch 3</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel Watch 3</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Distance</strong></p></td><td  ><p>5.26 Km</p></td><td  ><p>5.33 Km</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Pace</strong></p></td><td  ><p>11:37 min/km</p></td><td  ><p>11:05 min/km</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Ascent / Decent</strong></p></td><td  ><p>0 m / 0 m</p></td><td  ><p>35 m / 50 m</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Avg. / max heart rate</strong></p></td><td  ><p>177 bpm / 195 bpm</p></td><td  ><p>177 bpm / 200 bpm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Running power average / max</strong></p></td><td  ><p>93 W / 532 W</p></td><td  ><p>N/A</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Calories</strong></p></td><td  ><p>852 kcal</p></td><td  ><p>864 kcal</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Steps</strong></p></td><td  ><p>7,049</p></td><td  ><p>7,042</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Cadence</strong></p></td><td  ><p>117 spm</p></td><td  ><p>112 spm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Stride length</strong></p></td><td  ><p>0.74m</p></td><td  ><p>0.74m</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Vertical oscillation</strong></p></td><td  ><p>7.7cm</p></td><td  ><p>8.1cm</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>While both watches are pretty even keel across the board, a few stats stood out to me. First off is the elevation change, where the OnePlus Watch 3 seemed to think Florida is a lot flatter than it actually is.</p><p>While the majority of the circuit through Burt Aaronson South County Regional Park in Boca Raton is extraordinarily flat by my North Carolinian standards, several obstacles were above or below the elevation of most of the rest of the course.</p><p>The bucket carry, for instance, had me trek up a man-made hill that was a few dozen feet high, while another obstacle had us wading through a pond that we had to navigate down a hill to reach.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3062px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:49.12%;"><img id="yiLsHsMLGD4Nj8PvptJRjW" name="oneplus-watch-3-google-pixel-watch-3-spartan-race-altitude" alt="Altitude measurements during a Spartan race while wearing a OnePlus Watch 3 and a Google Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yiLsHsMLGD4Nj8PvptJRjW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3062" height="1504" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Looking at the graph, it's clear something malfunctioned on the OnePlus Watch 3. Whether this was a bug or something else, I'm not sure, but I know that I didn't get accurate altitude information from the OnePlus Watch 3. I've never seen it do this outside of this one race (of course), and I've taken it hiking several times.</p><p>I know this was a fluke though, because when I look at the rest of the data, both watches are impressively neck-and-neck. This is impressive to me because it confirms my thoughts in my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-hands-on">OnePlus Watch 3 initial impressions</a> where I said that OnePlus fixed all the issues I had with the OnePlus Watch 2, namely giving it accurate fitness tracking capabilities.</p><p>OnePlus outfitted the OnePlus Watch 3 with a more precise dual-frequency GPS, and it shows when you zoom into the map. In the map below, the OnePlus Watch 3 is <strong>orange</strong>, while the Pixel Watch 3 is <strong>blue</strong>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:985px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:46.29%;"><img id="utcBdHXhpV6apZLkGDksHb" name="oneplus-watch-3-google-pixel-watch-3-spartan-race-map-01" alt="A GPS-generated map of a Spartan Race comparing the OnePlus Watch 3 and Google Pixel 3's GPS tracking accuracy" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/utcBdHXhpV6apZLkGDksHb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="985" height="456" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I know from running the course that I wasn't running around as erratically as the Pixel Watch 3 suggests. For instance, I know I didn't run under the trees on the right side of the image. I stuck to the path as the OnePlus Watch 3's track shows.</p><p>Likewise, the strange loop you see on the left side from the Pixel Watch 3 didn't happen like it shows. That was a 20-foot rope wall that I had to scale, then flip around and make my way back down. The OnePlus Watch 3 has a similar circular motion to the path, but it's much more inline with my actual movements.</p><h2 id="which-is-best-2">Which is best?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="gTkpyfbJXQDEEZgpK7BhoC" name="oneplus-watch-3-vs-google-pixel-watch-3" alt="Wearing a OnePlus Watch 3 and a Google Pixel Watch 3 on separate arms to compare them" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gTkpyfbJXQDEEZgpK7BhoC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Looking at the rest of the bevy of available stats — it's seriously overwhelming if you don't know what these mean — it's clear both watches are close enough to each other in tracking to call this a tie. Even the heart rate was dead on, showing a 177 bpm average for the duration of the hour-long race.</p><p>For me, the choice between the two can be broken down into two main points. Want a smaller smartwatch that's extra comfortable to wear? The Google Pixel Watch 3 is the best choice for that right now, but a smaller OnePlus Watch 3 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-expands-its-mid-tier-lineup">is on the way</a> that will surely challenge it.</p><p>If you want a watch with excellent fitness-tracking capabilities and a battery that'll last you an average of 4 days on a single charge — yes, even with regular fitness and GPS tracking — the OnePlus Watch 3 is a no-brainer. This is OnePlus's best year yet, and it's great to see the company improving its products in meaningful ways that mean you won't have to sacrifice something when choosing them.

Smaller sensors and lower resolutions sometimes can result in noisier images that just don't look as good.</p><p>Flip phones still have front-facing cameras on the display, but to be honest, I rarely ever use them, and if I do, it's to hop on a video call. But if I ever want to take a selfie, I close the phone and turn on the camera. This way, not only can I view myself using the cover screen, but it lets me take selfies with the superior quality of the primary camera.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="PDzsWCXuPt3JBd5F7Lm5dj" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-camera-sample-9.jpg" alt="Taking a selfie in front of a ferris wheel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PDzsWCXuPt3JBd5F7Lm5dj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="3072" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What's great is that you don't need an expensive flip phone to make it happen; even the cheaper ones with smaller cover screens normally provide a selfie preview.

Once it's done, it'll stitch them into a fun 4x4 collage.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-capturing-your-best-angles"><span>Capturing your best angles</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kmxA8vznEPkq9pPkTqSiFo" name="motorola-razr-plus-2024-closed-camera-viewfinder-01" alt="Taking a picture of me taking a picture of the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 with its cover screen camera viewfinder active" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kmxA8vznEPkq9pPkTqSiFo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of the worst things is to have your picture taken by someone else, only for it to come out badly or show you at an awkward angle. You're pretty much at the mercy of whoever is capturing the photo, and you just have to hope that at least one of the voters that they're taking comes out good enough to post on Instagram.</p><p>With most flip phones, this becomes a thing of the past. With their expansive cover screens, phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Motorola Razr</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip</a> allow you to turn on a preview of the viewfinder. That way, when you're taking a photo of someone, they can see themselves and angle themselves appropriately, ensuring that you're capturing their best side.</p><p>I use this anytime I take photos of friends, and they always comment on how cool and useful it is that they can see themselves.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-this-one-s-for-the-tiktokers"><span>This one's for the TikTokers</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="cd5KaAGAXKDYu4ARsYcVQc" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-auto-zoom-selfie-01.jpg" alt="The Auto Zoom on the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cd5KaAGAXKDYu4ARsYcVQc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you're a TikToker or content creator, this one's for you. Instead of buying a tripod or another accessory to prop your phone up while recording a video, you can just take a flip phone, set it down somewhere, and fold it at an angle. With the cover screen viewfinder, you'll be able to see yourself while you record your videos. And again, since you're not using the front camera, the quality should be much better than with a traditional smartphone.</p><p>This is one of my favorite ways to take hands-free "selfies" that don't look like selfies and appear to have been taken by someone else. This works great when paired with Air Gestures, which activate a short countdown when you hold your hand up at the camera. And for video, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-camera-review">Razr Ultra</a> also lets you control videos in a similar fashion, letting you start, pause, or end video recording by showing your palm or fist.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MgWpePvVCJjkwATPLpDGXf" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2025-paddleboard" alt="The Motorola Razr Plus 2025 on a paddleboard" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MgWpePvVCJjkwATPLpDGXf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>However, it can also be a great way to capture footage of not just yourself, but also of other things.

There’s quite a bit that might entice you to upgrade or buy the newest option, but some features that might convince you to stick with what you have or save with an older model, at least for now.

The device sports a 6.7-inch pOLED Super HD HDR10+ screen with 2,712 x 1,220 resolution, 120Hz refresh rate, and up to 4,500 nits brightness.</p><p>The screen is also Pantone SkinTone validated to ensure accurate color reproduction. Although Nicholas Sutrich notes in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-edge-2025-review" target="_blank">his review of the Motorola Edge 2025</a> that the screen exhibits mura issues and employs color dithering to simulate deeper colors than the panel can actually produce. He finds the supposed higher resolution not worth the trade-off in refresh rate, which is actually higher in the Motorola Edge 2024.</p><p>Finished in soft-touch vegan leather with a slight curve to its design that Sutrich calls “gorgeous,” the phone comes in just one color, Forest Green, which Sutrich describes as “stunning.” The screen is further protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 7, along with an anti-fingerprint coating.</p><p>It’s ultra-durable, sporting both an IP68 and IP69 rating for resistance against dust and water. It also meets MIL-STD-810H standards for protection against things like drops, falls, and bumps.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="mUXSsTuSWSJfLmTeTcumcN" name="Motorola-Edge-2025-back-03" alt="The vegan leather back of the forest green Motorola Edge 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mUXSsTuSWSJfLmTeTcumcN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You only get a single storage option of 256GB along with a 5,200mAh battery, which Motorola says can last for up to two days. If you charge it for just six minutes, you can get up to a full extra day, great for those in a rush who need a quick power boost before walking out the door. The phone supports 68W TurboPower charging (with an optional adapter) and 15W TurboPower wireless charging.</p><p>Equipped with dual speakers that support Dolby Atmos, it has two mics as well. You get only two OS upgrades, and Motorola does not indicate how long the phone will receive security updates. That’s shorter than Motorola’s usual offering of three years of OS updates, a strange change for this device that would only take you into Android 18. It has both fingerprint and face unlock.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4KWxAgEZrjUT7rEfeUNtHU" name="motorola-edge-2024-display-home-pink.jpg" alt="The homescreen of the Motorola Edge (2024)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4KWxAgEZrjUT7rEfeUNtHU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>By comparison, the Motorola Edge 2024, introduced in June 2024, features a slightly smaller 6.6-inch AMOLED FHD+ screen with a resolution of 2,400 x 1080 and a lower peak brightness of 1,300 nits.

That’s something to consider if you decide to purchase this phone, or if you’re currently using it and considering an upgrade.</p><p>It has a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-7s-gen-2-launch">Snapdragon 7s Gen 2</a> processor and the same 8GB RAM with RAM Boost, but Sutrich calls the processor slow, likening it to ancient phones like the LG V60. However, he says it is efficient, doesn’t drain the battery quickly while in use, and is suitable for playing modern games like Genshin Impact without performance issues. But you won’t be able to run higher detail settings, resolutions, or framerates.</p><p>Like the Motorola Edge 2025, the Motorola Edge 2024 supports <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/motorola-smart-connect-meta-quest-3">Smart Connect</a> as well, a great feature for multitaskers. “There’s something magical about controlling your smartphone with the same keyboard and mouse that simultaneously controls your PC,” enthuses Sutrich.</p><h2 id="motorola-edge-2025-vs-edge-2024-taking-photos-2">Motorola Edge 2025 vs. Edge 2024: Taking photos</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wA5y2ow7qmts2XPvdcgqiT" name="Motorola-Edge-2025-camera-01" alt="Taking a macro shot of red flowers with the Motorola Edge 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wA5y2ow7qmts2XPvdcgqiT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When it comes to the cameras, the Motorola Edge 2025 and Motorola Edge 2024 differ significantly. While Sutrich points out that a weak point of the Motorola Edge 2024 was its cameras, he says the issues have been fixed with the Motorola Edge 2025 thanks to not only upgrades to ultrawide and selfie cameras, but also the addition of a telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom.</p><p>The Motorola Edge 2025 has a pro-grade camera system with four cameras, including a 50MP main with wide-angle with Macro Vision, a 50MP rear, a 10MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom and up to 30x Super Zoom, and a 50MP front camera with autofocus, ideal for taking fantastic selfies and group shots.

If you just want to take basic photos for sharing in messages or on social media, it will suffice. But he adds that even launching the camera is slow and feels clunky, with lag between when you try to launch the camera and it’s ready to use. Even photo capture itself is slow with odd shutter lag.</p><p>You won’t be able to take great motion capture pictures either, so if you have kids or pets, forget about this device.

Between the Motorola Edge 2025 vs Edge 2024, which should you choose? Whether you already have the Motorola Edge 2024 or you’re looking to buy new, your best bet is to buy or upgrade to the Motorola Edge 2025. The Motorola Edge 2024 is only supported through this latest OS. So, once Google launches Android 17, you won’t be able to update to it. This means you still have some time, so you can mull it over through the next 12 months if you’re on a tight budget and still unsure.</p><p>What upgrades do you get with the Motorola Edge 2025? To summarize, it features a slightly larger and higher-resolution screen with significantly higher peak brightness. It features an additional camera and improved overall camera capabilities. It has a bigger and purportedly longer-lasting battery. It’s also more durable, with stronger Gorilla Glass on the screen and a higher IP rating. Plus, let’s not forget all the premium AI features that come with this phone.</p><p>The Motorola Edge 2024 boasts a stunning design, a faster refresh rate than the Motorola Edge 2025, and a Snapdragon processor versus a MediaTek processor, although, based on Sutrich’s review, this isn’t necessarily a significant advantage. It’s still pretty rugged, has the same amount of RAM and storage, decent battery life with charging at the same rate, and access to limited AI features through Google Photos. But the cameras are a massive step down, and performance is limited.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="yt2wVsDKRDW64hLbwPmVm" name="motorola-edge-2024-back-03.jpg" alt="The gorgeous vegan leather back of the Motorola Edge (2024)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yt2wVsDKRDW64hLbwPmVm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Thus, the Motorola Edge 2025 is a step up that’s worth taking. With that said, if you’re upgrading, you might be better off looking for an even bigger and better step up. Consider <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">the best Android phones</a> you can buy right now, and potentially even a different brand. For a tighter budget, look at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">the best cheap Android phones</a>. Some of the top phones in a similar price range to the Motorola Edge 2025 are the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">Google Pixel 9a</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a>, both of which outperform this device. You might end up being happier with either of these phones.</p><p>If you are adamant about sticking with Motorola, however, consider <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones">the best Motorola phones</a> for additional alternatives. Interestingly, with this brand, you’ll probably get the best bang for your buck with a foldable phone. Among <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">the best foldable phones</a>, Motorola has some high-performing options that make the list, and are a fraction of the cost of competitors.</p><p>Otherwise, if you’re only considering these two devices, either to buy new or upgrade, go with the Motorola Edge 2025. It brings you into the world of AI, bumps up specs with cameras that are miles ahead, and it’s offered at a decent price.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="abece3cd-47bd-49b8-b213-2296120f6636">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LBMcwTEvmFhbHXUbog2FBX.jpg' alt="Motorola Edge 2025"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Motorola Edge 2025</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Not the best Motorola phone you can buy</strong></em></p><p>The Motorola Edge 2025 is better than the Motorola Edge 2024, but it's still not the best Motorola phone, or affordable Android phone for that matter, that you can buy.

They sound much better than I imagined, the connectivity is rock-solid, and they have the best isolation of any product I've used yet. If you're in the Apple ecosystem and want an audio upgrade, this is definitely the way to go.</p><p>I use my AirPods Max with plenty of Android phones too, and they hold up just as well as the Bose QC Ultra or Sony WH-1000XM5. The USB-C model is highly convenient to use as it charges using the same cable as all of my other gear, and a new software update unlocks high-res audio, making the headset that much more versatile. The AirPods Max usually retail for $549, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/AirPods-Max-Blue/11347872631">they're down to $479 right now</a>, putting them on the same footing as Sony's new WH-1000XM6.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="48d91744-6857-4a5b-b040-a89989cc86db" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="The AirPods Max combine an elegant design with amazing sound, and they have excellent noise isolation.

The aluminum chassis is heavier than the plastic-clad Bose and Sony headsets, but it gives the Max better durability, and I didn't see any issues with reliability even after a year of extensive use.</p><p>While it doesn't look like it, the design has much better comfort than I imagined. The memory foam ear pads do a good job even with extended use, and the knit headband is highly breathable. I also like that you get the Max in unique color options — that's just not the case with most headsets in this category.</p><p>What makes the AirPods Max stand out is the sound quality; they have a powerful low-end combined with clean mids and an airy treble, and they do a fantastic job with a diverse set of genres. Also great is the spatial audio mode; there's a noticeable difference to the sound, and the increased soundstage makes music that much more immersive.</p><p>The noise isolation is unmatched; the AirPods Max do an incredible job tuning out ambient noises in the vicinity, and they're much more effective than Sony — something I didn't think was possible. I had no problems using the headset on a 10-hour flight, and battery life is equivalent to Bose and Sony rivals.</p><p>Basically, the AirPods Max are among the best headsets available today, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/AirPods-Max-Blue/11347872631">discount to $479</a> makes them that much more accessible.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Combined with the node shift to 3nm, the 8 Elite delivered massive gains across the board, and it continues to be one of the fastest mobile platforms available today.</p><p>Qualcomm isn't sitting idly by either — the chip vendor is pushing up the launch of this year's flagship, the Snapdragon 8 Elite 2. That is a big deal in itself, as it allows device makers to launch phones and tablets based on the chipset sooner than ever before. This is what we know about the Snapdragon 8 Elite 2, and when it will make its debut.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-2-cpu"><span>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite 2: CPU</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bScw4JoPDKnTFhQdgfAWGB" name="Snapdrag-8-elite" alt="Shot of the stage from Unpacked 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bScw4JoPDKnTFhQdgfAWGB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Qualcomm went back to using custom cores with the Snapdragon 8 Elite, and the 8 Elite 2 is set to build on this foundation. It will use a similar design that should see two performance cores alongside six mid-size cores, and it is also likely to be fabricated on the 3nm node.</p><p>What's interesting is that a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5176636804695617">leak out of China</a> details the Snapdragon 8 Elite 2's Geekbench scores, and with a single-core score of over 4,000 and multi-core going over 11,000, it has a significant boost over the 8 Elite. To put that into context, the maximum I got in Geekbench with the Snapdragon 8 Elite is 3,190 in single-core and 9,957 in multi-core results.</p><p>Essentially, Qualcomm is targeting an increase of up to 30% in single-core workloads, and up to 12% in multi-core scenarios. That's a huge deal considering the sheer performance differential between the Snapdragon 8 Elite and 8 Gen 3, and it's exciting to see the chip vendor able to deliver these kind of gains for the second year in a row.</p><p>Of course, these details are based on a leak, so we will need to wait and see how the Snapdragon 8 Elite 2 holds up in real-world testing.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-2-gaming"><span>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite 2: Gaming</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2610px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rRUXiFcY6iXrsZAHShZKPR" name="Snapdragon-8-Elite-Gaming" alt="A photo showing a gaming phone with the Snapdragon 8 Elite logo hovering above it" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rRUXiFcY6iXrsZAHShZKPR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2610" height="1468" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Snapdragon 8 Elite is a gaming powerhouse, and it has a significantly higher overhead when it comes to playing demanding titles. I didn't see any issues getting stable framerates even with all the settings turned up, and if anything, the gaming ecosystem on Android is the bottleneck — we need console-quality titles like iOS.</p><p>While we don't know what changes Qualcomm is making to Adreno this year, the one thing I'd like to see is better thermal thresholds. The Snapdragon 8 Elite tends to run hotter than earlier versions, and that means resultant devices overheat even with sizeable thermal management solutions. Qualcomm needs to do a better job setting thermal boundaries on the 8 Elite 2 to ensure this isn't an issue on 2026 flagships.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-2-launch-date"><span>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite 2: Launch date</span></h3><p>Qualcomm has confirmed that it is accelerating the launch window of the Snapdragon 8 Elite 2. The chipset will be showcased at the chip vendor's annual Snapdragon Summit, being held on September 23. Qualcomm usually holds its launch event sometime in Q4, with the initial wave of devices featuring its latest chipset debuting in Q1.</p><p>Clearly, it wants to change that dynamic, and by launching the Snapdragon 8 Elite 2 early, it will be able to position it better alongside the upcoming A19 — which will also be announced at a similar time.</p><hr><p>While there's plenty we don't know about the Snapdragon 8 Elite 2 — including changes to the camera and connectivity — we should get those details over the coming weeks, and I'll update this post accordingly.</p> ]]></dc:content>
