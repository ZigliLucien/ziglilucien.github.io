Both screens improve the screen-to-body ratio over the last-gen, resulting in more usable screen real estate. Naturally, you'll want to invest in some of the best <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> screen protectors to protect the integrity of these upgraded displays.</p><p>Plastic films are used for the internal folding screen, as glass cracks when folded, whereas the outer Flex Window, as it is called by Samsung, can utilize standard tempered glass protectors. If you prefer a thinner layer, you could opt for a plastic film on the outer display as well.

You don't need to spend more than $20 to get the highest quality screen protection for your foldable's internal and external displays.</p><p>There are a few names that keep popping up time and time again when it comes to screen protector brands. IMBZBK and Milomdoi in particular always deliver, both in terms of quality and value. The three-pack from IMBZBK is the most comprehensive kit available for the Galaxy Z Flip 7. Getting three sets of three items along with two frames for under $20 is a magnificent bargain. Both easy-install frames enable perfect at-home installation. The lens protectors are an added bonus.</p><p>If you're not comfortable replacing the internal screen protector off of the folding screen, you don't need to step out of your comfort zone. Simply get a cover display protector alone, which will be more cost-effective too. Spigen's upgraded GlastR EZ Fit Pro for the Galaxy Z Flip 7 is a good option. It comes with a frame that also acts as a dust-removing tool, simplifying the installation process. This kit includes two pieces for about $17, but if you want a cheaper alternative, consider the three-pack from Mr.Shield that only costs $7. There's no assistive frame or tool included, however, so take that into consideration before going forward with your purchase.</p><p>After grabbing a solid screen protection kit, be sure to check out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/best-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-cases">best Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 cases</a> for advanced impact absorption.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Despite the naming scheme, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic doesn't really come in a dark color like black, charcoal, or graphite. If that's a deal breaker, perhaps you'll be happier with the regular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8 in Graphite</a> instead — sans rotating bezel, though.</p><p>Don't knock the Black variant of the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic until you've seen it up close and personal. I know many people only buy black tech. In fact, my husband is one such individual. However, variety is the spice of life. So spice things up with this silver-and-black combo for once! It looks really cool and matches well with various styles and materials of watch bands.</p><p>If the non-monochrome look bothers you, then the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic in White will fit your tastes. This option is silver throughout and comes with a bright white band.</p><p>I do have a bone to pick with Samsung over the limited case colors. My favorite hue for wearables is usually gold, rose gold, or champagne gold. This is because it's much easier to match such shades with accessories and jewelry. It's a missed opportunity on Samsung's part to skip a warmer colorway for the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic.</p><p>We're stuck with these options for this generation, so there's not much to do but complain. Hopefully, Samsung will heed our grievances with its next smartwatch lineup. If not, then people like me will probably stick with the Google Pixel Watch.</p> ]]></dc:content>

However, if you were hoping to waltz into a Verizon, AT&T, or T-Mobile store and add it to your existing plan with convenient financing, you're out of luck.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/you-cant-buy-galaxy-z-flip-7-fe-from-carriers-in-the-united-states/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>, the big three <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-carrier-us">U.S. carriers</a> have collectively decided to give the Z Flip 7 FE a wide berth.</p><p>Right now, your choices are slim. You can grab the unlocked model straight from Samsung’s online store or try your luck at places like Best Buy or Amazon. Either way, you're looking at paying full price or hopping on Samsung’s payment plan, neither of which quite hits like those sweet carrier promos.</p><h2 id="some-underdogs-step-up-2">Some underdogs step up</h2><p>Now, before you completely despair, there are a couple of small-time players who are actually offering the device. Boost Mobile and Xfinity Mobile are apparently offering the Z Flip 7 FE for free with certain postpaid plans, as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/z-flip-7-fe-carrier-3576231/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>.</p><p>So, if you've been looking for an excuse to switch carriers, Samsung might have just given you one, albeit for a phone that the big players are apparently side-eyeing.</p><p>It’s not like Samsung didn’t try to give the FE some shine. It comes with all the expected trimmings of the Flip series, minus a few high-end frills to keep the price down. That makes it a sweet deal for anyone curious about foldables but not ready to drop flagship cash.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="5awGSbNEyscXZbVmtjpnA4" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-fe-hands-on-3" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5awGSbNEyscXZbVmtjpnA4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1407" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="why-the-cold-shoulder-2">Why the cold shoulder?</h2><p>There’s no official explanation yet, which just fuels the confusion. Maybe Samsung didn’t want to cannibalize its flagship foldables. Maybe carriers weren’t thrilled with the specs-to-price ratio. Or maybe the logistics didn’t pan out in time for launch.</p><p>Whatever the reason, it’s clear that if you want the Z Flip 7 FE in the U.S., you’ll need to skip the carrier stores and go straight to the source.</p><p>On the bright side, unlocked buyers won’t have to deal with bloatware or the usual maze of carrier-specific delays when it comes to updates.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="3219eac3-88d6-43d9-9891-128ad440b605">            <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/the-next-galaxy/reserve/" data-model-name="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SnVAEkbBa3ziMj85fokzMb.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 is definitely a step-up from its predecessor, especially if you've been eyeing the competition with a bit of envy.

The 516 GE features a gorgeous 16-inch display with a 2560x1600 resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate.</p><p>Powered by the Intel Core 5 120U, this chip is paired with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of onboard storage.

It's not that 8GB isn't enough for your day-to-day tasks, it's that we're seeing more and more AI features coming to Chromebooks.</p><p>And as those features are moved to being performed on-device, the extra RAM would be a big help in providing a smooth experience. Plus, since this is a Chromebook Plus model, you'll get 12 months of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google AI Pro</a> for free. That gives you access to the latest Gemini features, along with 2TB of cloud storage.</p><p>Nevertheless, this is the kind of Chromebook that is good for practically everyone, even if you aren't a fan of the RGB backlighting. Ultimately, you can just make adjustments or turn it off from the Settings app after it lands on your doorstep.</p><h2 id="prime-day-2025-android-deals-quick-links-2">Prime Day 2025 Android deals — quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-2399640095952979730-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>Prime Day is LIVE July 8-11: see the full list of Amazon deals</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phones: </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Fref_%3Dnav_cs_gb%26bubble-id%3Dcell-phones-accessories%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-8227143803950300941-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">major discounts on Samsung and Pixel</a></li><li><strong>Tablets: </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dtablets%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-4918385691477463048-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">discounted Galaxy Tab and iPad</a></li><li><strong>Wearables: </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dsmartwatches%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-4130069407617560132-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">up to 45% off Garmin watches</a></li><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Famazonprime%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1479270651470444954-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>Most Prime Day deals are members-only: sign up for the 30-day trial</strong></a></li></ul><ul><li><em>For more on Prime Day 2025, check out </em><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><em><strong>our ultimate shopping guide</strong></em></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

One of Google's reported early Pixel 10 models supposedly appeared on an unexpected website overseas.</p><p>A post by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/07/08/one-of-googles-pixel-10-prototypes-just-leaked-on-a-chinese-auction-site/">9to5Google</a> highlights the apparent appearance of a Pixel 10 prototype model on a Chinese <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.goofish.com/item?spm=a21ybx.item.itemCnxh.26.301a3da6AshFjk&id=934114703133&categoryId=0">auction website</a>. The machine-translated description box says the seller is offering the motherboard of the phone in question, which looks similar to what we've seen in past leaks. The alleged Pixel 10 still sports those rounded corners and flat edges, just like Google's past-gen.</p><p>The back, which furthers its prototype nature, displays the "G" logo and a horizontal camera bump with an extra lens. The photo of the motherboard features a bolded "G5," which likely indicates the phone's expected <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-has-reportedly-finished-designing-the-pixel-10s-custom-tensor-g5-soc">Tensor G5</a> SoC.</p><p>There appear to be three lenses inside the Pixel 10's camera island and its LED flash. The Chinese seller states this device is in its EVT stage, which the publication notes indicates the "final stage" before mass production for the market. However, 9to5 picked up on an oddity, which is the phone's fastboot mode screen that displays DVT (Design Validation Test) instead of the seller's alleged EVT stage.</p><h2 id="an-earlier-pixel-10-2">An Earlier Pixel 10?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:781px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:74.90%;"><img id="PKKNwurqhWzQgVeAp8GWvL" name="google-pixel-10-chinese-auction-site-leak" alt="An alleged Pixel 10 in black on sale on a Chinese auction website." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PKKNwurqhWzQgVeAp8GWvL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="781" height="585" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: GooFish)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The trail of Pixel 10 leaks about its camera upgrade started in March, when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-series-render-leak-reveal-identical-design">a batch of renders</a> showcased it with three, not two. Aside from the seemingly identical design to the Pixel 9, there was speculation that this third lens would bring the base model closer to its Pro and Pro XL siblings. In June, we were met with a report that suggested the Pixel 10 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10s-rumored-telephoto-camera-upgrade-could-make-your-macro-shots-pop">would grab a telephoto lens addition</a>.

Still, we've always called these phones flagship killers, as they feature a really nice balance of affordability and overall performance, and this price point makes the phone even more appealing.

I take a pair of smart glasses on every work trip, and I've been finding myself using RayNeo Air 3S most often because of the comfortable display with 3840Hz PWM dimming and hardware-level blue light blocking.</p><p>Like other smart display glasses, you'll plug the RayNeo Air 3S into basically any computer, console, smartphone, or tablet with a USB-C port and be presented with a giant projected virtual screen that only you can see. This one is a 1080p display, so it looks as crisp as a TV hanging on your wall and helps eliminate neck pain caused by looking down at a laptop or handheld gaming system for too long.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><strong>Prime Day deals and FAQ</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-ca-5457778577287776063-20" target="_blank"><strong>Shop all Amazon Prime Day deals</strong></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="2a269bde-9787-4196-be1e-e338929de117" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Was: $269" data-dimension48="Was: $269" data-dimension25="$" href="https://www.amazon.com/RayNeo-Glasses-HueView-Display-Portable/dp/B0FFSHMQQ4" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1173px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.41%;"><img id="PfQe5DAyAUyKTqGLtwHJCL" name="RayNeo Air 3S" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PfQe5DAyAUyKTqGLtwHJCL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1173" height="779" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>RayNeo Air 3S 😎</strong></p><p><strong>Was: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/RayNeo-Glasses-HueView-Display-Portable/dp/B0FFSHMQQ4" target="_blank" data-dimension112="2a269bde-9787-4196-be1e-e338929de117" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Was: $269" data-dimension48="Was: $269" data-dimension25="$"><del>$269</del></a></p><p><strong>Now:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/RayNeo-Glasses-HueView-Display-Portable/dp/B0FFSHMQQ4" target="_blank"><strong>$225 at Amazon</strong></a><em></em></p><p>"With the Air 3S, RayNeo crafted what may possibly be the best budget XR glasses. The glasses are lighter than their predecessor, and you still get a massive 201-inch micro-OLED panel with vibrant colors and good contrast levels. RayNeo added useful eye protection features, and the glasses connect easily to your phone, tablet, Windows and macOS machine as well as handheld gaming console.

Whether it's around the house or while traveling, these devices can hurt your neck, but a pair of smart glasses like RayNeo Air 3S put the screen right in front of your face, so you can relax and give your neck a break without cutting out any of the fun or productivity.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you're looking for a high-end pair of smart display glasses.

Unlike most smart glasses, these use 3840Hz <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a> to manage brightness, ensuring comfort for the vast majority of people. For reference, your Samsung Galaxy or Google Pixel phone uses 240Hz or 480Hz PWM dimming. The higher that number goes, the more comfortable it is for your eyes long-term.</p><p>These glasses use a classic "birdbath-style" lens to reflect the micro-OLED display in the glasses toward your eyes. Think of them as tiny mirrors hanging just inside the glasses' frame. Because of the way the optics work, your eyes perceive this display as a huge TV projected a few feet away.</p><p>Folks who need prescription glasses can order a custom pair <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://honsvr.com/product/custom-rayneo-air-2s-prescription-lenses-by-honsvr/">through HonsVR for $50</a>. I use these inserts in my smart glasses to ensure I don't have any eye strain, and they're super easy to install since they just clip into the dedicated slot between the nose pads.</p><p>If you're a Nintendo Switch 2 gamer, you should also check out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/i-found-smart-glasses-that-work-perfectly-on-the-nintendo-switch-2-and-all-your-favorite-systems">this Viture Pro Mobile Dock</a> to play your Switch 2 on the go with these OLED glasses.

You can get Viture Pro smart glasses, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/VITURE-Pro-XR-Glasses-Electrochromic/dp/B0D3LRH8G4/"><strong>on sale for $349</strong></a> for Prime Day, which will give you a sharper, brighter display with lenses that can dim themselves when the environment around you gets bright.</p><p>RayNeo Air 3S doesn't offer any kind of light blocking, so they can be sometimes difficult to see if you're using them outside or in a super bright room. If you're just using them in an airport, on a plane, or in our own home, you don't really need this feature. Still, Viture glasses have full support for Viture's extensive system of accessories and add-ons, which is a great reason to pick Viture over other companies.</p><p>Viture also offers myopia adjustment diopter wheels independently for each eye, allowing nearsighted users to adjust for clarity without having to buy a separate set of prescription lenses. That alone cuts $50 off the price if you need glasses, making these a great value so long as your prescription isn't greater than -5.00.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="f484575d-9600-4c28-84f9-efdb9bce293d" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Viture Pro smart glasses: $499" data-dimension48="Viture Pro smart glasses: $499" href="https://www.amazon.com/VITURE-Pro-XR-Glasses-Electrochromic/dp/B0D3LRH8G4/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1152px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="2x4swqbMndsQa27S2EX3ZJ" name="viture-pro-ecosystem-official-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2x4swqbMndsQa27S2EX3ZJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1152" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Viture Pro smart glasses: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/VITURE-Pro-XR-Glasses-Electrochromic/dp/B0D3LRH8G4/" data-dimension112="f484575d-9600-4c28-84f9-efdb9bce293d" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Viture Pro smart glasses: $499" data-dimension48="Viture Pro smart glasses: $499" data-dimension25=""><del>$499</del><strong> $349 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>Viture Pro smart glasses offer an extra-crisp 1080p visuals, 1000 nits of brightness, built-in myopia adjustment diopters up to -5.00, and full support for Viture's extensive range of add-ons and accessories, now on sale for <strong>$150 off </strong>during Prime Day.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/VITURE-Pro-XR-Glasses-Electrochromic/dp/B0D3LRH8G4/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="f484575d-9600-4c28-84f9-efdb9bce293d" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Viture Pro smart glasses: $499" data-dimension48="Viture Pro smart glasses: $499" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p>The king of smart glasses right now are Xreal One, which are on sale for the first time since their launch earlier this year.

But then Baseus came along and showcased what it can do in this category; the PrimeTrip VR2 Max is designed to take things to a whole new level, thanks to 163W of power delivery and four charging ports in total.</p><p>But what I like the most is that the charger comes with two retractable cables. I recently used a UGREEN car charger <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Retractable-Charging-Cigarette-Compatible/dp/B0DSBRM6BD">that has a built-in retractable cable</a> and thought that was cool, but it isn't as good as what Baseus is offering. Oh, and the best part? The VR2 Max is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Baseus-Retractable-Charger-Charging-PrimeTrip/dp/B0F8T4RH9Y">down to just $29 right now</a>, a sizeable 40% discount on its $49 retail price.

The inclusion of two retractable USB-C cables makes all the difference, and if you need a new car charger, you should just get this. </p><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You want a car charger that's designed to deal with cable clutter. Both retractable USB-C cables tuck into the body of the charger when not in use. </p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You don't need as many charging ports. </p><p><strong>Alternative deal: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Retractable-Charging-Cigarette-Compatible/dp/B0DSBRM6BD" data-dimension112="fa5b346f-41e9-4078-996e-0eb50758686a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Alternative deal: UGREEN 90W Retractable Car Charger" data-dimension48="Alternative deal: UGREEN 90W Retractable Car Charger" data-dimension25="$29"><strong>UGREEN 90W Retractable Car Charger </strong></a><strong>— </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Retractable-Charging-Cigarette-Compatible/dp/B0DSBRM6BD"><strong>$27 on Amazon</strong></a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Baseus-Retractable-Charger-Charging-PrimeTrip/dp/B0F8T4RH9Y" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="fa5b346f-41e9-4078-996e-0eb50758686a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Alternative deal: UGREEN 90W Retractable Car Charger" data-dimension48="Alternative deal: UGREEN 90W Retractable Car Charger" data-dimension25="$29">View Deal</a></p></div><p>Look, I can talk about the power budget and go into detail on how the four ports allocate the 163W available, and how the USB-C1 port goes up to 67W. But I don't need to do all that; all you need to know about this car charger is that it has two retractable USB-C cables — each extending to 31.5 inches — and they neatly tuck into the charger when not in use. There's an additional USB-C port alongside USB-A connectivity if two cables aren't enough.</p><p>Oh, and did I mention that the charger swivels? It has 180-degree vertical rotation and 270-degree horizontal rotation, so you can easily route the cables to whichever part of the car you or your passengers are sitting in. I used this charger for the better part of two months now, and it has been nothing short of brilliant.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap"

There's not much to decide here as Samsung only launched two colors this time, and both come in two size options each. Lets take a good look at both shades of the Galaxy Watch 8.</p><h2 id="walk-into-the-light-or-venture-into-the-dark-side-of-the-moon-2">Walk into the light or venture into the dark side of the moon</h2>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_hero" data-id="81dce15f-7c68-4962-bc9a-d14a04b9ac22">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bPLi3GK48NDVrnUA6ydiWi.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 44mm"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 - Graphite</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Darkly demure</strong></em></p><p>The Graphite variant of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 comes in both 40mm and 44mm case options.

Whether you choose the 40mm or 44mm option, it looks good in both. However, Silver isn't as versatile as Graphite when it comes to matching with outfits.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div><ul><li><a href="#main"><strong>Back to the top ^</strong></a></li></ul><h2 id="here-s-how-you-should-choose-the-right-galaxy-watch-8-color-for-yourself-2">Here's how you should choose the right Galaxy Watch 8 color for yourself</h2><p>Settling on one of the two <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-series-launch">Samsung Galaxy Watch 8</a> color variants isn't a tough call to make. You either go for Silver or Graphite, and the watch bands are secondary. Since the bands can always be swapped out to suit the outfit or occasion anyway, don't focus on them when making your choice.</p><p>I highly recommend opting for the colorway that matches the majority of your clothes and accessories. For example, I prefer to wear gold or rose gold accessories, so a Silver Galaxy Watch 8 would clash awfully with most of my jewelry. That's why I'd personally buy the Graphite variant of the Watch 8. I can always swap the straps to a golden metal link one to glam it up or make it look more elegant. Golden doesn't look that bad with black. I'm sure you get the gist.</p><p>So, if your bracelets and clothes lean more towards a silvery aesthetic, you should get the Silver option instead. It's going to be a thousand times easier to style.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Bellini does echo the current Headliner look, but it'll be worth watching if these distinct designs actually make it to shelves.</p><p>These code names aren't new, as they were also mentioned in a May report by The Information, linking them to future Meta eyewear releases.</p><h2 id="smarter-longer-lasting-2">Smarter + longer lasting</h2><p>According to XR Research Institute, both models boast significantly longer battery life compared to the current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray‑Ban Meta glasses</a>. And they could pack smarter AI too, with features like real-time object detection and scene recognition.</p><p>These rumored features line up with what The Information reported earlier—<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-2026-smart-glasses-live-ai-facial-software-report">a “super sensing” mode that could keep Meta AI running for hours</a>, a big leap from the current 30-minute limit.</p><p>Potential new tricks include reminders for forgotten items and facial recognition: imagine being told someone's name as soon as they walk into view.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1038px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:83.53%;"><img id="yzUcNoVNSAkUFimTZTfwnQ" name="Ray-Ban Meta 3" alt="two pairs of rumored Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yzUcNoVNSAkUFimTZTfwnQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1038" height="867" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: XR Research Institute via UploadVR)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:882px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:96.83%;"><img id="jZbkB8ko7pTeLfd644NynQ" name="Ray-Ban Meta 3" alt="two pairs of rumored Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jZbkB8ko7pTeLfd644NynQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="882" height="854" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: XR Research Institute via UploadVR)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Beyond facial recognition, Meta’s AI might soon get even smarter. Picture it reminding you to grab your keys if you forgot, or nudging you about groceries as you head home. The super-sensing mode keeps the cameras and sensors running nonstop so the AI can stay locked in on your day-to-day activities.</p><p>Here’s where timing gets interesting. XR Research Institute thinks these models might arrive before the year’s end. But The Information puts Aperol and Bellini off until 2026.</p><p>Currently, Ray‑Ban Meta glasses come in various frame styles (Wayfarer, Headliner, Skyler), all compatible with clear, sun, polarized, and Transitions lenses. But this rumored pivot to separate optical and sunglass models could signal a bold new direction for the lineup.</p> ]]></dc:content>

They all get equally loud at 80dB, and the piercing sound is great if you need to locate the keys or wallet. There's Qi charging as standard as well, and they all have modern designs that integrate well with the rest of your accessories.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div

scenarios. The only issue with the keychain is that the keyring is on the smaller side, and it isn't possible to hook a finger inside the keyring. I just took out the tracker and put it on another keyring, and that solved the problem.</p><p>Another annoyance is that these trackers are limited to the Find My network, and they don't show up on Google's redesigned Find Hub. So you'll need to have an iPhone to take advantage of the trackers; I would like to see Satechi roll out Android-based versions of these trackers, but that's not on the cards now. If you've got an iPhone and want reliable Qi-enabled trackers, the FindAll collection gets my recommendation.</p><p><em><strong>For everything on Amazon Prime Day, head to our </strong></em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><em><strong>ultimate buying guide</strong></em></u></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></p> ]]></dc:content>

You can also choose between wired and wireless charging options. Wired car chargers are significantly more efficient compared to slower cordless picks, and Anker and UGREEN's options are the best in the biz.</p><p>Both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/anker-car-charger-retractable-cable">Anker Nano 75W Car Charger</a> and UGREEN Nexode Car Charger 90W are on sale for the four-day Amazon Prime Day shopping bonanza. This means you can score super fast charging upgrades for your car on the cheap while the sale lasts. The bonus is that you don't need to worry about buying a cable either, as both car chargers come with retractable USB-C cables.</p><p>I have used both car chargers and found them equally suitable. They both offer a plug-and-play experience. In terms of the built-in cable size, I give Anker the win over UGREEN because it's got a slightly longer 29.4-inch or 75cm cable, whereas the UGREEN cord measures 70cm long. However, UGREEN's option has more ports and can deliver a higher power output.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="121fac69-7019-4048-a631-53c7df55d1b9" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="The Anker Nano 75W Car Charger plugs into your car's cigarette lighter port.

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I used over a dozen ultra short throw (UST) projectors over the years, and AWOL Vision's LTV-3000 Pro has the distinction of being one of the best. The projector is straightforward to set up and use, and you don't need to mount it on the ceiling or the other side of the room; as it uses UST tech, you can position it just a few inches away from the wall and still get up to a 120-inch projection.</p><p>The projector has 4K as well as Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos in addition to HDR10+, and it does a fantastic job with 4K content. It gets bright enough that I didn't see any issues with it even with plenty of ambient light, and if you've already had a projector and want to switch to a brighter model or need to set up a home theater, this is one of the best models available today. The LTV-3000 Pro retails for $3,999, but for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CR13MB4F?">Prime Day it's available for $2,449</a> — its lowest price yet.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="5d23d16d-2c61-45f8-b393-4f66f974435c" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Other retailers: $2,799 at Best Buy" data-dimension48="Other retailers: $2,799 at Best Buy" data-dimension25="$2449" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CR13MB4F" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:62.87%;"><img id="SPrRfaEbrrWAyRWNjarejC" name="ltv-3000-pro.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SPrRfaEbrrWAyRWNjarejC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1500" height="943" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>The LTV-3000 Pro has outstanding picture quality, and you can easily use it in a room with lots of ambient light.

The LTV-3000 Pro is hassle-free to set up and use, and after a year of use, I can confidently say that it has held up wonderfully. </p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You want built-in Android TV, or you don't need UST tech. In that case, I'd recommend getting the VisionMaster Pro 2; it is considerably brighter, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Valerion-VisionMaster-Pro2-Triple-Projector/dp/B0DSBYCZJR">coming in at $2,389 on Amazon</a>, it is also a good deal. </p><p><strong>Alternative deal: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/XGIMI-Projector-Vision-Enhanced-Lumens/dp/B0D8KRD3JK"><strong>XGIMI Aura 2 </strong></a><strong>—</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/XGIMI-Projector-Vision-Enhanced-Lumens/dp/B0D8KRD3JK"><strong> $2,149 at Amazon</strong></a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CR13MB4F" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="5d23d16d-2c61-45f8-b393-4f66f974435c" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Other retailers: $2,799 at Best Buy" data-dimension48="Other retailers: $2,799 at Best Buy" data-dimension25="$2449">View Deal</a></p></div><p>The only issue with the LTV-3000 Pro is that it doesn't get Android TV installed out of the box. Instead, you get a dongle in the package. This way is honestly better as you can use your own solution — I use the projector with the Shield TV Pro. Other than that, it doesn't have any shortcomings.</p><p>The 2,000 lumen brightness ensures the LTV-3000 Pro gets bright enough even with ambient light, and this hasn't been a problem whatsoever in the year I used the projector. Color quality is outstanding thanks to the laser light source, and it excels at 4K Dolby Vision and HDR content. The built-in sound is great in its own right, but I suggest using it with a soundbar to unlock its full potential — I connected it to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bose-smart-ultra-dolby-atmos-soundbar-ideal-rocking-out">Bose's excellent Smart Home Ultra soundbar</a> and Bass Module 700 subwoofer.</p><p>I use the LTV-3000 Pro with a 90-inch projector, but it goes up to 150 inches, making it the ideal choice if you're just getting started with a home theater. The projector is clearly built to last, and the picture quality gives it a definite edge over most models in this segment. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CR13MB4F">deal pricing of $2,449</a> makes it that much more alluring; it's still quite a lot of cash, but you're also getting one of the best 4K UST projectors available today.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The only explanation would be that you either already have such a powerful charger or you're searching for something higher than 100W.</p><p>Don't forget that a charger like this requires a compatible charger to tap into that max 100W charging speed. In fact, any charger over 60W needs a 5A e-marked cable. If that went over your head, don't worry.

I have a dedicated thermal camera, but it's much more convenient to use a dongle-sized variant that just plugs into your Android phone.</p><p>This is basically what you get with the iSee thermal camera, a diminutive thermal camera that's available with USB-C or Lightning connectors. I used the USB-C model, and it works just as well with any Android phone. The dongle usually sells for $499, but for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Fluke-TC01B-25Hz-Smartphones-Temperature/dp/B0C9H54GLX">Prime Day it is down to $430</a>. This dongle almost never goes on sale, so if you need a diminutive thermal imaging camera, I highly recommend picking it up. And if you need a Lighting-based model, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Fluke-TC01B-25Hz-Smartphones-Temperature/dp/B0CYT1553Q">that's down to $433</a>.

It's automatically detected by the iSee mobile app when you connect it to your Android phone, and it accurately detects any heat spots — I use it extensively to test how hot phones get while gaming. The resolution of 256x192 isn't the best, but it is more than adequate for a thermal camera, and what I like about the dongle is that it detects minor differences in thermal readings.</p><p>You get a range of presets available, and there's even the ability to shoot 25fps footage. The build quality is fantastic; it has a metal chassis, and I didn't see any issues in the six months I used the product. While there are smaller products available, Fluke's consistently-accurate readings and monitoring tools make the iSee an easy recommendation. As I said above, this dongle doesn't usually go on sale, so if you need a thermal imaging camera to monitor heat zones around the house or identify any leakage issues, you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Fluke-TC01B-25Hz-Smartphones-Temperature/dp/B0C9H54GLX">should get it now</a>.</p><p><em><strong>For everything on Amazon Prime Day, head to our </strong></em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><em><strong>ultimate buying guide</strong></em></u></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></p> ]]></dc:content>

If you're in love with the thinness, lightness, and design of the phone, you'll want to look at the transparent or translucent case options since those tend to be ultra-thin.</p><p>Going off of colors, pricing, comfort, and features, the first-party Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 Silicone Case is the best overall choice for your foldable. This case bears a reasonable price tag, comes in the exact <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/what-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-color-should-you-buy">colors of the Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>, adds a kickstand, and has a really soft texture that feels superb to the touch. It's not heavy or chunky either, so you'll be happy to get it along with your Fold 7.</p><p>If you want more robust drop protection, though, there's a vast collection of options waiting to be picked. Thinborn specializes in drop-proofing and ultimate thinness, so the Thinborne Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 600D Aramid Fiber Case is the best slim case to get for your Fold 7. If you want a different design but similar thinness, the RAPTIC Aramid Fiber Case is also a good option for the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7.</p><p>For more budget-conscious buyers, Spigen is the lord and savior. The newly-launched Spigen Airfit Pro MagFit case fits the Fold 7 like a glove while adding intense levels of drop-proofing at the same time. Raised edges all around and spine coverage for barely $35 is a dream made into reality.</p> ]]></dc:content>

That's why I like what Mecool is doing with its range of Android TV solutions; the brand delivers good hardware and a great value, and the KM9 Pro Max continues the momentum.</p><p>The KM9 Pro Max is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/MECOOL-KM9-Pro-Max-Certification/dp/B0DZT22498/">now available for just $63</a>, and that's a terrific value when you consider just what you're getting. The box runs Google TV based on Android 12, includes AV1 decode, and has Netflix integration. Basically, it's a reliable solution if you need an affordable Android TV box, and the interface is just as fast as the Shield TV Pro.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="cbe928aa-60b7-4013-b407-0d004f0c80ea" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="costlier KM2 Plus" data-dimension48="costlier KM2 Plus" data-dimension25="$63" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1476px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.07%;"><img id="eFQ8iyyMcXc4Cr9TrsU9kE" name="km9" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eFQ8iyyMcXc4Cr9TrsU9kE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1476" height="1477" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>The KM9 Pro Max showcases just what's possible with budget Android TV boxes. It is just as fluid as NVIDIA's best-selling Shield TV Pro, and you get an unmatched value. </p><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You need a budget-focused Android TV box with easy access to the Play Store and good fluidity. There's no lag while using the KM9 Pro Max, and it does a great job in daily use. </p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You need Dolby Vision. In that case, you'll need to get the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/MECOOL-KM2-Certification-Assistant-Compatible/dp/B0D62YKJ2S" data-dimension112="cbe928aa-60b7-4013-b407-0d004f0c80ea" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="costlier KM2 Plus" data-dimension48="costlier KM2 Plus" data-dimension25="$63">costlier KM2 Plus</a>. <a class="view-deal button" href="" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="cbe928aa-60b7-4013-b407-0d004f0c80ea" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="costlier KM2 Plus" data-dimension48="costlier KM2 Plus" data-dimension25="$63">View Deal</a></p></div><p>There really isn't much to fault with the KM9 Pro Max. Configuring it is just as easy as any other Android TV box, and it runs the latest iteration of Google TV. While I'm not a fan of what Google is doing with its TV OS, there isn't any lag or slowdown while using the KM9 Pro Max — it is fluid like few boxes in this category.</p><p>You get full access to the Play Store, so you can easily install all your streaming utilities, including Netflix. There's AV1 decode, letting you take full advantage of HDR within YouTube. Although the box comes with 2GB of RAM, I didn't see any issues with lag whatsoever, and Mecool deserves credit for optimizing the UI. You get 32GB of storage as standard.</p><p>The bundled remote has good in-hand feel, and comes with all the buttons you need — and yes, there's a mute button. I don't get why most brands omit the mute button, but I'm glad it's there on the KM9 Pro Max. Overall, this is a reliable Android TV solution if you need something on a budget, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/MECOOL-KM9-Pro-Max-Certification/dp/B0DZT22498/">at $63</a>, it delivers a better value than its rivals.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Google is known for its camera quality, and the Pixel 9 is no slouch. And the photo editing features make it easy to reimagine part of your image, remove distractions, and much more.</p><p>I've used the Pixel 9 on and off since it launched nearly a year ago, designating it as my "camera phone" for moments when I know I'll need a good photo or two. It's just that reliable, and Google has really stepped up the quality of both its hardware and software. You'll also really enjoy the bevy of AI features, which the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> chip is perfectly capable of handling.</p><p>The biggest omission on the Pixel 9 is the lack of a telephoto lens. However, even then, the AI-enhanced digital zoom does wonders, allowing you to zoom up to 8x with minimal loss of quality. It's things like this that help to fill the gaps, ensuring the Pixel 9 retains as much of a flagship experience as possible.</p><p>You can always pay more for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a>, or you can pay less for the lower-end <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">Pixel 9a</a>.

The only major downgrades are the missing mic & speaker for phone calls and the dive-proof design for scuba divers, and most people would give those up to save hundreds of dollars!</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="1cd4efa2-456e-408e-8eb3-30a2eb870a1d" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="also: Epix Pro 47mm - $999.99" data-dimension48="also: Epix Pro 47mm - $999.99" data-dimension25="$609.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Performance-Smartwatch-Technology-Flashlight/dp/B0BYFCZZ9F?th=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1412px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:106.23%;"><img id="JKA3VJNqUBG3e3RjPzPM4P" name="garmin-epix-pro-gen-2-product-image" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JKA3VJNqUBG3e3RjPzPM4P.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1412" height="1500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>also: Epix Pro 47mm - </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Performance-Smartwatch-Technology-Flashlight/dp/B0BYFCRDT9?th=1" data-dimension112="1cd4efa2-456e-408e-8eb3-30a2eb870a1d" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="also: Epix Pro 47mm - $999.99" data-dimension48="also: Epix Pro 47mm - $999.99" data-dimension25="$609.99"><del>$999.99</del> <strong>$617.78 at Amazon<br></strong></a><strong>Epix Pro 43mm - </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Performance-Smartwatch-Technology-Flashlight/dp/B0BYFCX667?th=1"><del>$999</del><strong> $649.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>I've included all three sizes, since these Prime Day Garmin deals tend to sell out quickly.

Normally, I'd recommend checking out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/best-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-deals">best Galaxy Z flip 7 FE preorder deals</a> to try and save a few bucks if you're interested in the new budget foldable.</p><p>This time, things are different. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on">Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE</a> is one of the worst Android phone deals I've seen in some time, and you shouldn't buy it. Instead of paying $900 for the "budget" Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2024-review">Motorola Razr 2024</a> is a much better choice. Its retail price of $699.99 is already cheaper than the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE by a wide margin, but this Amazon Prime Day offer takes another 29% off, hitting a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Unlocked-Camera-Spritz-Orange/dp/B0D3JKR27K/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">standout $499.99 deal price.</a></p><p>The Motorola Razr 2024 is a year old, but so is the hardware inside the "new" Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE.

It starts with only 128GB of base storage, so you'll need to pay even more than that high $899 sticker price to match the Motorola Razr 2024. It's also powered by the Samsung Exynos 2400 chipset, a year-old platform based on the 4nm process that likely isn't much better or worse than the MediaTek chip inside the Razr 2024.</p><p>It's clear that the Razr 2024 is the better choice. It comes with 256GB of base storage by default, features the same 8GB of RAM, has bigger screens, and includes a higher-capacity battery with faster charging speeds. No matter which way you look at it, the Razr 2024 is better overall than the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE — even if their costs were equal.</p><p>Of course, they aren't! This deal price for the Razr 2024 brings the flip phone down under $500, whereas the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE is available for pre-order around the $900 mark. If you were hoping the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE would be your next affordable foldable, fear not, because the Razr 2024 is all that and more.</p><ul><li><em><strong>For more on Prime Day 2025, check out </strong></em><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><em><strong>our ultimate shopping guide</strong></em></u></a><em><strong></strong></em></li></ul><h2 id="prime-day-2025-android-deals-quick-links-32">Prime Day 2025 Android deals — quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-2499727057430809917-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>Prime Day is here: see the full list of Amazon deals</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phones: </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Fref_%3Dnav_cs_gb%26bubble-id%3Dcell-phones-accessories%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-2203694892823443518-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">major discounts on Samsung and Pixel</a></li><li><strong>Tablets: </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dtablets%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-2511409197821828773-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">discounted Galaxy Tab and iPad</a></li><li><strong>Chromebooks: </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dchromebooks%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-7106176835731580750-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">up to 28% off Chromebooks</a></li><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Famazonprime%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-3246680232717780065-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>Most Prime Day deals are members-only: sign up for the 30-day trial</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

You know what else is a great phone? The Galaxy Z Flip 6. Last year's flip phone just received a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D192WWZ9/">massive $300 Prime Day discount</a>, just in time to make way for Samsung's latest and greatest.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Flip 7 launched at the same $1,099 price as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>, so it's not surprising to see the Z Flip 6 receive a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide">Prime Day</a> discount. However, at $300 off, it's even cheaper than the new "affordable" Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE, which starts at $899.

That said, if you'd rather not spend more than $1000 on a new phone, there are plenty of reasons why the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-one-year-later">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> is still worth buying.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Flip 6 is a well-designed phone with impressive durability for a foldable. It also boasts some impressive specs, including a bright display and a powerful Snapdragon chipset. In fact, Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-official-exynos-2500-soc-unpacked-devices-reveal">Exynos 2500 chip</a> appears to be on par with the older Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 powering the Z Flip 6, at least in CPU power.</p><p>And while the Galaxy Z Flip 6 doesn't have the fastest charging speeds, it matches and exceeds those of the Galaxy Z Flip 6, sporting 25W wired and 15W wireless. By contrast, the Galaxy Z Flip 7 drops wireless charging speed to 10W, meaning it will likely take longer to charge its larger battery.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Flip 6 also supports plenty of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> features and will likely receive more features with future updates. After all, Samsung promises 7 years of OS upgrades (with six more to go) for the Z Flip 6, so you don't have to worry about missing out very much if you pick one up now.</p><h2 id="prime-day-2025-android-deals-quick-links-52">Prime Day 2025 Android deals - quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals" target="_blank"><strong>Prime Day is coming: see the full list of Amazon deals</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phones: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals?ref_=nav_cs_gb&bubble-id=cell-phones-accessories" target="_blank">major discounts on Samsung and Pixel</a></li><li><strong>Tablets: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=tablets" target="_blank">discounted Galaxy Tab and iPad</a></li><li><strong>Wearables: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=smartwatches" target="_blank">up to %45 off Garmin watches</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime" target="_blank"><strong>Most Prime Day deals are members-only: sign up for the 30-day trial</strong></a></li></ul><p><em><strong>For everything on Amazon Prime Day, head to our </strong></em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><em><strong>ultimate shopping guide</strong></em></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></p> ]]></dc:content>

It seems this software is another Samsung alternative to Android Auto. As the publication notes, the Korean OEM already provides "Samsung Auto" on its Galaxy phones sold in China. The tipster showed off an alleged look at its UI, which seems to feature whatever app you're using in an off-center area.</p><p>The top right features a tile that says "Good Evening, listen to the brief for..." It reminds us of Samsung's Now Brief feature in One UI 7 (and 8) for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-launch">the Galaxy S25 series</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-z-flip-7-fold-7-flagship-launch-flip-7-fe">recent foldables</a>. Beneath that, with a music note, is a default music app that drivers can take advantage of. This alleged design also sports a navigation bar similar to Galaxy phones and two app bars.</p><p>The tipster claims Samsung's "Auto Dex" will support "8500+ car models of 120+ brands." Additionally, there's a chance users can activate this on their phone. Perhaps that speculation holds merit, considering this rumored look features One UI's navigational icons.</p><h2 id="samsung-continues-with-its-own-take-2">Samsung continues with its own take</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here's a FIRST LOOK at Samsung's 'Auto DeX', supporting 8500+ car models of 120+ brands.

In response <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/GalaxyTechie/status/1942784264463938043">to a comment</a>, the tipster claims "Auto Dex" has not entered internal testing, but rather this is simply "a very early implementation of DeX on Samsung Auto."</p><p>The folks at 9to5 and their long memory brought up Google's old <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-auto-phone-screens-discontinued">Android Auto for phone screens</a>, which was discontinued back in 2022. Essentially, users could have everything Android Auto offered, but in a small package: their phone. This rumored "Auto Dex" from Samsung seems to have been created in a similar vein. There seems to be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/GalaxyTechie/status/1942272781061874011">a slim chance</a> that users outside of China will also get this feature, but we'll have to wait and see.</p><p>As far as Android Auto is concerned, for the rest of us, a recent rumor suggests Google is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-auto/android-auto-smart-glasses-integration-code-rumors">working on integrating smart glasses</a>. Those hopes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-auto/android-auto-update-smart-glasses-mention-dashed">were quickly dashed</a> after an update for Android Auto removed all mentions of "glasses" within its code. There's speculation that there could've been a translation error, considering that the rumor originated from an overseas discovery.</p><p>It's also worth mentioning that Samsung was also spotted working on its own version of Android's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-android-earthquake-alerts-user-emergency-control">earthquake alerts</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

But those aren't always easy to tote around with you, especially if you don't carry a large bag around at all times. That's where the Onyx Boox Palma 2 comes in, a phone-sized e-reader that's currently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/BOOX-Mobile-Fingerprint-Recognition-Microphones/dp/B0DTTV6M81"><strong>10% off</strong></a> for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide">Prime Day</a>.</p><p>While 10% isn't the biggest discount we've seen during Amazon's 4-day event, Onyx doesn't regularly discount the Boox Palma or Palma 2, so it's a rare deal. If you don't believe me, check out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0DTTV6M81">Camelcamelcamel page</a> and look at the <em>very</em> flat price graph over the past few months.</p><p>The first time I got the original Palma at the end of 2023, my wife immediately laid claim to it when I was done writing the review. Once the second one came out, the upgrade was a no-brainer, especially given how often she uses it. That thing goes with her everywhere!</p><p>For the cost of a budget-priced phone, you'll be getting a cutting-edge Android-powered e-reader with a gorgeous black & white Carta E Ink display. It's got a fast refresh rate that feels more like a normal screen than an old Kindle, but the eye-friendly nature of E Ink and its ultra comfortable display that's easy to see in any light.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><strong>Prime Day deals and FAQ</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-ca-5457778577287776063-20" target="_blank"><strong>Shop all Amazon Prime Day deals</strong></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="98acb03b-cccb-4f27-b1e8-a4b943e16fd9" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Was: $299.99" data-dimension48="Was: $299.99" data-dimension25="$" href="https://www.amazon.com/BOOX-Mobile-Fingerprint-Recognition-Microphones/dp/B0DTTV6M81" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="qPf7RC9nxBcva3iUT6gRGf" name="onyx-boox-palma-2-square-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qPf7RC9nxBcva3iUT6gRGf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Onyx Boox Palma 2 📖</strong></p><p><strong>Was: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/BOOX-Mobile-Fingerprint-Recognition-Microphones/dp/B0DTTV6M81" target="_blank" data-dimension112="98acb03b-cccb-4f27-b1e8-a4b943e16fd9" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Was: $299.99" data-dimension48="Was: $299.99" data-dimension25="$"><del>$299.99</del></a></p><p><strong>Now:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BOOX-Mobile-Fingerprint-Recognition-Microphones/dp/B0DTTV6M81" target="_blank"><strong>$269.99 at Amazon</strong></a><em></em></p><p>"Unlike a Kindle, you can get your books, apps, or whatever you want from anywhere you want on the Palma 2.

It's a great way to read content from anywhere since it's powered by Android and isn't locked behind a walled garden like an Amazon Kindle.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you're looking for a full E Ink phone replacement. This might be the size of a phone, but you can't stick a SIM card in it. It's also only a black & white display, so no fancy color E Ink here.</p><p><strong>Price check 💵: </strong><a href="https://www.target.com/p/boox-6-13-palma2/-/A-1001353904">$299 at Target</a> |<strong> </strong><a href="https://shop.boox.com/products/palma2">$299 at Onyx</a></p><p><strong>Alternative deal 🪙: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bigme-Smartphone-Hibreak-Android-36-Level/dp/B0FF4FWQFP"><strong>Bigme Hibreak Pro E Ink phone - </strong><del>$459</del><strong> $436.05 at Amazon</strong></a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/BOOX-Mobile-Fingerprint-Recognition-Microphones/dp/B0DTTV6M81" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="98acb03b-cccb-4f27-b1e8-a4b943e16fd9" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Was: $299.99" data-dimension48="Was: $299.99" data-dimension25="$">View Deal</a></p></div><p>The Onyx Boox Palma 2 is an upgrade over the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/onyx-boox-palma-review">Boox Palma</a> in subtle ways, but that doesn't mean it's not nicer to use. One of the best new features is the fingerprint scanner built into the side-mounted power button, something the original release didn't have. That means you can have the same level of biometric security on your e-reader as you do on your phone!</p><p>It's also got a newer, faster chipset inside and comes installed with Android 13, whereas the original release only features Android 11. The OS version doesn't usually matter much on these types of devices since security updates are often delivered through the Google Play backend, but apps eventually stop supporting older versions of Android, so having something newer is always preferable.</p><p>Aside from the diminutive size that you'll love, this display is something you need to see in action, especially if you're coming from an older e-reader like a Kindle. Gone are the days when the whole screen would have to flash just to change the page. This one refreshes more like a normal phone display and can even play back videos and games so long as you don't mind that it's only black & white.</p><p>Plus, since it's E Ink, it's actually <em>easier</em> to read in the sun than inside, the polar opposite of most phones. That, plus the eye-friendly nature of E Ink displays and a backlight that's totally flicker-free, ensures that you can read for hours on end without worrying about eye strain. It's a win-win!</p><ul><li>For more on Prime Day 2025, check out <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><strong>our ultimate shopping guide</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

What's interesting about this listing is that it appears Samsung has prepared its S25 FE with wireless charging capabilities. The WPC states the device has received Qi2 (v2.1.0) certification. Another standout for this listing is a surprising real-life image of the S25 FE.</p><p>We've heard rumors about the S25 FE sticking close to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-launch">the flagship S25 series'</a> design, which is typically the trend.</p><p>The WPC's real-life image showed the phone's display and back. It's hard to see, but it doesn't seem like the S25 FE will sport thick bezels. They seem relatively thin. The photo also shows its centered punch-hole selfie camera. The look at its rear panel shows off the phone in a black option, perhaps fancied up as "Black Shadow" or something like that.</p><p>Samsung's name (logo) is centered at the bottom, but its triple rear camera array is another talking point. It seems the S25 FE will shy away from its flagship family in one way, by removing the thick, black lens rings. Instead, the WPC's image suggests the phone will have shiny silvery rings for its camera lenses. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-z-flip-7-fold-7-flagship-launch-flip-7-fe">new Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> has the same change, so perhaps this is to be expected.</p><h2 id="the-next-fe-2">The Next FE</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:615px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:97.56%;"><img id="L88f8MpTKHDcbtmjh7xm2Q" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-fe-wpc-listing" alt="The World Power Consortium's Qi2 certification listing for the Galaxy S25 FE shows its real-life look, with silver rings around its cameras and relatively thin display bezels." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/L88f8MpTKHDcbtmjh7xm2Q.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="615" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: World Power Consortium)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We're still in the dark about an important charging spec: its strength. It's nice that the WPC's listing highlights Qi2 support for the Galaxy S25 FE, but the flagship series also has this—<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-support-qi2-wireless-charging">and in a weird way, at that</a>. While the entire flagship series features Qi2 wireless charging at 15W, the phones don't natively have magnets inside. This means consumers will need a case with those magnets available.</p><p>The publication speculates Samsung might go down a similar route with the S25 FE, too. It just remains to be seen if the charging wattage remains the same.</p><p>We got our first alleged look at the S25 FE <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s25-fe-leak-shows-a-design-youve-definitely-seen-before">through a rendering leak</a> in mid-June. One thing rumored was that this phone is thinner than the S24 FE. Rumors claim the S25 FE measures 7.4mm. It's not something insane, but consumers might notice it when holding it. The phone is also supposedly on the way with a 6.7-inch display, which might <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-fe-display-could-get-a-flagship-grade-treatment">get a flagship-level upgrade</a>.</p><p>A more recent rumor claims the device's screen could be more flexible, as Samsung might drop the more rigid OLED tech. This is reportedly the catalyst behind the thinner S25 FE build.</p><p>Elsewhere, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s25-fe-selfie-camera-upgrade-rumored">rumors about its cameras</a> suggest its selfie camera could jump to 12MP. Speculation is still unclear about its main set of lenses, but the previous generation offered a 50MP primary, a 12MP ultrawide, and an 8MP telephoto.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

But while many people complained about its high price, you won't have to deal with that huge negative point since the Pixel Fold is now on sale for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://electronics.woot.com/offers/new-google-pixel-fold-5g-smartphone"><strong>$1,220 off</strong></a> during Woot's own Prime Day event.</p><p>That brings the original $1,799 price down to <strong>just $579.99</strong> for 256GB model. I certainly expected to see the Pixel Fold drop in price by this time, but that kind of discount is usually reserved for some broken, second-hand model. This one is brand new, but it's a fairly limited stock, so if you're interested, you should grab it ASAP!</p><p>The two reasons I loved the Pixel Fold at launch were for its unique form factor and its cameras. No other book-style foldable has the unique passport-like aspect ratio of the Pixel Fold, and few foldables to this day can match the versatility of the triple camera system on the back, including a fantastic 5x optical zoom periscope camera.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><strong>Prime Day deals and FAQ</strong></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="f7943aee-3450-47f7-880b-f37308360ff7" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Was: $1,799.99" data-dimension48="Was: $1,799.99" data-dimension25="$" href="https://electronics.woot.com/offers/new-google-pixel-fold-5g-smartphone" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:86.08%;"><img id="NYxUxhRnsEyV7LUNmA6g2J" name="Google-Pixel-Fold-render-official-obsidian-all-angles.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NYxUxhRnsEyV7LUNmA6g2J.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1763" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Google Pixel Fold 📩📲</strong></p><p><strong>Was: </strong><a href="https://electronics.woot.com/offers/new-google-pixel-fold-5g-smartphone" target="_blank" data-dimension112="f7943aee-3450-47f7-880b-f37308360ff7" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Was: $1,799.99" data-dimension48="Was: $1,799.99" data-dimension25="$"><del>$1,799.99</del></a></p><p><strong>Now:</strong> <a href="https://electronics.woot.com/offers/new-google-pixel-fold-5g-smartphone" target="_blank"><strong>$579.99 at Woot!</strong></a></p><p><em>Woot is an Amazon company, so Prime members get free shipping!</em></p><p>"After years of speculation and anticipation, Google actually made its own foldable Pixel phone.

While Samsung's newly announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> is finally thinner than Google's 2-year-old foldable, it took the world's biggest smartphone company that long to catch up.</p><p>I also can't give Google enough praise for the aspect ratio of this device. It's shorter and wider than any other book-style foldable, making it easy to use the outer screen whenever you feel like using something smaller. When it's unfolded, this wider aspect ratio makes apps default to tablet view, something book-style foldables should have done <em>ages</em> ago. Google switched to a taller, narrower design on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, and I hate it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="aZmjh6UgqPZgH9yhKAG6jY" name="pixel-9-pro-fold-pixel-fold-multitasking.jpg" alt="Multitasking on Pixel 9 Pro Fold and Pixel Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aZmjh6UgqPZgH9yhKAG6jY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>My colleague, Andrew Myrick, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/my-week-with-the-google-pixel-fold">published a second opinion piece</a> a few months after my original Pixel Fold review.

It seems like batteries can smell our fear and desperation, because they always tend to run out during the worst possible moments. A smart decision to prevent this is to buy a decent stockpile ahead of time.</p><p>Amazon Prime Day is the best time of the year to stock up on batteries. Buying in bulk is smart as it reduces the unit price, but you can really leverage the economies of scale by buying in bulk during awesome sales like Prime Day or Black Friday.</p><p>Be sure to check out what sort of batteries your remotes, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-trackers">Bluetooth trackers</a>, smart home accessories, and other gadgets use.

It's a wise idea to accumulate a stockpile of these 3V CR2032 batteries while they're dirt cheap thanks to Prime Day sales. This 20-pack from LiCB has a shelf life of three years, which should be good enough since CR2032 lithium cells get used up pretty quickly. If you're not big on amassing such a large number of these batteries, you can score a sweet bargain on the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LiCB-CR2032-Lithium-Battery-10-Pack/dp/B071D4DKTZ/" data-dimension112="6c7915cd-582a-4be5-87c9-a2638adbf176" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="10-pack for $5 on Amazon" data-dimension48="10-pack for $5 on Amazon" data-dimension25="$7.19">10-pack for $5 on Amazon</a> as well.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/LiCB-Long-Lasting-Capacity-Batteries-Adaptive/dp/B085TBDN8Q/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="6c7915cd-582a-4be5-87c9-a2638adbf176" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="10-pack for $5 on Amazon" data-dimension48="10-pack for $5 on Amazon" data-dimension25="$7.19">View Deal</a></p></div><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="f913ece0-6f13-4eaa-a5b8-56a8d53730fa" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="While AA batteries aren't used as frequently, some of your stuff like a smart home camera or selfie light might require this size.

You don't want them going bad from disuse, rotting away in your pantry or store room.</p><p>After shelf life longevity, the next best thing to do is to invest in battery sizes you know you use frequently. There's no point in hoarding D or C cells when nothing in your home uses them. On the other hand, AAA batteries and CR2032 batteries are used in nearly everything that's battery-operated these days. Check your home equipment and gear before placing your order.</p><p><em><strong>For everything to do with Amazon Prime Day, head to our </strong></em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><em><strong>ultimate buying guide</strong></em></u></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></p> ]]></dc:content>

Without much adieu, let's unpack everything that was announced this year!</p><h2 id="galaxy-z-fold-7-and-flip-7-2">Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Flip 7</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="soTr5M9upbEv8B8hMnHdZE" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-flip-7-mint-hands-on-3" alt="Samsung Galaxy Fold 7 and Flip 7 in Mint hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/soTr5M9upbEv8B8hMnHdZE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This year, Samsung outdid itself with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a>, the clamshell shows up in an all-new look, sporting a larger screen space than usual. To begin, it sheds its usual folder-like camera bar for the largest ever edge-to-edge cover screen on a Galaxy Z Flip series.</p><p>It's a no-brainer that the 4.1-inch Super AMOLED FlexWindow will allow users to do more when right from its cover screen when the device is flipped shut. The Flip 7 gets a larger 6.9-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X screen and a 120 Hz refresh rate. Both the internal and external displays are protected by Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2.</p><p>As for its cameras, the Z Flip 7 gets a 50 MP wide and a 12MP ultra-wide lens, along with a 10 MP selfie shooter.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="iCiJNJyhNsZubA23MoZGA6" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on-24" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 Now Brief hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iCiJNJyhNsZubA23MoZGA6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This time around, even with its foldables, Samsung wanted to take the word "slim" to the next level. With the Galaxy Z Flip 7, the Korean OEM promises a "pocket-sized AI-powerhouse." Measuring a compact 13.7mm when folded, the clamshell weighs only 188 grams. Aiding it to stay thin is Samsung's updated hinge mechanism, the Armor FlexHinge. The Korean OEM seems to be proving that powerful things can also come in small packages.</p><p>As sleek as it is, under the hood, the Galaxy Z Flip 7 is powered by Samsung's recently revealed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-official-exynos-2500-soc-unpacked-devices-reveal">Exynos 2500 SoC</a>, which will help run all the new Galaxy AI features that come with One UI 8 out of the box. These features include the new Now Bar and Now Brief, as seen in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-launch">Galaxy S25 series. </a>Additionally, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-gemini-more-in-store-android-samsung-unpacked">Gemini Live</a> swoops in on the cover display, bringing useful hands-free assistance for a range of topics.</p><p>This pocket-sized dynamite of a phone comes with a 4,300mAh battery, delivering "up to 31 hours of video on a single charge." The Galaxy Z Flip 7 is available in two storage configurations: 12/256GB and 12/512GB, and in three colorways: Blue Shadow, Jet Black, and Coral Red. The Mint is reserved for online purchases only. Preorders begin today, and it is set to hit stores on July 25, starting at $1,099.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="eywqvFaRMzpU9poUfE3Cr3" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on-32" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 hinges hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eywqvFaRMzpU9poUfE3Cr3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung is flexing hard with its new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> as it arrives as the thinnest and almost creaseless foldable yet. Measuring  8.9mm when folded and 4.2mm when unfolded. Despite its slender profile, Samsung says the phone is built to last everyday's wear and tear with a resturctured Armor FlexHinge and foldable display.</p><p>To keep its form factor this slim, the company has also ditched S-Pen compatibility with the phone, citing that the majority of Fold users don't really reach for the accessory.  The Z Fold 7 arrives with a much wider 6.5-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2x cover display that Samsung says has, 21:9 aspect ratio. Things get even better when the device is unfolded, with an 8-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2x screen that gets 2,600nits of peak brightness.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5333px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LeupYBjJLH3TukZ3DiV2X5" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on-Blue-Shadow-5" alt="Blue Shadow" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LeupYBjJLH3TukZ3DiV2X5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5333" height="3000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung's new foldable is powered by the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-soc-for-galaxy-s25-series">Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a>, which Samsung states will fuel its Galaxy AI features.

While the cover display and internal display both have 10MP selfie shooters.</p><p>The device brings the "Ultra" experience, even on the software front, it gets One UI 8 (Android 16), right out of the box. Galaxy AI on this larger screen device adds "AI Results view," which lets users do more, without needing to switch between apps. Drawing Assist, Writing Assist, and Drag & Drop help with multitasking on the Galaxy Z Fold 7. It's worth noting Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-gemini-more-in-store-android-samsung-unpacked">major AI announcement for Android</a>, which brings Circle to Search updates and an improved Gemini Live experience.</p><p>To keep things going for the user all day, the 4,400mAh battery setup, and the phone comes with three different storage options: 12/256GB, 12/512GB, or 16/1TB.

Choosing a phone color is relatively easier, but some might be stumped by this step as well. The simplest way to make a choice you won't regret is to get something that's your favorite color. And if you don't have a favorite, just go for the black option. There's a reason why black is a staple in fashion; it's a no-brainer whether you're buying clothes, shoes, phones, or smartwatches.</p><p>Our number one recommendation from this year's assortment is the Blue Shadow version of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7. This deep blue has a mesmerising quality to it, almost resembling the deep, calm waters of the ocean at night or a classic pair of dark blue jeans. The shape of the Z Fold 7 looks rather striking in this coat of paint.</p><p>Fans of lighter hues should stick to the Silver Shadow option. There's no white variant of the Fold 7 this time around, but the silver color is a fitting replacement to appease those who delight in lighter shades.</p> ]]></dc:content>

There's still something to please everyone on the roster. Retaining the Jet Black colorway was the smartest move on Samsung's part since it's a basic shade that is a safe choice for most people.</p><p>Those who prefer a bolder, spicier paint job will be pleased with the Coral Red hue that we saw on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 series</a>. It's very reminiscent of the hot chilli red <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-9-review">ASUS Zenfone 9</a> variant that went over massively well with the crowds a few years ago. I will never get over that shade, which is why it brings me boundless joy to see a similar color on the Galaxy S25 and now the Galaxy Z Flip 7.</p><p>If you're not too bold but also tired of a plain black phone, Blue Shadow provides a healthy balance of both. It's not a plain Jane blue hue; the steely dark blue compliments the sleek profile of the Flip 7. Darker colors don't get dirty as easily as lighter colors and small scratches are less noticeable too, so you still retain the benefits of a darker shade like Jet Black.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Depending on what finish and drop protection levels you're after, picking the best Galaxy Z Flip 7 case is straightforward business. I don't recommend using your $1,500 phone without a case, especially since repairs on a foldable phone cost a fortune.</p><p>Regardless, my top choice will always be the ultra-thin Thinborne Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 600D Aramid Fiber Case. At 0.04 inches, it's mind-blowing just how slim and lightweight the Thinborne case truly is. The hefty price tag justifies itself several times over when you consider the quality and set of features you get. There's a tempered glass screen protector for the cover display included with the case. It's hard to believe the case also supports <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phones">MagSafe and Qi2 accessories</a>.</p><p>Money might be an object of concern, in which case I have several cheaper recommendations that don't compromise quality. Spigen should be your go-to brand when looking for high-quality products on a tighter budget. The new Airfit Pro MagFit is highly robust, boasting military-grade drop-proofing, but it weighs next to nothing and hardly adds any bulk at all. Admittedly, the hinge is thick, but this is to defend the weakest link of the Flip 7.</p><p>If you choose a case that doesn't come with a screen guard, you should buy one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/best-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-screen-protectors">best Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 screen protectors</a> for your expensive new foldable.</p> ]]></dc:content>

That means you have about two weeks to take advantage of preorder deals before they're gone.</p><h2 id="what-are-the-specs-of-the-galaxy-z-flip-7-2">What are the specs of the Galaxy Z Flip 7?</h2><p>Similar to past Z Flip phones, the Galaxy Z Flip 7 is a clamshell device with two displays and a sturdy folding hinge. That's pretty much where the similarities end, as Samsung has packed the new generation with an upgraded, edge-to-edge cover display, some new hardware, and the lightest, thinnest frame of any Flip series phone to date. The battery is also larger than ever, plus you get all of the latest Galaxy AI software features with seven years of OS and security upgrades guaranteed.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="FMDCXKz2GJ2bYHLk7G2s96" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on-33" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FMDCXKz2GJ2bYHLk7G2s96.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1407" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="should-i-buy-the-galaxy-z-flip-7-or-galaxy-z-flip-7-fe-2">Should I buy the Galaxy Z Flip 7 or Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE?</h2><p>Although we haven't been able to study the two phones side by side just yet, it's most likely going to depend on your budget and what you're looking for in a foldable phone. With a starting price of $899.99, the FE is a bit more affordable than the standard Z Flip 7, but the trade-off is a weaker processor and less battery life. Whether or not that's a dealbreaker is up to you, but I'd start by seeing how much you can save using one of the preorder deals above. Who knows, maybe the right deal could make this question completely moot.</p> ]]></dc:content>

In the week leading up to Unpacked and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> unveiling, I spent some time with the Galaxy Z Flip 6, so I wasn't coming into it with no reference point.</p><p>After going hands-on with the Flip 7, my immediate impressions were surprisingly more positive than I expected. Despite only using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-one-year-later">Flip 6</a> for about a week, the Flip 7 seems like a massive upgrade.</p><h2 id="it-s-all-about-the-flexwindow-2">It's all about the FlexWindow</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="rUsKKPFxvJ7nnKUJfrfz4" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-cover-screen-selfies-hands-on-2" alt="Selfie camera using cover screen on Galaxy Z Flip 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rUsKKPFxvJ7nnKUJfrfz4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The most obvious reason why I feel this way has to do with the FlexWindow, which is getting supercharged. The screen itself is much larger, as it now wraps around the dual cameras that are still found in the bottom right corner, similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Razr Ultra 2025</a>.

And if you're tired of the clock widget hiding the face of a loved one on the FlexWindow, it's been updated to adapt and fit around the subject. I can't really help but feel like Samsung took a page from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/everything-apple-stole-from-android-and-wear-os-at-wwdc-2025">Apple and iOS 26</a>, but it's still a welcome addition.</p><p>The last thing that I want to mention about the FlexWindow isn't all that great. Samsung spent a lot of time talking about all of the functionality being added, which is wonderful, but you still can't use any app without <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-set-up-and-use-apps-on-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-cover-screen">Good Lock and MultiStar</a>.</p><p>I'm genuinely curious and confused as to why Samsung didn't make this one of the defining features of the Flip 7. It would've been the best time to do so, given the expanded cover screen. And while the other new features are more than welcome, it just feels like a missed opportunity.</p><h2 id="exynos-replaces-snapdragon-2">Exynos replaces Snapdragon</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="DuJAb8juw4oqbdoMCin956" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on-1" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 home screen main display hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DuJAb8juw4oqbdoMCin956.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Of course, the FlexWindow isn't the only attraction of the Flip 7, as the main display has also been improved. It sports a 6.9-inch Dynamic 2X AMOLED panel, with Samsung opting to make it a bit wider than the Flip 6, with the company pointing out that the Flip 7 is almost as wide as the Galaxy S25 Plus.</p><p>While the upgrades are definitely welcome, I was pretty surprised to learn that the Flip 7 will <em>not</em> be powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-vs-regular-snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a>.
