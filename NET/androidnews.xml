T-Mobile is officially closing the popular loophole, and the change is effective starting October 24, 2025.</p><p>T-Mobile has officially ended a long-standing workaround that allowed some customers to score the $5 per-line AutoPay discount while still paying their bills with a credit card. As reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://tmo.report/2025/10/t-mobile-ends-credit-card-autopay-loophole/" target="_blank">The Mobile Report</a>, users who prepay their bills using ineligible payment methods will lose their AutoPay discount for that billing cycle.</p><p>The change puts an end to a payment workaround that many savvy subscribers had been using to enjoy both T-Mobile’s monthly discount and credit card perks like cash back or travel points.</p><p>Previously, customers could set up AutoPay with a debit card or bank account to qualify for the discount, but then pay their bill early with a credit card. The system would still show an eligible payment method and apply the discount, even though the actual payment did not qualify.</p><h2 id="t-mobile-s-system-now-catches-you-2">T-Mobile's system now catches you</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1990px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="BvTcxLK4iRKgLdiYgUZd9T" name="T-Mobile-Store.jpeg" alt="T-Mobile store sign" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BvTcxLK4iRKgLdiYgUZd9T.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1990" height="1119" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>T-Mobile is now tightening its billing logic to ensure the discount only applies when the actual payment is made with an approved method. The company says customers who prepay their bill partially or in full using a credit card or another unsupported option will automatically forfeit the discount for that month.</p><p>The policy has been in place since 2023 when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-t-mobile-phones">T-Mobile</a> officially excluded credit cards from AutoPay eligibility, but this recent update closes the technical gap that made the loophole possible. Affected customers will start receiving text notifications informing them that their AutoPay discount has been removed for the upcoming billing cycle.</p><p>To keep getting the $5 per-line discount, customers must use a debit card or bank account as their payment method and avoid making early payments with a credit card. If you prefer paying with a credit card for the rewards, you’ll need to decide whether those perks are worth giving up the recurring discount.</p><p>For families or multi-line plans, losing that $5 per line can quickly add up, potentially costing an extra $20 or more each month, depending on the number of lines on the account, as pointed out by one subscriber on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/1oebrsa/comment/nl14pdh/" target="_blank">Reddit</a>.</p><p>For now, there’s no indication that T-Mobile plans to extend credit card eligibility again, so if you want to keep saving on your bill, sticking with a debit card or bank account is the only way to go.</p> ]]></dc:content>

I've used several cameras over the years, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/this-dongle-sized-thermal-camera-is-astonishingly-good">Thermal Master's P2</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/this-fluke-dongle-brings-a-thermal-camera-to-your-android-phone">Fluke iSee</a>. The latter is interesting because it's made by a brand that's known for its industrial tools, and in did a good job in my usage.</p><p>Not to be outdone, Thermal Master rolled out the P3, which is arguably the best thermal camera dongle you can get today. The dongle connects over USB-C, and I didn't have any issues using it with my Galaxy Z Fold 7 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-17-pro-review">iPhone 17 Pro</a>. The P3 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Thermal-Master-P3-Imaging-Camera/dp/B0FF4YFCS9">retails for $299 on Amazon</a>, and it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://thermalmaster.com/products/thermal-master-p3-pcb-master">costs the same on the brand's website</a>. If you're buying via Thermal Master's site, you get an additional 10% off by using code <strong>Android10</strong>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="KQ9SLffcmPKq3CbgSiEzsS" name="Thermal Master P3" alt="Thermal Master P3 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KQ9SLffcmPKq3CbgSiEzsS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The P3 is considerably bigger than its predecessor, but even then, it weighs just 26g, and is easily portable anywhere. It comes in a hard shell case that gives the dongle additional protection, not that it needs it — it is made out of aluminum, and build quality is great.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="Nn78sdEWxikz6p4Uennf9T" name="Thermal Master P3" alt="Thermal Master P3 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Nn78sdEWxikz6p4Uennf9T.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This doesn't make any difference to its usability, but I like that the P3's design has gold accents. The IR camera has a resolution of 512×384, and it is a definite upgrade over the Fluke iSee, which does 256x192. You also get a wider range of color palettes, and you get manual focus as well.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="PX7L8RojafBoykbG7xH5FT" name="Thermal Master P3" alt="Thermal Master P3 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PX7L8RojafBoykbG7xH5FT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The camera is useful if you need to identify hotspots, or in my case, see just how hot a phone gets while running a game, and where that heat is going. I get that it's a niche use case, but the P3 does a good job in this regard, and I used it extensively over the last two months.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="f2S4Kwv5EhM4rfddxNC3AT" name="Thermal Master P3" alt="Thermal Master P3 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f2S4Kwv5EhM4rfddxNC3AT.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="RNWVUkRKfQa9taiGe69uFT" name="Thermal Master P3" alt="Thermal Master P3 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RNWVUkRKfQa9taiGe69uFT.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>It also has a high threshold, able to measure temperatures between  -4 degrees F to 1122 degrees F (-20 degrees C to 600 degrees C), making it a good choice if you need a dongle-sized thermal camera during home maintenance tasks. Rounding out the features, the P3 doesn't use much power, and I didn't see any issues using it with my devices.</p><p>As these things go, the P3 delivers everything I need in a thermal camera, and while it is costlier, it does a better job than any of its rivals.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The most noticeable change is the new icons, which are now bigger and more rounded. This gives the app a fresher look that matches <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-unveils-the-most-massive-android-redesign-ever">Google's current style</a>.</p><p>Inside the video player, the differences are more noticeable. The landscape mode button is now encased in a circle and slightly larger, making it easier to spot. The dimmed background when pausing a video has been removed, letting thumbnails and details remain visible.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:406px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:214.29%;"><img id="LMuaMq7a3BnbzTtnaK29mi" name="YouTube-player-redesign-Android" alt="YouTube video player with enhanced buttons and icons" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LMuaMq7a3BnbzTtnaK29mi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="406" height="870" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>YouTube also fine-tuned the skip-forward and rewind animations to be less jarring, so skipping ahead doesn’t interrupt the flow of what you’re watching.</p><h2 id="landscape-mode-is-finally-clean-2">Landscape mode is finally clean</h2><p>Landscape mode now looks much cleaner. All the main controls like thumbs up, thumbs down, comments, save, and share are grouped together in a pill-shaped container in the bottom-left corner.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2316px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:46.63%;"><img id="ABCe5ZEEgg8fHY6TPopyq6" name="YouTube-player-landscape-mode" alt="Youtube player in landscape mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ABCe5ZEEgg8fHY6TPopyq6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2316" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of the more playful additions is the dynamic “like” animation. When you hit the thumbs-up button, you’ll now see themed animations depending on the video type, like floating music notes for songs. It’s a small but clever way to make engagement a bit more fun.</p><p>YouTube is also fixing a common complaint about the comment section. It now has a proper threaded design, making it much easier to follow conversations and see who is replying to whom. This update helps organize what was once a confusing area.</p><p>The rollout is already underway globally for Android and iOS, though not everyone will see it right away. If the redesign hasn’t reached your device yet, relaunching the app might help trigger it.</p><p>Google is describing this as YouTube’s biggest UI refresh in years. The new player interface is designed to be less intrusive, obscuring as little of the video as possible.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Several <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-early-impressions">Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a> users on Reddit have reported seeing a mysterious question mark(?) instead of the percentage.</p><p>This issue seems to be cropping up for users who have wireless chargers, particularly third-party or non-Qi2 certified chargers, but this is still speculation(as first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://piunikaweb.com/2025/10/23/some-pixel-10-pro-fold-users-are-seeing-a-question-mark-on-the-battery-icon/">Piunika Web</a>).

Some say it could be an underlying hardware issue, like the battery failing, while others believe it's a simple UI problem that a quick fix could resolve.  One user even said that "A lot of this has been happening since the last play security update. I suspect it will come out as just a bug, but you're smart to reach out to Google to see what they recommend."</p><p>That said, it isn't just the new Pixel 10 Pro Fold facing these issues; some<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelFold/comments/1nv5sqz/pixel_9_fold_battery_question_mark/"> 9 Pro Fold users </a>also seem to have spotted the weird '?' icon next to their battery, where one user stated that the error message they got was "Unable to read battery meters".

Only time will tell. But for now, if you're seeing this issue, a temporary fix, all you have to do is to reboot the phone, which returns the correct battery percentage. If you still don't see it fixing this bug, you should contact Google Support for further guidance or a possible warranty claim.</p><p>Google's spokesperson also confirmed to Android Central that rebooting the device will resolve the issue; however, "Pixel 10 Pro Fold users should use certified Qi2 wireless chargers."

The patent infringement case was first filed by Strava against Garmin on Sept. 30 in the U.S. District Court for Colorado. As of Oct. 21, Strava submitted a court filing to dismiss the suit entirely.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2025/10/strava-drops-voluntarily-lawsuit-against.html" target="_blank">DC Rainmaker</a>, the filing signals Strava is abandoning its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/strava-sues-garmin-over-live-segments-and-heatmaps">patent infringement case against Garmin</a>, which centered around heat maps and live segments. At the time, Strava requested a permanent injunction on the sale of Garmin watches and bike computers that it claimed used its patented technology.</p><p>The case never materialized further as Strava pulled the lawsuit before the two companies had the chance to state their positions before a judge. “Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(1)(A)(i), Plaintiff Strava, Inc., by and through its undersigned counsel, voluntarily dismisses the above-captioned action, without prejudice," the succinct court filing states.</p><p>Garmin and Strava appeared to have a close relationship before the lawsuit, with Garmin data being a key part of Strava's platform. It's unclear how the two companies will interact going forward, or what may have transpired behind the scenes. Either way, it looks like Strava's aggressive move against Garmin is coming to a quick end.</p><h2 id="how-strava-and-garmin-got-here-2">How Strava and Garmin got here</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="BAMRnLTQkKJsxq6dissQVX" name="Strava-Performance-Predictions-vs-Garmin-Race-Predictor" alt="The Strava app showing Performance Prediction times for the author's current condition for 5K, 10K, half marathon, and full marathon races, with a Garmin Fenix 8 draped above the bottom-right of the phone showing a different marathon prediction time." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BAMRnLTQkKJsxq6dissQVX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Strava's dispute with Garmin not only transpired via court filings, but also in public.

The post criticized Garmin's developer guidelines for API partners, which as of July 1 required the Garmin logo to appear on content including its data.</p><p>"Unfortunately we could not justify to our users complying with the new guidelines," Salazar wrote. "As such, we have tried to resolve this situation with Garmin over the course of the past five months, including proposing additional attribution across the platform in a less intrusive way, but to no avail."</p><blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/1nw8u98/setting_the_record_straight_about_garmin">Setting the record straight about Garmin</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava">r/Strava</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><p>In the post's replies, many Strava users criticizing the move, stating that they likely wouldn't pay for or use the platform without Garmin data and integrations.

The operating system, based on Android 16, builds off the One UI 7 overhaul while adding new features and doubling down on Galaxy AI. Now, Samsung is bringing the One UI 8 update to the Galaxy S21 FE — and it's likely going to be its final major Android OS upgrade.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s21-fe-last-major-one-ui-update-released/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a> first spotted the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/my-8-favorite-things-about-the-one-ui-8-beta">One UI 8</a> rollout for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s21-fe">Samsung Galaxy S21 FE</a>, which began Thursday, Oct. 23 for users in Thailand and Vietnam. There's no word on when the rollout will reach other areas, but this initial update release signals that One UI 8 is on the way globally for the Galaxy S21 FE. According to the report, the update is over 2GB in size — relatively small for a major OS upgrade — and comes with version <strong>G990EXXUIHYJ2</strong>.</p><p>Samsung's rollout pace appears to be quicker than usual for the Galaxy S21 FE. Like many Galaxy phone models, the Galaxy S21 FE received Android 15 later than expected. It only received the boost to One UI 7 back in May 2025. One UI 8 now quickly replaces it as the newest software version only a few months later.</p><p>To check for the update, open the <strong>Settings app</strong> on your Galaxy S21 FE and tap the <strong>Software update</strong> tab. Then, press <strong>Download and install</strong> and <strong>Install now</strong> to load up One UI 8 when it is available. If you're not in Thailand or Vietnam, expect to wait a bit for Samsung to seed the update in more regions.</p><h2 id="will-the-samsung-galaxy-s21-fe-get-any-more-updates-2">Will the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE get any more updates?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="grZX6TH96s2PbQtRJHyTVN" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S21-FE-display-sunset.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy S21 FE homescreen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/grZX6TH96s2PbQtRJHyTVN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The quick One UI 8 rollout should be welcomed by Galaxy S21 FE owners, but it may be their last major Android update. Samsung first launched the Galaxy S21 FE in January 2022 with a four-year OS update promise. One UI 8 marks the fourth full Android OS upgrade the phone has received, and the Galaxy S21 FE will turn four years old in a few months. As such, we don't expect the Galaxy S21 FE to get Android 17.</p><p>However, the phone is set to receive security updates for another year after its OS upgrade guarantee ends in January 2026. Looking ahead, newer Galaxy FE phones won't lose support as quickly. Starting with the Galaxy S24 FE and continuing with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-fe-galaxy-tab-s11-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy S25 FE</a>, these "Fan Edition" phones come with a lengthy seven-year update promise.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The company has now clarified that it plans to release GPU driver updates for the Pixel 10 lineup to improve performance.</p><p>In a statement to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-10-gpu-update-3609497/">Android Authority</a>, Google confirmed that monthly and quarterly system updates for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-series-your-ultimate-guide">Pixel 10 series</a> will continue to bring GPU improvements. The company said the September and October patch releases already contained GPU driver enhancements. "In future releases, we are planning further GPU driver updates," it told the publication.</p><p>Google switched to TSMC for the Pixel 10 series' <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-tensor-g5">Tensor G5 chipset</a>, which should have theoretically brought major improvements. While heating has reduced compared to the previous generation, the overall performance gains on the Tensor G5 aren't substantial.</p><h2 id="gpu-driver-updates-could-boost-pixel-10-s-gaming-performance-2">GPU driver updates could boost Pixel 10's gaming performance</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="qhL8MhFK6Htm5sxwCCuB3b" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-system-update-01" alt="Getting a system update on a Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qhL8MhFK6Htm5sxwCCuB3b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Some users have recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1nzjp5f/pixel_10_can_barely_handle_genshin_impact_as_gpu/">reported</a> that the Pixel 10 struggles to handle games like Genshin Impact, with noticeable lag and freezing. Thankfully, Google plans to release GPU driver updates that could deliver much-needed graphics performance improvements.</p><p>For context, the Tensor G5 chipset on the Pixel 10 uses Imagination Technologies' PowerVR DXT-48-1536 GPU, which offers up to 1.5 TFLOPS FP32 performance (on paper). However, the Pixel 10's performance still trails behind phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a>.</p><p>That's partly because the Pixel 10 ships with outdated GPU drivers. Some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1nca8ln/pixel_10_gpu_is_a_mess/">Reddit users</a> discovered that the Tensor G5 uses version 24.3 of the driver, which doesn't support Android 16.</p><p>And even though Imagination Technologies has already released version v25.1 with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/when-will-my-phone-get-android-16">Android 16</a> and Vulkan 1.4 compatibility, Google has yet to update the Pixel 10's drivers. That could explain why the Pixel 10 lags behind other flagship Android devices in gaming performance.</p><p>It's possible Google's statement about upcoming GPU driver updates refers to these newer versions, though the company hasn't provided a timeline. Unfortunately, even the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-rolls-out-bootloader-fix-in-android-16-qpr2-beta-3-1">Android 16 QPR2 Beta 3.1 update</a> doesn't include these driver updates for the Pixel 10 series, so we might have to wait a bit longer for meaningful improvements.</p> ]]></dc:content>

According to the company’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.qualcomm.com/products/mobile/snapdragon/smartphones/snapdragon-6-series-mobile-platforms/snapdragon-6s-gen-4-mobile-platform" target="_blank">product overview</a> of the chipset, the new Kryo CPU is up to 36% faster, and the Adreno GPU delivers a 59% improvement in graphics, making it a strong choice for multitaskers and mobile gamers.</p><p>This translates to smoother app launches, quicker responses, and better gameplay, all with lower power use. The platform supports 144Hz FHD+ displays. Gamers will benefit from features like Variable Rate Shading and Game Quick Touch, which improve efficiency and touch response, making <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">mid-range phones</a> feel closer to gaming flagships.</p><h2 id="pro-level-camera-support-2">Pro-level camera support</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="hWWDBi7Bh5uYB933eCub5V" name="Infinix-Note-40-Pro-Plus-5G-07.jpg" alt="Infinix Note 40 Pro Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hWWDBi7Bh5uYB933eCub5V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On the camera side, Qualcomm didn’t hold back. Like the Snapdragon 6 Gen 4 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomms-new-snapdragon-chip-is-about-to-make-mid-range-phones-way-better">unveiled earlier this year</a>, the Snapdragon 6s Gen 4 supports up to 200MP photo capture and 2K video recording, with triple image signal processors (ISP) for more versatile shooting setups. It also uses Multi-Frame Noise Reduction (MFNR) to improve clarity in low-light shots, making photos sharper and cleaner.</p><p>With the Qualcomm Spectra ISP, users get enhanced HDR, improved color accuracy, and smoother autofocus. These features were once only found in high-end devices.</p><p>Connectivity is also much better. The built-in Snapdragon X62 5G Modem-RF system works with both sub-6GHz and mmWave bands, offering download speeds up to 2.9Gbps. The chip supports Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.4. With Qualcomm AI Engine, users get smarter camera features, better voice recognition, and real-time improvements to photos and audio.</p><p>On paper, the Snapdragon 6s Gen 4 pushes the 6-series line into new territory, making advanced features that were once reserved to the top Android phones more accessible than ever. Qualcomm hasn’t confirmed which phones will debut with the chip yet, but brands like Xiaomi, Motorola, and OPPO are expected to adopt it soon.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The feature concerns uploaded images to Gemini, which users would typically do to receive information about the subject matter. However, what the tipster states is that there is the ability to "circle" or otherwise highlight a specific area on that photo for the AI.</p><p>The feature is very similar to Android's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>, which allows users to circle a screenshot and run a Search query about it. For Gemini, the tipster discovered that the AI can explain what the image is, but it also can think for itself and identify what's been circled without user input.</p><p>In the tipster's example, it seems Gemini will mention the screenshot as a whole before focusing on the content you've highlighted. The AI then gave a brief explanation of what the user selected to hopefully fulfill any questions they may have. The tipster also mentions that Gemini can lean on Google's AI image software (Nano Banana) to "remove" the highlighted/circled part of an image.</p><p>For right now, it seems we might be waiting on this feature to arrive (if it ever does). As the post points out, it's not entirely integrated in Gemini, as the menu to circle imagery is pretty barebones.</p><h2 id="one-feature-inspires-another-2">One feature inspires another</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:267px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.72%;"><img id="XdXT3qv9MSomGg7pttyj9M" name="google-gemini-circling-image-specifics" alt="A screenshot of Gemini's "circling" feature for specific portions of an image, which was reportedly spotted in development." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XdXT3qv9MSomGg7pttyj9M.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="267" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google's been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-circle-to-search-ai-overviews-expands-galaxy-s25">refining its Circle to Search experience</a> this year, which started around the time the Galaxy S25 series launched. AI Overviews made their debut on the feature, bringing quick, bite-sized briefs for users, giving them the info they need to know in a hurry. Google said AI Overviews in CtoS includes places, trending images, and more visual search queries. In short, it's much more useful now.</p><p>Circle to Search also gained "one-tap actions," meaning users can lean on it to pick up phone numbers, emails, and URLs.</p><p>Just last month, Google updated the feature again with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/circle-to-search-gains-real-time-translation">continuous real-time translation feature</a>.

There are two significant changes with this alleged Moto foldable, and both concern its external appearance. The biggest change, according to the uploaded WIPO illustrations, is the Razr's cover display, which is no longer square.</p><p>The drawings in question claim that this particular Razr foldable may not feature a squared cover display, but rather a circular one, centered, and against its right side frame.</p><p>It's difficult to discern in the imagery, but it seems that this circular cover display won't be as immersive as one would like. There appears to be a thick border (bezel, if you will) around its circumference. The next supposed change deals with the phone's camera array, which tacks on one more lens for a triple, vertical array.</p><p>It's hard to fathom Motorola switching up its design like this, especially after the traction the Razr series has gained with this large cover display (across its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">base and Ultra models</a>, too). It's worth taking such a leak like this with a grain of salt, as this may not come to pass.</p><p>However, as the publication theorizes, this design could be for an alternative, perhaps even "cheaper" Razr in the future.</p><h2 id="for-now-don-t-hold-your-breath-2">For now, don't hold your breath</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:836px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:71.77%;"><img id="6zQT7BvRjKaK9hUc8F3AjJ" name="motorola-razr-future-alleged-design-patent" alt="An alleged illustration of a potential future Motorola Razr with a circular cover display against its right side and a vertical camera array within the housing." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6zQT7BvRjKaK9hUc8F3AjJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="836" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: XpertPick)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If we walk back time a little to earlier this year, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-arrives-as-a-trio">when the 2025 Motorola Razr trio launched</a>, it'd become evident the alleged design and what we have conflict. The company revealed a Razr, Razr Plus, and Razr Ultra, each with an immersive cover display that spans the majority of its external top. It allows users to have a wide array of functions without opening their phones, like watching YouTube videos, texting, and more.</p><p>If we're chasing the more "affordable" angle with the alleged patent discovery, seeing it as an outside variant <em>could </em>be viable. The smaller, circular display wouldn't be as useful as what would be the flagship's cover, but there might be some potential there.</p><p>We'll have to see what Motorola leans toward next year, as it has been pushing and focusing on its foldables even more, advancing its hardware and AI capabilities.</p><p>On a shimmering note, Motorola's Razr 2025 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-brilliant-razr-2025-buds-loop-swarovski-collaboration-shines-launch">had a collab with Swarovski crystals</a> in August, bringing a fashion-forward, glimmering design.</p> ]]></dc:content>

These Halloween visuals are only around for a limited time, so if you want to try them out in your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-meet-fresh-ui-makeover-update">Google Meet</a> calls, you'll need to act fast.</p><p>The highlight of Meet's spooky season tools is the AI-powered makeup option. This feature uses AI to add virtual makeup to your face, giving you the look you want on Meet calls without doing it yourself. Typically, there are 12 different makeup styles available in the <strong>Appearance</strong> tab in the <strong>Backgrounds and effects</strong> menu. But for Halloween, you'll get an extra "Goth Chic" makeup option.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:512px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:47.85%;"><img id="BqJwHQacZd2AanHD5ZhqN8" name="Goth makeup" alt="The limited-time Halloween makeup effects in Google Meet." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BqJwHQacZd2AanHD5ZhqN8.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="512" height="245" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>AI-powered makeup rolled out earlier this month in Google Workspace, joining the Touch-up feature.

They're available on Google Meet for web or on the mobile app for easy access.</p><p>If you want to take the AI-powered makeup one step further for Halloween, you can use turn yourself into a mummy or zombie using a limited-time filter. Go to the <strong>Filters</strong> tab in the <strong>Backgrounds and effects</strong> menu and you'll see the exclusive options that let you become your favorite Halloween character with a full face of virtual makeup.</p><h2 id="custom-backgrounds-in-google-meet-for-spooky-season-2">Custom backgrounds in Google Meet for spooky season</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:512px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:54.49%;"><img id="fMWqAHkURWUDHSrt7E65wL" name="Halloween-genai-neon-glow" alt="The AI-generated Halloween backgrounds available in Google Meet." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fMWqAHkURWUDHSrt7E65wL.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="512" height="279" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:512px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:54.69%;"><img id="FtREbFiVe8LyL9d2ebr3wL" name="Halloween-genai-no-prompt1" alt="The AI-generated Halloween backgrounds available in Google Meet." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FtREbFiVe8LyL9d2ebr3wL.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="512" height="280" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:512px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:54.69%;"><img id="USogSzmmc9QcGwnSC3xCvL" name="Halloween-genai-made-out-of-hotdogs" alt="The AI-generated Halloween backgrounds available in Google Meet." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/USogSzmmc9QcGwnSC3xCvL.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="512" height="280" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>If you're looking for a basic option, Google Meet also sports pre-created seasonal backgrounds.

According to the publication, these cameras are stalling right out of the box, during the setup process between them and your phone. The post states that the Onn cameras are freezing on the "Activating" stage in the Home app.</p><p>It seems as though this issue is quite persistent, often failing and forcing the user to begin the setup process all over again. Users have reportedly mentioned this as a recurring problem; however, the publication identified an issue with updating the devices, which also fails.</p><p>Elsewhere, on Reddit, users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome/comments/1nzq4pj/comment/njvybuf/">on the Google Home subreddit</a> have started reporting frustrating issues beyond the initial setup stages.

They state that, in the app, all that appears is the "request contains invalid argument" (something went wrong) screen.</p><p>They state that they've "factory reset and deleted the home," but the issue persists.</p><h2 id="the-expansion-s-issues-2">The expansion's issues</h2><blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome/comments/1nzq4pj/just_got_my_onn_indoor_wired_camera">Just got my onn indoor wired camera</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome">r/googlehome</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><p>Others <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome/comments/1nzq4pj/comment/njwlyvj/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">are having difficulties</a> accessing their "24/7 recording" content. The user states they've obtained the appropriate subscription for the feature, yet it won't surface.

The first key update involves Google merging its Eart AI models with Gemini. The post states this upgrade should make it possible for researchers to "instantly find objects and discover patterns from satellite imagery." Some use cases include predicting sandstorm occurrences and even monitoring available drinking water in a given area.</p><p>However, Google states that merging Earth AI's models and Gemini will arrive first as a test for U.S. users "in the coming weeks."

Google states that its Geospatial Reasoning technology now leans on the AI model to "connect" multiple Earth AI models to answer tougher questions. Soon, researchers can combine weather forecasts, population maps, and satellite imagery to answer difficult questions with data about community vulnerabilities and disaster responses.</p><p>Similar to Gemini's "deeper insights" update for Google Earth, this Geospatial Reasoning update is headed for Google's testing grounds.

They're both powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 9500 platform, get the same storage variants, have a similar-sized 6.78-inch AMOLED panel, same ultrasonic fingerprint modules, and a big battery.</p><p>They even share the same 50MP Sony LYT-828 main camera and 50MP Samsung JN5 wide-angle modules, and a 200MP telephoto lens — albeit one that's slightly different, with the Find X9 Pro featuring the Samsung HP5 module (Vivo uses a custom HPB sensor). Heck, OPPO even has a telephoto extender this year, which is similar to what Vivo provides on the X300 Pro.</p><p>Although there are many hardware similarities, these devices aren't identical to use — far from it. Vivo and OPPO clearly diverge when it comes to their camera tuning, and that was immediately evident when I started using the Find X9 Pro. The software is refreshingly different as well, even if both phone makers chose to "borrow" iOS 26's translucent effects.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="rEnj2pkAWgFVbFbzbgbaGM" name="OPPO Find X9 Pro" alt="OPPO Find X9 Pro testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rEnj2pkAWgFVbFbzbgbaGM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Anyway, back to the cameras. OPPO is using a new Lumo camera engine, with the brand noting that it overhauled its imaging algorithms to deliver cleaner and more detailed photos. Interestingly, it's designed to shoot 50MP stills as standard, able to eke out much better quality. Video quality is improved as well, and the phone is now able to shoot 4K120 Dolby Vision footage — albeit with the main camera and tele lens (wide-angle is limited to 4K60).</p><p>Let's get to the photos. Predictably, the Find X9 Pro does a fantastic job in just about any lighting scenario, delivering detailed photos with good dynamic range and color accuracy. OPPO says it worked closely with Sony and Hasselblad to tune both the sensor and its imaging algorithms this year, and there is a noticeable difference in the resultant image quality over the Find X8 Pro.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span

This is one of the key reasons why I used the Vivo X200 Pro and Find X8 Pro so much over the course of 2025, and I'm glad to see both brands making positive strides with portrait mode on their latest devices.</p><p>Then there's the <del>telephoto extender</del> err, detachable zoom lens. OPPO went with a similar system as Vivo, but annoyingly, attaching the zoom lens covers up the entire camera island, so you can't use any other lens when it's in use. This isn't a limitation on the X300 Pro, and OPPO should consider tweaking the design with the next generation. The detachable lens does a great job extending the zoom range, and the resultant image quality is similar to that of the X300 Pro.

That's changing now, with the phone maker confirming that it will use a 1.5K BOE display on the device.</p><p>At an initial glance, that may seem like a downgrade from the 2K panel used on the OnePlus 13, but OnePlus' Li Jie Louis <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/ttarticle/p/show?id=2309405222115321446526">took to Weibo</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gadgets360.com/mobiles/news/oneplus-15-display-resolution-downgrade-reason-specifications-features-9502611">Gadgets 360</a>) to clarify a few things. Basically, OnePlus wanted to increase the refresh rate to 165Hz on the phone, and that wasn't possible with a 2K panel. So instead of going with the standard 120Hz display, OnePlus chose to "upgrade" the panel.</p><p>The display is still made by BOE, and it should get the usual extras that have been a mainstay on OnePlus phones these last two years, including DC dimming and good color vibrancy. Although the panel resolution is lower, Louis indicated that the display is costlier this time.</p><p>Honestly, this isn't an issue. Having used the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">best OnePlus phones</a>, I can't tell the difference between a 2K and 1.5K panel in regular use, and I like that the phone maker is instead offering higher refresh — that's something you can actually notice. In a similar vein, the phone has thinner bezels this time, and goes down to 1nit at night; these are tangible gains that make a difference in regular use.</p><p>Also, while OnePlus says this was done to switch to 165Hz, the real reason might have to do with its BBK siblings. Both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x300-pro-review">Vivo X300 Pro </a>and Find X9 Pro use 1.5K panels as well, and at the X300 launch event in Shanghai, Vivo talked extensively about how it partnered with BOE to set up a production line catered to its devices.</p><p>This is just conjecture on my part, but I believe the Find X9 Pro and the OnePlus 15 use a similar panel, and it wouldn't have been feasible to switch to a 2K resolution just for one device — which doesn't sell anywhere as much as its OPPO and Vivo siblings.</p><p>Anyway, the result is that the OnePlus 15 will have a 1.5K panel, and it shouldn't be an issue. If anything, it may even have better battery life on account of not having to drive quite as many pixels, and I'll take that any day over infinitesimal gains in resolution.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The company states that this new AI button will appear at the top of search results when users are looking for a new smartwatch, clothes, or anything. "Help me decide" gets specific, offering its assistance when users are searching for similar products to their initial search, but haven't made a purchase.</p><p>The post adds that "help me decide" leverages Amazon's LLMs and AWS services "to understand what you need and why by looking at your shopping history and preferences." The AI does a little more work by surfacing the product's details to help inform your decision and digging through customer reviews to further that research.</p><p>When searching for products, users will notice a "help me decide" button at the top right of the results with golden stars. After tapping the button, the AI will run through its processes and finally deliver its result: a singular product recommendation. The AI will surface the product's image, name, rating, price, a brief description from the product's creator, and its AI-compiled "Customers say" box.</p><p>This is what's known as a "Top Pick" within the AI's new feature. However, if you're unsatisfied, Amazon states you can tap two other options: Budget Pick and Upgrade Pick, to see what else is possible.</p><h2 id="amazon-continues-to-bring-speed-with-ai-2">Amazon continues to bring speed with AI</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="bwJU9Lf68VefG7cbDVk5iA" name="amazon-help-me-decide-top-pick" alt="Amazon's new AI feature, "help me decide," will connect users with products that they may be interested in, producing its image, title, rating, price, and more." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bwJU9Lf68VefG7cbDVk5iA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Amazon)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Amazon states "help me decide" is now available for users on Android and iOS in the app, as well as those shopping in mobile browsers. It states you can check if you have the feature by heading into "Keep shopping for" at the top of the app.</p><p>This feature is in a similar vein <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/amazon/amazon-buy-for-me-ai-agentic-test-start">to a test Amazon ran</a> earlier this spring. The company rolled out an AI test called "Buy for me," which allowed users to grant permission to the AI to purchase a product for them, without much manual input. It arrived for a limited group of U.S. testers and appeared when searching for products in the app. In short, tapping "buy for me" would let the AI immediately run through the usual payment processes, such as name, address, and card information.</p><p>It was an agentic test that leveraged Amazon's Bedrock AI software to handle everything for the user.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Laser Dance is exactly what you need, and it's debuting on the Meta Quest 3 and Quest 3S <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/laser-dance/7209598115800315/">this November in early access</a>.</p><p>In Laser Dance, the Meta Quest's brilliant color passthrough cameras turn any ordinary living room — or any room, really — into a laser-filled obstacle course that you'll have to dodge, weave, duck, and maybe even jump over to get to the shiny red button at the end.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iGaxfysGYXJV3Se2Ecn8Ab" name="laser-dance-mixed-reality-gameplay" alt="Mixed reality gameplay of Laser Dance on the Meta Quest 3S" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iGaxfysGYXJV3Se2Ecn8Ab.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="400" height="225" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Vanbo BV)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Any old room will work for the process, which begins with you placing one button on each "end" of the room. Buttons have to be at least 10ft/3m apart, but the trick is that you just need to walk that distance. It doesn't have to be a straight line.</p><p>I asked developer Thomas Van Bouwel about it, and he told me, "So, e.g., if you have a master bedroom with two nightstands, putting the buttons on the two nightstands and walking around the bed is valid." Remember, since the Meta Quest is a wireless VR console, you don't have any wires or cords to trip over, so you can go ham with the playspace size and shape.</p><p>The action begins fairly simply, with the first few levels involving static lasers that stay in one place, making it easy to get into character and slink your way around each laser to get to the end. As you can tell from the video above, those lasers don't stay in place for long, becoming much more like a traditional video game as you progress.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CJu9LkE6PVENDcVGSeumme" name="LaserDance_Screenshot_04" alt="Mixed reality gameplay of a man dodging laser in Laser Dance while wearing a Meta Quest 3S headset" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CJu9LkE6PVENDcVGSeumme.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Vanbo BV)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I've had access to the game for a few days now and can call it another huge win for Vanbo games.

This might be called "early access," but it's got over 18 levels to play, all of which scale with your room size and shape and has over 80 laser patterns. That ensures even the same levels feel different when you play them in another room or home!</p><p>And if you've got some accessibility needs, don't worry, the game caters to a wide variety of players with significant adjustments where you might need them.

This means that AI will become the primary feature on a phone, pulling information from apps to give users a more intuitive and personalized experience.</p><p>Much like how you can ask <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/gemini-live-pixel-9-pro-grocery-list">Gemini</a> to summarize the recent emails from your manager about the 'Q4 marketing campaign' and add a task to your to-do list to draft a follow-up presentation for next week, Gemini will pretty much accomplish these tasks without much of your intervention. But this is still Gemini interacting with Google's apps. Now imagine if it could do the same with the rest of the apps on your phone?</p><p>In the future, AI will essentially function as the brain of your phone, with apps serving as its neurons, all working together to help you accomplish tasks. For instance, you could say, "Hey Google, could you plan my dinner for tonight, send me a shopping list of ingredients, and then book an Uber for 5 pm so I can get supplies right after my Pilates class?" and then simply observe as everything falls into place.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/euRgJMKNN78" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/exclusive-how-ai-will-transform-our-relationship-with-technology">IDC experts told Android Central in an exclusive report</a> that the existing App ecosystem will be forced to adapt. But if these models do change, how will AI determine which specific app to use for a given task? For example, if apps like Expedia or Airbnb are not installed, will the AI prioritize an app based on user history, performance, or a paid partnership? Here's what could likely happen.</p><p>"Strategic partnerships between service providers, phone makers, and AI platforms are likely to be formed, and we can expect this kind of integration to become more common over the next five years as AI matures and becomes ubiquitous across devices," IDC notes.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yrkDUTqnrTUEAknS32XnEC" name="Gemini-Top-Free-App-iOS" alt="Gemini listed as the top iOS app with a Pixel in the background." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yrkDUTqnrTUEAknS32XnEC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>App developers and companies may not like the idea of losing autonomy over their products. "Many will resist handing over control to AI platforms, fearing the loss of direct engagement and brand identity, and will try to maintain their own ecosystems and monetization strategies over the next few years," the firm added.</p><p>Ultimately, businesses that effectively use AI will thrive because people these days want things to happen quickly and on the go. And those who resist this change might be caught in an uphill battle. This switch in the overall business model could also let AI act as a filter, and could potentially change the need for users to interact with these apps directly.</p> ]]></dc:content>

These Bluetooth dongles bypass your device’s built-in Bluetooth chips to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bluetooth-audio-terms-codecs-explained">transmit the best audio</a> to your Bluetooth earbuds, headphones, or IEMs. That’s it. If you’re up on computer lingo, think of these transmitters as external “sound cards.”</p><p>I’ve been switching between the two dongles for a couple of weeks now, testing them with mobile devices, as well as a Surface Pro 11 and an iMac Pro. With a quirk here and there, I’ve found that they deliver on the promise of providing plug-and-play experiences.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="sZzdjSnk5We94dECLCocKF" name="btd-700-qcc-dongle-pro-surface-pro-btd700.JPG" alt="Sennheiser BTD 700 connected to a Microsoft Surface Pro 11" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sZzdjSnk5We94dECLCocKF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With each device, you get the transmitter in the box, along with a USB-A to Type-C adapter, allowing you to use it with a laptop, computer, or gaming device that doesn’t have USB-C ports. Other than documentation, that’s it. I’ve plugged both dongles into phones with cases on them, without any fit issues.</p><p>Each unit has a single status LED. For the BTD 700, take a picture of the menu page showing the LED status legend and save it to a folder in your gallery, since it doesn’t come with a smartphone or tablet companion app. It is quite easy to operate, though, as you simply need to press the button at the bottom of the dongle to change modes/codecs.</p><p>The QCC Dongle Pro has a mobile app, making it much easier to know which Bluetooth codec you’re using.

You’ll need to look at the app for that.</p><p>Since the Sennheiser BTD 700 doesn't have a mobile app for pairing, you’ll have to put the dongle and listening device into pairing mode and just wait for them to connect.</p><p>The other thing to note is that almost any time you plug something into a smartphone or tablet's USB-C port other than a charging cable, you’re going to drain the battery faster. In this case, around 10% per hour. Keep that in mind for any long-haul travel, music, or movie-watching sessions.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="U9wZqAW8VbQQM5p6gYepRF" name="btd-700-qcc-dongle-pro-qcc-pixel9-led.JPG" alt="Questyle QCC Dongle Pro connected to a Google Pixel 9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U9wZqAW8VbQQM5p6gYepRF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Still, you really can't go wrong with either.

It has one of the best camera packages of the year, and only the China-exclusive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x200-ultra-review">X200 Ultra</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/oppo-find-x8-ultra-review">Find X8 Ultra</a> did any better in this area. And while Funtouch OS gets a lot of criticism, I prefer it to ColorOS, so that wasn't an issue.</p><p>With the X300 Pro, Vivo isn't changing the fundamentals. The design is roughly the same, it doesn't feel any different in daily use, and if you're in Asia, you get a bigger 6,510mAh battery that should last two days between charges. The cameras get a predictable boost, and they manage to take better photos and videos than the X200 Pro, which is all the reason I need to switch to the X300 Pro as my daily driver going forward.</p><p>Oh, and Vivo is bringing the device to western markets, which is a definite positive. Do the upgrades allow the X300 Pro to stand out against its Chinese rivals? I believe so — I used the phone for just over ten days, and this is the best all-round camera available today.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-vivo-x300-pro-pricing-and-availability"><span>Vivo X300 Pro: Pricing and availability</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="BeXjqo5i9P5bJ9QHRkfVJm" name="Vivo X300 Pro" alt="Vivo X300 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BeXjqo5i9P5bJ9QHRkfVJm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Vivo unveiled the X300 and X300 Pro at a launch event in Shanghai, China on October 13, with both phones on sale in the country. The global debut is slated for October 30, which is when the X300 and X300 Pro will start being available in Spain, Austria, Germany, Hungary, and other western markets in addition to key regions in Southeast Asia.</p><p>India is a huge market for the brand, and Vivo indicated that it is mulling a launch in the country at the end of November or December. I'll update once I have global pricing details, but for now, the X300 starts at CNY 4,399 ($617) in China, going up to CNY 5,799 ($814) for the 1TB configuration.</p><p>The X300 Pro starts at CNY 5,299 ($744) for the 12GB/256GB model, CNY 5,999 ($843) for the 16GB/512GB edition, and CNY 6,699 ($940) for the 16GB/1TB model. There's also a Photography Kit that's bundled with the phone this time, and it is identical to what we got on the X200 Ultra earlier this year. This model costs CNY 8,299 ($1,166), and is the only one that gets satellite connectivity.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Vivo X300 Pro</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.78-inch LTPO AMOLED, 120Hz, 2800x1260, Dolby Vision, 4500 nits max</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>OriginOS 6 based on Android 16</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Chipset</p></td><td  ><p>MediaTek Dimensity 9500, 1 x 4.21 GHz C1-Ultra, 3 x 3.5 GHz C1-Premium, 4 x 2.7 GHz C1-Pro, G1-Ultra, 3nm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>12GB/16GB LPDDR5X</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB/512GB/1TB UFS 4.1</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear camera 1</p></td><td  ><p>50MP 1/1.28-inch f/1.6 Sony Lytia LYT-828, 24mm, 4K120 Dolby Vision video, OIS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear camera 2</p></td><td  ><p>200MP 1/1.4-inch f/2.7 Samsung HPB telephoto, 85mm, 3.7x optical zoom, OIS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear camera 3</p></td><td  ><p>50MP 1/12.76-inch f/2.0 Samsung JN1, 15mm wide-angle lens</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Front camera</p></td><td  ><p>50MP Samsung JN1</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ingress protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP68 and IP69 dust and water resistance</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4 global 5G bands, NFC, dual-band GPS, satellite connectivity (1TB model)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Security</p></td><td  ><p>Ultrasonic in-screen sensor</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Audio</p></td><td  ><p>USB-C, stereo sound, 24-bit/192kHz, AptX HD, AptX Adaptive, AptX Lossless</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>6,510mAh silicon battery (5,440mAh in select regions), 90W charging, 40W wireless charging</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>161.2 x 75.5 x 8mm, 226g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Brown, White, Black, Blue</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-vivo-x300-pro-design"><span>Vivo X300 Pro: Design</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5159px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="5NXMuxhFgfV4uPGEFpQwLm" name="Vivo X300 Pro" alt="Vivo X300 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5NXMuxhFgfV4uPGEFpQwLm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5159" height="2906" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/i-used-the-vivo-x300-and-x300-pro">noted in my X300 Pro hands-on</a>, Vivo didn't change the design too much. I see this as a good thing, as it ensures design consistency between generations — something OPPO needs to look into. Essentially, you still get a slab of a phone with a giant camera island at the back, but it's a little easier to hold and use, and after a half-dozen tumbles (my 2-year-old decided to throw the phone around), the glass panes at the front and rear soak up a lot of damage without breaking.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="XCjyoKFg4K4ovpdhnuj4Gm" name="Vivo X300 Pro" alt="Vivo X300 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XCjyoKFg4K4ovpdhnuj4Gm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Of course, there are small niceties; the mid-frame and rear glass have a matte texture this time, and this makes a big difference in usability.

While that isn't evident immediately, I noticed a difference in extended gaming sessions.</p><p>I'm using the 16GB/512GB edition of the phone, and I think this is the variant to get if you're eyeing the device. All models get LPDDR5X memory and UFS 4.1 storage modules, and I didn't see any problems with connectivity. There's good news on that side of things, with Vivo finally adding eSIM integration to the phone globally; this made an immediate difference as I was able to set up and use an eSIM while attending the phone's launch in China.</p><p>Otherwise, there were no issues making calls, connecting to my home network, or pairing a myriad of devices over Bluetooth. The vibration motor has even better feedback this year, and it's much better to use than the module on my Pixel 10 Pro XL.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-vivo-x300-pro-battery-life"><span>Vivo X300 Pro: Battery life</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="kDZDmgmRmayxrHwxDZh3Em" name="Vivo X300 Pro" alt="Vivo X300 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kDZDmgmRmayxrHwxDZh3Em.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Like other Chinese phone makers, Vivo embraced silicon battery tech last year, and the X300 Pro builds on this foundation. The phone gets a 6,510mAh battery that's designed to last two days. There's just one problem — the variant I'm using has a smaller 5,440mAh battery instead.</p><p>While the rest of the hardware is unchanged, Vivo is using a smaller battery in the Austrian, German, and Hungarian models of the X300 Pro, and while I usually get the Asian unit of the device, I received the Austrian variant this time. Don't get me wrong; this phone lasts all day as well, but it doesn't measure up to the X200 Pro when it comes to battery longevity, and doesn't have the two-day battery that the Asian model gets.</p><p>That's annoying to say the least, and in my use, there were two days when I had to plug it in before turning in. Thankfully, it doesn't take too long to charge the phone thanks to 90W charging tech, and it even gets 50W USB PD charging, which is just easier. The downside is that there's no charger in the box; again, this isn't an issue everywhere, but the Austrian model doesn't have one. Vivo still provides a charger in Asia with the X300 and X300 Pro.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-vivo-x300-pro-cameras"><span>Vivo X300 Pro: Cameras</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="YuEVbeZBBQ82aeCn8Q4iBm" name="Vivo X300 Pro" alt="Vivo X300 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YuEVbeZBBQ82aeCn8Q4iBm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Similar to what Vivo did with MediaTek, the brand collaborated with Sony and Samsung over the imaging modules on the X300 Pro. The phone gets the brand-new 50MP Sony Lytia LYT-828, and a new 200MP telephoto lens that uses the highly customized Samsung HPB. Vivo didn't change the wide-angle lens, so you still get the same Samsung JN1, and this is what's being used at the front as well.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="5wn7QbDVa2VEuustKdmwNm" name="Vivo X300 Pro" alt="Vivo X300 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5wn7QbDVa2VEuustKdmwNm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What's noteworthy is Vivo bringing the telephoto extender to the phone, making it that much more versatile. The accessory makes a huge difference, and while it isn't the easiest to use, it is a differentiator if you're an enthusiast.</p><p>The device excels at photos, and Vivo lavished plenty of attention towards video recording as well. The X300 Pro is able to shoot 4K120 Dolby Vision footage, and video quality is noticeably better than previous years. The interface itself hasn't changed much, and you still get shooting modes at the bottom, along with all the toggles and effects. On that note, Zeiss integration is intact, and you get to choose between various modes — I went with Vivid.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap"

takes better photos than just about any other device I tested this year. Yes, the X200 Ultra technically does a better job, but the X300 Pro holds its own, and honestly, I prefer the latter. The wide-angle lens is decent enough in its own right, and the tele module is fantastic this year — it takes detailed shots at 10x without any hassle, and I got usable photos at 30x.</p><p>In short, the X300 Pro is my recommendation if you need the best cameras available today.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-vivo-x300-pro-software"><span>Vivo X300 Pro: Software</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="odxc4x6cqRAsFtXsunntYm" name="Vivo X300 Pro" alt="Vivo X300 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/odxc4x6cqRAsFtXsunntYm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The X300 Pro sees the debut of OriginOS 6 globally, and it is based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-review">Android 16</a>. The software has a much more modern design, and it is a clear upgrade from Funtouch OS. What irks me a little is the similarities to iOS 26; the translucent effects and other design elements are heavily borrowed from the iPhone, and Vivo isn't the only brand doing this — all other Chinese phone makers are going this route.</p><p>There's no arguing that the software feels better to use on the X300 Pro. There's better uniformity to the UI as a whole, and Vivo did a good job with the smooth animations and transitions; they make interacting with the interface that much more enjoyable.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="tcCvNCVZTUj29yAHYBrCUm" name="Vivo X300 Pro" alt="Vivo X300 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tcCvNCVZTUj29yAHYBrCUm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>But as with every new redesign, there are issues; pressing down on a suggested action in the notification pane pulls up the app instead, and I noticed errant crashes. These kinds of issues usually get addressed, and the kinks should be ironed out by the time the phone becomes available globally.</p><p>Like other brands, Vivo is switching to a split notification pane, but you thankfully get the ability to switch to the older unified option. The pane itself is a clear downgrade from the one on Funtouch OS; pulling down on a notification card doesn't expand it automatically, and you have to use the arrow to do so. Similar notifications are now stacked — just like iOS — and it's just as annoying here as on my iPhone.</p><p>There's good customizability as well, and Vivo essentially "emulated" what you get on iOS. You can set up the phone to look like a clone of an iPhone, and it's clear that this was an intentional move by the brand. I still don't get the allure of trying to mimic iOS — I'd much prefer if brands went all-in on Material You aesthetic instead — but it's evident that all Chinese phone makers just want to make their phones feel like iPhones again.</p><p>Coming to updates, Vivo guarantees four years of Android OS updates, which is on the lower end of the scale as these things go. But like its BBK siblings, it's unlikely Vivo will budge on this front, and the result is that the X300 Pro lags behind Google and Samsung devices when it comes to software updates.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-vivo-x300-pro-the-alternatives"><span>Vivo X300 Pro: The alternatives</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4911px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="FApPDYXvSSvCAod9WBcERm" name="Vivo X300 Pro" alt="Vivo X300 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FApPDYXvSSvCAod9WBcERm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4911" height="2766" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Find X9 Pro is slated to make its global debut soon, with that device being the obvious alternative to the X300 Pro.

With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-one-year-later">Pixel Watch 3</a>, Google finally listened to what the people wanted and introduced a larger 45mm option in addition to the petite 41mm size. Naturally, the Pixel Watch 4 continued the tradition, so it too comes in 41mm and 45mm sizes.</p><p>Since the very first Pixel Watch, Google has always used the same proprietary connector for its bands. Although I was very disappointed with this decision initially, I am not as angry with this decision anymore. Sure, it would have been nice to have a universal connector like the quick-release pins that almost every other smartwatch in the world uses. But now that we're a few generations in, there are plenty of Pixel Watch bands to choose from, even if they use a different connector. That was my main source of frustration; the connector is perfectly functional otherwise.</p><p>Every single Pixel Watch band can be used on every single Pixel Watch model, as long as you have the 41mm size. If you opted for the larger 45mm size on your Pixel Watch 3 or Watch 4, then you can only use the 45mm bands made for both watches on either model. I still have my original Pixel Watch Active Band in Hazel, and it fits the 41mm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4-early-impressions">Pixel Watch 4</a> perfectly.</p><p>Don't get me wrong, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/third-pixel-watch-still-doesnt-have-good-third-party-bands">third-party options still pale</a> in comparison to alternatives like the Galaxy Watch 8 or the Amazfit Balance 2, but Google has since expanded its own range of Pixel Watch bands considerably. Then there are brands like Spigen, which offer decent, affordable straps that fit the Pixel Watch connector well. I myself use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Designed-Google-Pixel-Watch/dp/B0C91HRWZN/">Spigen Lite Fit</a> stretchy nylon band on a daily basis. For formals, metal bands like the link, mesh, or slim ones from Google are excellent options.</p><p>So if you're using the Pixel Watch 4, there are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/watch-bands/best-google-pixel-watch-4-bands">plenty of diverse watch bands</a> that you can buy, including straps made of fabric, metal, and fluoroelastomer.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="57abfd46-68d4-4f29-a2aa-86fb5be2a9e4">            <a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/watch_band_metal_link" data-model-name="Google Pixel Watch Metal Links Band" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/H6AocMdqKZMqceKZiX8wQN.jpg' alt="Google Pixel Watch Metal Links Band"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel Watch Metal Links Band</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Time for an upgrade</strong></em></p><p>The Google Pixel Watch Metal Links Band is a timeless metal links band that immediately smartens up your Pixel Watch 4.

According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/exclusive-how-ai-will-transform-our-relationship-with-technology">recent report by IDC</a>, this changed only two years ago when GenAI began appearing in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">premium smartphones</a>.

GenAI brought AI to the forefront, but its reach was limited.</p><p>IDC further notes that in a span of a few years, users will be able to interact with the same personalized AI (be it Gemini, Perplexity, and more) across smart glasses, wearables, and ambient devices. This will basically allow GenAI to pick the device that is most suited for the task at hand, for instance, if you have to move seamlessly from your phone to your headphones or car dashboard.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5xQRmeR59cPHuA8WR5yMt9" name="Android-Auto-Gemini-Live" alt="Gemini Live and Google Maps on Android Auto" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5xQRmeR59cPHuA8WR5yMt9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Devices like AI-powered smart glasses are also contributing to this shift, offering hands-free, real-time assistance, as they can basically see and hear everything the user does.

Each phone has its own unique dimensions, so you can't use any of the cases meant for a single model with another interchangeably.</p><p>It's understandable why a lot of people might wonder whether they can use their Pixel 9 Pro Fold case on the latest Pixel foldable. After all, they seem to share identical sizes and have the same dual-camera bars. However, Google tweaked the measurements a tad with the newest Pixel Fold iteration. Subtle changes in the camera bar placement and size, as well as the entire foldable phone itself, make it impossible to reuse last-gen cases on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></th><th  ><p>Pixel 10 Pro Fold</p></th><th  ><p>Pixel 9 Pro Fold</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Folded</p></td><td  ><p>155.2 x 76.3 x 10.8 mm</p></td><td  ><p>155.2 x 77.1 x 10.5 mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Unfolded</p></td><td  ><p>155.2 x 150.4 x 5.2 mm</p></td><td  ><p>155.2 x 150.2 x 5.1 mm</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1mw7ol1/pixel_9_pro_case_fit_the_pixel_10/">Reddit users have reported</a> that they were able to use Pixel 9 Pro Fold cases on their Pixel 10 Pro Fold units, but the fit isn't perfect. The camera bar and speaker alignments are off. This affects the drop-proofing added by a phone case, defeating the purpose of using a phone case in the first place.</p><p>Purchasing a case along with your new phone is the best way to go, but sometimes shipments don't arrive in time. Thus, you should only resort to using an incompatible case as a temporary solution while you wait for your Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold case to be delivered.</p><p>Poor fit and lack of impact resistance aside, another issue with using a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9-pro-fold-cases">Pixel 9 Pro Fold case</a> is that you miss out on Pixelsnap compatibility.

The company has announced that it's testing AI-powered smart glasses specifically developed for its delivery associates.</p><p>In a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/transportation/smart-glasses-amazon-delivery-drivers?ref=uploadvr.com&tag=upload01-20">blog post</a>, Amazon revealed that these glasses, unlike the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-gen-2-hands-on-impressions">Ray-Ban Meta glasses</a> that are for all users, are designed to support delivery associates to make deliveries "safer and more seamless." According to Amazon, they allow associates to scan packages, follow turn-by-turn walking directions, and capture proof of delivery — all without using their phones.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">smart glasses</a> are equipped with cameras, computer vision, and AI-powered sensing capabilities. The feature has a fixed green monochrome heads-up display that shows the package details to the delivery associate directly in their field of view.</p><h2 id="amazon-s-ai-glasses-aim-to-ease-delivery-work-2">Amazon's AI glasses aim to ease delivery work</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TnJy4t4BzU4R7s9kTWAVhU" name="amazon-smart-delivery-glasses" alt="Amazon's AI smart glasses for Delivery Associates" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TnJy4t4BzU4R7s9kTWAVhU.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Amazon)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When a delivery driver parks, the glasses automatically activate and display package details, helping them locate the correct parcel in their vehicles to the corresponding homes. After that, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/level-up-your-tech-game-with-20-percent-off-these-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses">smart glasses</a> then show turn-by-turn navigation to guide the delivery partner to the exact location.</p><p>The glasses are operated by a small controller worn in the delivery vest and powered by a swappable battery for "all-day use." Amazon also says the glasses support prescription lenses and ones that automatically adjust to surrounding light.</p><p>The company adds that it has tested earlier versions of the smart glasses with delivery partners to collect crucial feedback and improve the design. It also mentioned that a "future version" may detect issues — such as if a package is dropped at the wrong doorstep — and even notify the partner if there's a pet in the yard.</p><p>For now, Amazon hasn't revealed when it will fully deploy these smart glasses across its delivery fleet, but a previous report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/amazon-reportedly-working-on-echo-hud-glasses/">The Information</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/amazon-building-hud-glasses-for-delivery-drivers/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=threads">UploadVR</a>) suggested that Amazon plans to roll out driver glasses by mid-2026, with an initial production of about 100,000 units.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Make sure to <a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=androidcentral.com"><strong>set Android Central as a preferred source</strong></a> in Google Search, and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should"><strong>find out why you should</strong></a> so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>If you've ever lost a Pixel Bud or noticed one earbud or the charging case acting up, you know how tedious it can be to get a replacement. Google is finally making that process easier by selling replacement earbuds, eartips, and charging cases for the Pixel Buds directly through its online store.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/10/22/pixel-buds-2a-pro-2-replacement/">9to5Google</a>, the Google Store now lists replacement parts for the Pixel Buds Pro 2 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-buds-2a-announced">Pixel Buds 2a</a>. That means if you misplace one earbud, drop it in water, or your case starts malfunctioning, you can now buy those specific parts directly from Google without having to go through support.</p><p>Previously, users had to go through a lengthy self-service repair process on Google's website to order replacement parts, which often took days and involved multiple steps. Now, you can simply go to the online store, choose the part you need, and buy it straight away.</p><p>For the Pixel Buds Pro 2, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.google.com/product/replacement_pixel_buds_pro_2_earbuds?hl=en-US">replacement earbuds</a> cost $70, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.google.com/product/replacement_pixel_buds_pro_2_case?hl=en-US">charging case</a> costs $95. They're available in Porcelain, Hazel, Wintergreen, and Peony, though the new Moonstone color is currently unavailable. For the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-buds-2a-announced">Pixel Buds 2a</a>, both the earbuds and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.google.com/product/replacement_pixel_buds_2a_case?hl=en-US">case</a> cost $55 each, while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.google.com/product/replacement_pixel_buds_2a_eartip_set?hl=en-US">replacement eartips</a> for both earbuds are priced at $20.</p><h2 id="replacement-parts-are-now-just-a-click-away-2">Replacement parts are now just a click away</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8cuHCkWQym8z8oUxEvr6WQ" name="pixel-buds-replacement-parts" alt="Replacement Pixel Buds 2a and Pixel Buds Pro 2 parts on Google Store" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8cuHCkWQym8z8oUxEvr6WQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google notes that replacements may not always be available in all regions or at all times. At the time of writing, eartips for the Pixel Buds 2a are already out of stock. It's worth noting that at the time of purchasing, you can also specify whether you want the left or right earbud replaced.</p><p>This move aligns with Google's growing emphasis on repairability and sustainability across its product lineup. The company recently highlighted that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-series-your-ultimate-guide">Pixel 10 series</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Pixel Watch 4</a> are easier to repair than ever before and even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/get-pixel-repaired-half-price-oct-2025">hosted a repair education session</a> at its New York store last week to promote the effort.</p><p>With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-2a-review">Pixel Buds 2a</a>, Google has also made it possible to replace the charging case battery, something that wasn't possible with the previous generation Pixel Buds. And now, replacement parts are available for the rest of the earbuds too — though you might want to wait for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/black-friday">Black Friday</a>, where a full pair of Pixel Buds might cost nearly the same as these replacement parts.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Now, leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5224477353054299" target="_blank">Ice Universe on Weibo</a> (translated) says "the release of the Samsung Galaxy S26 series has been postponed." There are no other details in the post explaining a potential cause for the holdups, or when the lineup might now release.</p><p>The post, first shared on Tuesday, Oct. 22, came just minutes after the leaker Instant Digital also shared news of the rumored Galaxy S26 delay <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5224475520925890" target="_blank">on Weibo</a> (translated): "In order to present it better to everyone, the release of the Galaxy S26 series may be postponed to March for release."</p><p>As the Galaxy S26 is still in the rumor phase and Samsung hasn't confirmed anything yet, we don't officially know when its next lineup of flagship phones might release. The Samsung Galaxy S25 was announced in January 2025 and became generally available for purchase the following month. If these two leakers' claims about a Galaxy S26 delay pan out, we could be looking at a February 2026 or March 2026 launch.</p><h2 id="it-s-not-the-first-rumor-alleging-a-galaxy-s26-shakeup-2">It's not the first rumor alleging a Galaxy S26 shakeup</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Sbmar9v2hHx2DxaATYpNyT" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Ultra-S25-Plus-and-S25-back-03" alt="Comparing the sizes and shapes of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus, and Samsung Galaxy S25" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Sbmar9v2hHx2DxaATYpNyT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If the Samsung Galaxy S26 series ends up being delayed, we likely won't know the root cause for certain. However, other rumors related to the Samsung launch seem to paint the picture that things aren't going as planned. The company was tipped to be prepping a lineup including the Galaxy S26 Pro, Galaxy S26 Edge, and Galaxy S26 Ultra.</p><p>With a few months to go before the phones' expected launch window, the rumors have completely flipped. Samsung is now thought to be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-galaxy-s26-edge-dead-before-launch">canceling the Galaxy S26 Edge entirely</a> in favor of the Galaxy S26 Plus. Soon after, leaks rolled in claiming the Galaxy S26 Pro would not be branded as "Pro," and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/-may-not-be-an-s26-pro-either">instead stick to basics as the Galaxy S26</a>.</p><p>With key details reportedly up in the air, it might not come as a surprise that Samsung is rumored to be delaying the Galaxy S26 launch. Still, we'll have to wait and see whether these rumors turn out to be true.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The upgrade is seemingly designed to give the Pixel's AOD a little more smarts when it comes to whether or not the user is around to interact with it.</p><p>Rahman states that the newest Canary build features a new string with the following on-device description: "power down the display when no user activity is detected to save power."</p><p>As Rahman reiterates, Google Pixels already turn off the AOD if your phone is in your pocket or if flipped over (screen down). What "activity" could mean in this case could involve a couple of things. As Rahman mentions, perhaps the Pixel's proximity sensor could come into greater effect here, to determine if the user is near their phone and moving around, or whatever the case may be. Moreover, tracking the user's "activity" could also mean whether or not they've picked up their device to check a notification or not in a while.</p><p>There's no hiding the fact that the AOD can severely drain your battery, which is why Google is supposedly working on this new option. If users left the room, but left their Pixel's AOD on for a while, it'll shut off, saving them from returning to a nearly dead phone.</p><h2 id="refining-the-pixel-2">Refining the Pixel</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xoYNUpVZSvwfBKGUhj8XwU" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-white-back-11" alt="A white Google Pixel 10 Pro XL on a latticework black chair" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xoYNUpVZSvwfBKGUhj8XwU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google revealed its Android Canary channel during the summer, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-android-canary-release-channel-devs-rigorous-testing-pixels">as an avenue for developers</a> to step into the core of its API development. Essentially, developers can test extremely early versions of Android to provide feedback and to see what new features are coming in future updates. While it's similar to the Chrome Canary channel, Google doesn't update its Android nearly as often.</p><p>Those involved see new content once every month.</p><p>What users can likely step into more frequently is Google's Android 16 tests, which recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-qpr2-beta-3-changes">moved into QPR2 Beta 3</a>.

Interestingly, you get two cameras at the back — a 50MP main lens and 8MP wide-angle — and as a result, the rear camera module is bigger than most other tablets.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="mMTGmuKgDXgeVdWsQ9b53N" name="Huawei MatePad Pro 12.2 2025" alt="Huawei MatePad Pro 12.2 2025 on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mMTGmuKgDXgeVdWsQ9b53N.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A tablet needs good accessories, and the reason why I'm now using the Xiaomi Pad Mini to control my smart home is because of the custom case and stylus. Huawei does a great job in this area, and the MatePad Pro 12.2-inch comes with a keyboard and stylus as standard. The Glide Keyboard connects using Huawei's NearLink protocol, and it has a cubby to store the stylus. On that note, Huawei doesn't bundle the M-Pencil 3 stylus, but sells it as a free add-on when you buy the tablet.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5076px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="EBSUXipKVVpq9Jib2XD2wM" name="Huawei MatePad Pro 12.2 2025" alt="Huawei MatePad Pro 12.2 2025 on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EBSUXipKVVpq9Jib2XD2wM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5076" height="2859" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The keyboard is great to use; the keys have good travel, you get a large touchpad, and it doesn't add much bulk to the tablet as a whole.

While there isn't a charger bundled with the tablet, it uses Huawei's 100W standard, and it takes just over an hour to charge the battery.</p><h2 id="no-google-no-problem-2">No Google, no problem</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="gWBQ85E8y4aYtzenQ2yULN" name="Huawei MatePad Pro 12.2 2025" alt="Huawei MatePad Pro 12.2 2025 on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gWBQ85E8y4aYtzenQ2yULN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's the software where things diverge from traditional Android tablets. The MatePad Pro doesn't have Google Mobile Services, so you don't get the Play Store, Gmail, Chrome, or YouTube pre-installed. While that is annoying, it's extremely easy to get these apps installed via GBox — doing so takes under five minutes. Once they're installed, they're sandboxed within GBox, but I didn't see any difference in usability.</p><p>The tablet runs HarmonyOS 4.3 out of the box, and it is similar enough to EMUI that there isn't a learning curve. If anything, the software is nearly identical to what Honor has on its tablets — make of that what you will. The upside is that it isn't limiting in any way, and that's good to see.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="guGiwrUnPE6dV3B5o77h4N" name="Huawei MatePad Pro 12.2 2025" alt="Huawei MatePad Pro 12.2 2025 on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/guGiwrUnPE6dV3B5o77h4N.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Ultimately, the MatePad Pro 12.2-inch has everything I need in an Android tablet, and the tandem OLED with the matte texture is an absolute joy to use — it's the reason why I used the tablet instead of other Android rivals.

Rolling out today, users can "set a daily limit" for how long the YouTube app on mobile will allow them to scroll through Shorts. The post states this option will appear in the app's Settings once the update arrives.</p><p>YouTube says that once users reach their daily limit, the app will inform them via a "dismissible" notification indicating their Shorts feed will be "paused" until the following day.</p><p>Users can look at this as a sort of "digital wellbeing" update for YouTube's Shorts, as the post highlights the intent behind encouraging better viewing habits/time management. While older users can utilize this to help manage themselves, YouTube says it will bring this to parents "later this year."</p><p>When this update arrives, parents will be able to set a daily limit on Shorts viewing for kid and teen accounts that they supervise. However, the main difference here is that the alerts for younger users will be "non-dismissible." Parents will be able to activate and set a daily limit for their children at will, and disable it, if desired, all the same.</p><h2 id="shorts-are-popular-2">Shorts are popular</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6016px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oU5namDbUAVCZENPFa4Wrf" name="YouTube-Shorts-hero.jpg" alt="YouTube Shorts logo on a mobile phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oU5namDbUAVCZENPFa4Wrf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6016" height="3384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While it's up to the user to decide whether or not they need a "daily limit," it's clear that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-shorts-five-trillion-total-views">YouTube's Shorts are extremely popular</a>. Less than two years after the platform debuted its short-form content, it reported that Shorts had already surpassed five trillion views. This number was achieved across multiple platforms, such as Android phones and laptops.</p><p>While Shorts proved quite popular, YouTube was already looking into ways to help short-form content creators gain more revenue.</p><p>On a related note, it also sought ways to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-shorts-starts-rolling-out-shoppable-video-ads-worldwide">push the shopping experience</a> to people watching Shorts. These videos gained shoppable ads, designed to help advertisers bring their product closer to viewers, in an attempt to, of course, get them to buy that new dress or shirt or pair of shoes. Viewers would see a "Shop Now" button when seeing a shoppable ad, which throws them right into the brand's catalog of available products.</p> ]]></dc:content>

While users are having issues with the app, it only seems to have affected certain devices from Samsung and Google. Moreover, these problems are seemingly only happening when connected to Wi-Fi.</p><p>Users have continued to report problems to Spotify, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.spotify.com/t5/Ongoing-Issues/Android-app-unresponsive-on-a-particular-WiFi-network/idc-p/7159519/highlight/true#M151536">such as one</a> who commented, "Recently, my Spotify app has become unusable while connected to my home wifi."

A Pixel 8 owner from Germany chimed in, reporting similar problems.</p><p>Spotify has offered that users can cleanly reinstall the app on their devices, but that hasn't reportedly helped. The main culprit seems to be that, when connected to Wi-Fi, the Spotify app is crashing on Galaxy and Pixel devices.

The problems forced devices into a seemingly endless loop; however, manually rebooting those phones got them out.</p><p>Some band-aid fixes included shutting off Spotify's notifications and clearing the app's cache.</p><p>The issues happening today have a much simpler solution, though it's still frustrating to have to lean on your data for your music streaming.</p><p>Spotify had a strange issue earlier this year, too, though that involved <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify-premium-subscribers-are-hearing-ads-and-they-arent-happy">Premium users hearing ads</a>... despite being Premium. While speculation suggested it was likely a bug initially, Spotify confirmed as much shortly after those February reports.

The post states that this week, owners of a 2025 Samsung TV will find the new Perplexity AI app available on their set. As an incentive, Perplexity is offering a 12-month subscription to its Pro plan for free after scanning the QR code in the app.</p><p>Samsung states the Perplexity AI app for its TVs is the first of its kind, seeking to deliver "smart, generative AI support to the largest communal screens."</p><p>Ryan Foutty, vice president of business at Perplexity, states, "Curiosity can strike at any time. Perplexity’s mission is to serve the world’s curiosity by bridging the gap between traditional search and innovative AI-driven interfaces." In the name of "curiosity," the Perplexity AI app on Samsung's TVs can reportedly help viewers with queries ranging from simple questions to new shows they might enjoy.</p><p>The post states users can get specific, asking Perplexity AI about "movies directed by the Russo Brothers." Additionally, you can ask the AI to help you plan a trip, if you'd like, without reaching for your phone.</p><h2 id="the-tv-is-the-place-to-be-2">The TV is the place to be</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1067px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="6JQ4RhxgmSQGi3mDW3YyhG" name="samsung-tv-perplexity-ai-launch" alt="Samsung and Perplexity join hands to bring a Perplexity AI app for the 2025 TV experience." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6JQ4RhxgmSQGi3mDW3YyhG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1067" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Perplexity AI app should be available on your 2025 Samsung TV home screen.

The two companies stated earlier this year that they were working to create an open-source spatial audio format called "Eclipsa Audio." The purpose of this format was to bring this technology reliably to more people, as well as creators.</p><p>Samsung was preparing to bring it to its consumers later this year (around Q3/Q4) on its TVs, soundbars, while Google sought to expand it to Chrome browsers and YouTube videos.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This particular deal is for the 512GB storage version of the device, and for the Pantone Scarab color.

However, if that isn't a dealbreaker for you, $900 or $1,000 is a pretty solid price on this phone, so it's definitely worth considering.</p> ]]></dc:content>

And while those are all phenomenal reasons to get a Galaxy XR this year, the real “secret sauce” is the software platform that powers everything.</p><p>That's because <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a>, the operating system running the show, does several things better than any OS before it. Google has taken its time to learn from the mistakes Meta and Apple have made thus far and has designed a brand new version of Android that's changing the paradigm for how an XR headset works.</p><p>Enjoy our content?

Since the beginning, the Meta Quest family of devices has primarily been gaming consoles, with apps and non-gaming applications coming second. Meta tried to convince developers that porting their Android apps over to the Quest would be a worthwhile venture, but 99% of Android developers simply didn't answer the call.</p><p>Apple tried to prevent this by building the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/apple-vision-pro-launch-sales-success">Vision Pro</a> to support iOS apps, but the company made a vital mistake in this implementation: it allowed developers to <em>opt out</em> of support for Vision Pro even though iOS apps can run just fine on the headset. This meant thousands of apps haven't supported the headset from day one.</p><p>But Google and Samsung are doing things differently. <em>Every single</em> Google Play app works on Galaxy XR from day one, meaning there's no need for developers to do anything to make their apps work on the headset. That also means that, unlike with Vision Pro, Galaxy XR buyers don't have to worry about their favorite apps likely never making their way to Samsung's headset. They're all there, and they work gloriously.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="b5qhEdSGH8kVnjNEpbr7Sf" name="Android-XR-infinite-desktop" alt="A mock-up of Android XR showing floating screens in a mixed-reality space, visible on top of a living room." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b5qhEdSGH8kVnjNEpbr7Sf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Some apps have even received substantial built-for-XR upgrades, like Google Maps, YouTube, Google Meet, Chrome, Calm, Fox Sports, MLB, HBO Max, Netflix, and more.</p><p>To help find and juggle all those apps, Google has built Android XR with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> integration from day one. This doesn't just mean the usual AI stuff we've become accustomed to on our phones; it means wholly new paradigms of app interaction.</p><p>So while you certainly can say “Hey Google, open Maps” or something equally pedestrian, Gemini is built to actually <em>interact</em> with the apps and windows on your screen and anything you see through the Galaxy XR’s high-resolution external cameras. So if you've got a bunch of apps open on your headset and are getting overwhelmed, you can ask Gemini to organize the windows, and it'll intelligently arrange them <strong>instantly</strong>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nxuFMJF3BJrHA62DcyLxTf" name="Android-XR-circle-to-search-chrome" alt="A mock-up of Android XR showing floating Chrome screens in a mixed-reality space, visible on top of a living room.

I'm not saying you should use this to do your homework, but if companies are trying to convince people to do their jobs using AI, why not homework, too?</p><p>Apple may have pioneered eye-tracking-based UI navigation, but Google's brilliant implementation of Gemini to act more like a virtual secretary (or even a maid) means you can sit back and relax more often and enjoy all of the great things Galaxy XR has to offer. These two big things — apps and Gemini — have transformed the entire XR experience and made it feel like a profound new way to do all of the things you love.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Galaxy XR was once known as Project Moohan, which means "infinity" in Korean, referring to the infinite amount of space you have to work with in 3D virtual space.</p><p>Galaxy XR represents the biggest investment Samsung and Google have made into the VR and AR category in years. Galaxy XR isn't just a gorgeous, premium mixed reality headset; it's also the catalyst for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr-is-the-most-exciting-new-version-of-android-in-years" target="_blank">Android XR</a>, a new version of Android built from the ground up for mixed reality in the Gemini era.</p><p>The headset resembles a mix between the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/apple-vision-pro-vs-meta-quest-pro" target="_blank">Meta Quest Pro and the Apple Vision Pro</a>, offering full support for hand and eye tracking, as well as motion-based controllers. Samsung isn't positioning this as a gaming console the way Meta is, but the headset still features several popular VR games and is slated to get a whole lot more. From entertainment to gaming, productivity, and so much more, here's everything you need to know about Galaxy XR!</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-xr-launch-and-pricing"><span>Samsung Galaxy XR: Launch and pricing</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="aJmgPPA92R2VBSsuJ8tjAN" name="Samsung-Galaxy-XR-pinch-controls" alt="A photo of Michael Hicks wearing the Samsung Galaxy XR headset, holding up one hand in a pinch gesture." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aJmgPPA92R2VBSsuJ8tjAN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Galaxy XR is available starting October 21, 2025, for $1,799, through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/xr/galaxy-xr/galaxy-xr/">Samsung.com</a> and Samsung Experience Stores.

XR is smartly using a rigid strap similar to the Meta Quest Pro instead of the uncomfortable cloth strap used on the Apple Vision Pro. This helps better distribute weight and provide stability across your head, complete with a nice thick pad along the back of the cranium.</p><p>The strap's size can be quickly adjusted via a dial on the back, similar to Meta Quest Pro or the best <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-meta-quest-3-accessories">Meta Quest 3 accessories</a>. A generous forehead pad keeps all the weight spaced out between the user's forehead and the cushion on the back of the head for maximum comfort.</p><p>That also means there's no weight placed on a user's face at all, a significant improvement to Apple's face-heavy design. Samsung is keeping the battery as a tethered accessory instead of packing it into the headset, ensuring that it weighs as little as possible. Thankfully, you can charge the battery pack while using the headset, potentially adding unlimited time to the estimated 2.5-hour battery life.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="qTQnUuowCKwjxbCTzqzvnM" name="Samsung-Galaxy-XR-with-case-and-controllers" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy XR headset, carrying case, and controllers sitting on four separate plastic pedestals." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qTQnUuowCKwjxbCTzqzvnM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Hidden behind the gorgeous glass front is a set of six tracking cameras, two high-resolution passthrough cameras, one depth sensor, and one flicker sensor.

The 109-degree FoV of these lenses is nearly identical to the Meta Quest 3. Four eye-tracking cameras ring the lenses, and an iris sensor acts as a way to biometrically authenticate yourself for payment apps and unlocking the device.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nxuFMJF3BJrHA62DcyLxTf" name="Android-XR-circle-to-search-chrome" alt="A mock-up of Android XR showing floating Chrome screens in a mixed-reality space, visible on top of a living room.

Eye and face tracking means apps like VRChat can show your real expressions to other players, making it an excellent choice as an ultimate PC VR headset.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-xr-specs-and-performance"><span>Samsung Galaxy XR: Specs and performance</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="EGyMVjCtn48b6R9o8DrLUG" name="qualcomm-snapdragon-xr-mockup.jpg" alt="Qualcomm XR chip mockup" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EGyMVjCtn48b6R9o8DrLUG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung Galaxy XR uses some of the most cutting-edge hardware that can be found on any XR headset to date. That includes micro-OLED panels with extremely high resolution, pancake lenses for the clearest imagery possible, eye tracking built into the lenses, and ultra-high-resolution cameras for clean passthrough mixed reality vision.</p><p>Additionally, Samsung and Google have partnered with Qualcomm and will include the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/qualcomm-snapdragon-xr2-plus-gen-2-announced-for-samsung-headset">Snapdragon XR2 Plus Gen 2</a> inside Galaxy XR.  This chipset delivers 20% higher CPU frequency and 15% higher GPU frequency than the Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 in the Quest 3 and Quest 3S.

Mixed-reality passthrough will enable apps that sit on virtual screens within your real living room, letting you see the world around you while still using virtual apps. It's all powered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr-announcement">Android XR</a>,  a new version of Android that Google says is "the first Android platform built entirely for the Gemini era."</p><p>This means that the entire UI can be controlled via multimodal input, including eye tracking, hand tracking, controllers, and voice input. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a> has full power over the experience and can do virtually anything you need it to do, helping to change the paradigm of how we interact with mixed-reality apps. You can even ask Gemini to organize the windows of apps you have running, making it a very powerful organizational tool.</p><p>When Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p9BtBd-Al8">revealed it on stage</a>, the company said, "You can talk to your device as if you were talking to someone in the physical world." This is because <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/how-gemini-live-video-support-helped-me-grow-plants-in-the-desert">Gemini can see what you see and hear what you hear</a>, including using the cameras on the headset to help identify things around you. This means you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">circle to search</a> for things using your hands, so it's easy to find great cooking recipes and cook hands-free, for example.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="4RfgxtFQxgSCTz5o6LSq3j" name="Headset_GooglePhotos-project-moohan-android-xr" alt="Running Google Photos in mixed reality on Samsung Project Moohan, powered by Android XR" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4RfgxtFQxgSCTz5o6LSq3j.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="281" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Google's XR OS could take a similar approach to VisionOS.  </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In a surprise move, Google confirmed that <em>all</em> Android apps on the Google Play Store will work on Galaxy XR from day one. That's a massive leg-up on both Apple and Meta, as it means all your favorite apps already work on Samsung's new headset.</p><p>Google touts many of its apps running on Galaxy XR, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos</a>, Google Maps, YouTube, Chrome, and others. The headset works for both entertainment and productivity thanks to its hardware design, which allows for high-quality immersive and mixed-reality experiences alike.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r0AyzvfTRLo" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Apps like YouTube can be run in a floating window or in fully immersive theater mode. Better yet, the headset is capable of enhancing 2D videos by adding a convincing layer of 3D depth using onboard AI. In our hands-on, Michael Hicks noted that "while Galaxy XR's hardware is impressive, I wouldn't be as excited for the headset if it weren't for unique Android XR tricks like this."</p><p>While browsing the web, you can pull Chrome tabs off the main window and place them in a floating window, giving you "unlimited monitors" to work on, no matter where you're working from.</p><p>Beyond comparisons to existing headsets, Google hopes to pave a new way to the future through communication with Gemini. Since Gemini can see and hear everything in the real <em>and</em> virtual worlds, it has a significant advantage over Apple's Siri in the Vision Pro and Meta AI in the Quest 3.</p><p>This allows you to have a conversation with Google about what's happening in any app you're using, as well as the room around you, melding the two together in a way that we simply have not seen before.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R_r8MV0GkQE?start=207" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Google showed off a brief Gemini on Android XR showcase during <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/live/news/the-android-show-i-o-special-live-blog-everything-coming-to-android-16">The Android Show</a> on May 13, 2025. This particular demo showed off how Gemini can be used to search for information, but it doesn't work exactly like you're used to. Instead of just pulling up the search results on a single browser tab, Gemini can open multiple applications at a time and give you extensive information with a single query.</p><p>In the example, the person was researching vacation options and Gemini was able to pull up Google Maps, YouTube videos, and even assemble a draft itinerary in Google Docs, all on "the infinite screen," as the presenter called it. This lets you "create an itinerary in minutes" with tons of useful information at your fingertips instead of needing to cycle through multiple apps on a tiny phone screen.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="b2ccf917-5bec-4204-85f6-a8c63b1fcc3b">            <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/xr/galaxy-xr/galaxy-xr/buy/galaxy-xr-256gb-silver-shadow-wi-fi-sm-i610nzsaxar/" data-model-name="Samsung Galaxy XR" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:66.67%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Uv5zjFjU6iH7kRCMd7VmjS.jpg' alt="Galaxy XR front view"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy XR</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The most cutting-edge XR headset ever made is here, and it runs all Google Play apps in a new version of Android called Android XR.

In the future, this could be a thing of the past. You could theoretically say “Hey Google, can you plan out my dinner tonight and send me a shopping list of things I need to get. Then book an Uber for 5 pm, so I can go get supplies right after my Pilates class.”</p><p>Whatever device is near you would pick up on your request and make it happen, with very little interaction from you. Basically, AI will be more than just the apps on your phone; it will be the driving force behind how you interact with your devices.</p><p>We’ve seen examples of this already; Motorola showed off its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-is-testing-ai-that-skips-words-and-gets-straight-to-doing-what-you-ask">Large Action Model</a>, which takes what it knows about you and performs actions with little to no involvement from you —ordering your favorite beverage from a local shop you frequent, for example. Google has also enabled more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-shopping-highlights-upgraded-ai-clothing-makeup">agentic capabilities within products like Chrome</a> that lets it work in the background to complete certain tasks like shopping for groceries.</p><div class="looped-video"><video class="lazyload-in-view lazyloading" data-src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_videos/MainVid_InstaCart_1.mp4" autoplay loop muted playsinline src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_videos/MainVid_InstaCart_1.mp4"></video></div><p>Qualcomm recently shared a vision of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-and-qualcomm-finally-realize-what-ai-is-for">what an agentic and interconnected future looks like</a>, moving seamlessly from one device to another through AI, and we’re getting closer to that future. This means that no matter what device you use, what AI service you interact with, AI will be more accessible to consumers.</p><p>And while today's consumers aren’t necessarily buying phones for just the AI, companies are becoming aware that a growing number of consumers want AI that can actually help them and make their lives easier. Google has demonstrated as much with the launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review">Pixel 10</a>. If you look at any Pixel 10 ad, you will notice that the focus is on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/how-gemini-live-video-support-helped-me-grow-plants-in-the-desert">Gemini Live</a> and how it helps users. Almost nothing is said about the actual phone. This shows that AI is slowly but surely becoming a driving force that will shape consumer spending.</p><p>Here’s IDC’s exclusive take on how AI will shape the future of technology.</p><p><strong>— Shruti Shekar, Editor in Chief</strong></p><p><strong>— Derrek Lee, Managing Editor</strong></p><h2 id="ai-in-the-mobile-world-where-we-are-and-where-we-re-headed-2">AI in the mobile world: Where we are and where we’re headed</h2><p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been quietly shaping the smartphone experience for years. From computational photography to natural language processing, AI has long been embedded in our mobile lives—enhancing photos, powering voice assistants, and optimizing performance.

It worked behind the scenes — improving battery life, enhancing camera performance, and enabling smarter voice interactions. These features were valuable, but rarely marketed as “AI-powered.” Instead, they were sold as better user experiences.</p><p>This changed roughly two years ago when GenAI began appearing in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">premium smartphones</a>. With capabilities like real-time image editing, personalized content creation, and advanced voice interactions, oftentimes with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">on-device</a>, low-latency processing. GenAI brought AI to the forefront, but its reach was limited.</p><p>According to IDC’s Spring 2025 U.S. consumer survey, only 10.9% of respondents said they owned an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-ai-phones">AI smartphone</a>. This is unsurprising given that GenAI was mostly confined to flagship devices. However, it does indicate that the runway for growth is long.</p><h2 id="consumer-interest-is-building-2">Consumer interest is building</h2><p>IDC’s survey also asked those who didn’t own an AI smartphone about their interest in the category. The results were telling: 47.1% said they would consider purchasing one in the future. That's a strong indicator for adoption later on, especially as consumers tend to replace their smartphones once every 3 to 5 years.</p><p>In another 2025 IDC survey from Asia Pacific, 63.5% of respondents said that AI features were somewhat important/very important when purchasing a smartphone, once again underscoring stronger-than-average future interest. However, against the backdrop of other feature considerations, AI took a back seat behind price, brand, and user friendliness.</p><p>Historically, these have been the leading factors when deciding on a new smartphone and have not changed even with the advent of AI. Meanwhile, AI finished outside of the top five most important features.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h-XbeLZag-k" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>This leads us to believe that AI is a tough sell when marketed as a concept, for now. AI in smartphones isn’t a raw spec, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">a suite of intelligent features</a> to provide a superior user experience. Consumers don’t walk into stores asking for an “AI phone.” Rather, they do ask for AI-powered features.</p><p>Take Google Pixel’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-eraser-non-pixel-phones">Magic Eraser</a>, for example. It allows users to remove unwanted objects from photos with a tap. It’s a clear, tangible benefit powered by AI, and consumers ask for such features when purchasing new devices. From PCs to mobile phones, a number of users are using AI-powered features such as chatbots, AI assistants, photo/video editing, writing/editing content, translation, and so on.</p><p>It's features like these that propel the market. By the end of 2025, IDC expects vendors to ship over 370 million GenAI-enabled smartphones worldwide, a 62.5% increase from the nearly 230 million shipped last year, and this grows further in 2026, with volumes surpassing 500 million. This surge means AI is moving beyond premium devices and into the mainstream.</p><h2 id="business-models-will-be-forced-to-evolve-2">Business models will be forced to evolve </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="j4MyfKY3AaBwbdhzX2doN3" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-hands-on-24" alt="Perplexity on the Razr Ultra 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/j4MyfKY3AaBwbdhzX2doN3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>To support this shift, business models will also need to evolve. Today, many phones are subsidized through pre-installed apps such as bloatware from telcos, third-party app stores, and apps or offers for cloud services. But as AI changes how users interact with their phones, these models may become obsolete.</p><p>We've all seen examples where you ask AI to plan a trip and it handles everything, including booking flights, hotels, creating itineraries, and sending calendar invites, all without opening a single app. But this raises a key question: which services does the AI choose to complete these tasks? If apps like Expedia or Airbnb aren’t installed, does the AI default to one based on user history, performance, or a behind-the-scenes partnership?</p><p>Strategic partnerships between service providers, phone makers, and AI platforms are likely to be formed, and we can expect this kind of integration to become more common over the next five years as AI matures and becomes ubiquitous across devices.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PZXr3PzafMr7GowoVSXZwQ" name="oneplus-13-oxygen-os-16-plus-mind-summary" alt="Looking through a summary of gym notes stored in Plus Mind in OxygenOS 16 on a OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PZXr3PzafMr7GowoVSXZwQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>However, this transition won't be easy. As AI becomes the central interface, the traditional app-based business model will face significant disruption. Today, apps and services compete for user attention and strive to own the customer experience. Many will resist handing over control to AI platforms, fearing the loss of direct engagement and brand identity, and will try to maintain their own ecosystems and monetization strategies over the next few years.</p><p>But in the long term, those that integrate best with AI will thrive as consumers often prioritize convenience and efficiency. This also positions AI as the gatekeeper as it chooses which service to use and shifts the customer relationship from the app to the AI.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2831px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="CZgCCLNgjtp9wizx9HgS9U" name="Snapdragon-8-Elite-Gen-5-Ecosystem-of-You.JPG" alt="Cristiano Amon on stage with "Ecosystem of you" on a screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CZgCCLNgjtp9wizx9HgS9U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2831" height="1593" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For the platform players, AI is becoming an extension of the OS, although with various flavors of AI, there is some degree of fragmentation. Apps, services, and potentially even device makers will need to rethink how they engage users, possibly moving toward API-first models that allow AI platforms to access their services directly or by partnering with AI providers to curate unique experiences.</p><p>Those who resist may find themselves sidelined, while those who embrace AI integration will become part of the new mobile paradigm.</p><p>What's the impact on consumers? Prices of AI smartphones are expected to come down from an average selling price of $1053 in 2024 to $786 in 2026. But the AI itself won't be cheap, as all the top companies in this space are eager to monetize their investments through subscriptions, advertising, or other means.</p><p><strong>Apps to actions</strong></p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3749px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="UrHL9Mb3vp3orerrzXJoc5" name="Moto-AI-LAM-Starbucks-Lenovo-Tech-World-2024-5.jpg" alt="Moto AI features demonstrated on a phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UrHL9Mb3vp3orerrzXJoc5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3749" height="2109" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A decade from now, AI won’t just be a feature; it will be the primary interface across a wide range of devices. Smartphones will still play a central role, but they’ll be part of a broader ecosystem of smart glasses, headphones, wearables, and other ambient devices. Consumers will interact with the same AI across these form factors, customized and personalized for each user, choosing the most appropriate device for the task at hand or perhaps letting the AI do so.</p><p>This marks a shift from today’s app-centric experience to a task-centric one. Instead of opening individual apps to complete a task, users will simply ask their AI to “plan a trip,” “book a cab,” or “<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/how-use-google-photos-ai-editing-tools">edit a photo</a>,” and the AI will orchestrate everything behind the scenes.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="B9kkdUCwH7ZFJRViskGDqc" name="rabbit-r1-spotify.jpg" alt="Spotify playing on the Rabbit R1" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B9kkdUCwH7ZFJRViskGDqc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are early versions of this today.

But such devices and interfaces lack polish and are held back by deep integrations into the OS, apps, and services.</p><p>There are already rumors that Google is working on a more deeply integrated version of Gemini, one that could take control of apps and execute tasks on behalf of users. If true, this would be a major leap toward a unified AI experience that spans devices and services seamlessly. But it also means that Google has to rethink how it monetizes Android, and its partners need to figure out if Gemini aids or hinders their own business models.</p><p>In this future, the form factor becomes secondary. Whether you're wearing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">smart glasses</a>, using earbuds, or holding a phone, the experience will be consistent, intelligent, and personalized. The AI will know your preferences, context, and history, enabling it to act proactively and intuitively.</p><h2 id="selling-ai-through-experience-2">Selling AI through experience</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1584px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SSGGBLyPvapWjiGkzEYTfE" name="Live Translate Demo using Android XR smart glasses" alt="Live Translate Demo using Android XR smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SSGGBLyPvapWjiGkzEYTfE.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1584" height="891" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The future of mobile AI isn’t about selling “AI phones.” It’s about selling AI-powered experiences.

With version 16.0 and newer, both in the stable and beta builds, Google has added new toggles that let you hide the period and comma keys from the main keyboard.</p><p>You can find these options in Settings under Preferences, where each punctuation key has its own switch, as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/10/21/gboard-period-comma-keys/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>. By default, both are on, so <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/top-gboard-tips-and-tricks">Gboard</a> looks the same as usual. If you turn one or both off, the bottom row only shows the spacebar, Enter, and ?123 keys. This gives you a wider spacebar and a simpler look.</p><p>This small change has been in the works for a while, previously spotted in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/gboard-hide-punctuation-keys-apk-teardown-3539471/" target="_blank">APK teardowns</a> that hinted at Google experimenting with punctuation visibility.

Still, it may not work for everyone. If you use a lot of punctuation, you might find it a bit less convenient.</p><p>Without the dedicated period key, you’ll have to rely on shortcuts like double-tapping the spacebar to insert one, or jump into the symbol menu with ?123. Unfortunately, there’s no comparable shortcut for the comma, which might frustrate heavy texters who rely on it frequently.</p><p>This feature seems to be rolling out widely and is not limited to any region or language. When you turn it off, Gboard automatically changes the spacing and layout, so you keep the same usability but get a cleaner look.</p><p>Some users on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1oct4b6/gboard_now_lets_you_hide_the_period_and_comma_keys/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> like the simpler design, while others think the punctuation keys should stay visible, since not everyone wants to change settings for something so simple.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Only a few hours after the Galaxy XR headset launched, its optional controllers sold out in the U.S.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-galaxy-xr-hands-on-impressions">Galaxy XR</a> made its debut in the US and South Korea with a hefty $1,800 price tag, marking Samsung’s return to the high-end headset game. The company also offered a pair of tracked controllers for an additional $250, or $175 during a brief launch discount. However, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/mobile-accessories/galaxy-xr/xr-controllers-silver-shadow-sku-et-oi610bjegus/" target="_blank">option to purchase</a> them vanished from Samsung’s U.S. website <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsungs-usd1-800-galaxy-xr-is-here-to-challenge-apple">shortly after the headset went live</a>.</p><p>While it’s still possible to grab a few units in South Korea, the U.S. stock seems to be wiped out completely, and Samsung hasn’t said when more will arrive.</p><p>The situation is more than just a case of high demand for accessories. The Galaxy XR is designed to operate on its own, using a mix of hand gestures, eye-tracking, and voice commands powered by Samsung and Google’s collaborative software.</p><p>That’s great for casual mixed-reality experiences, productivity tools, or spatial apps. But for anyone hoping to dive into more immersive VR titles or PC-VR content, the lack of controllers is a serious setback since many games simply won’t work without them.</p><h2 id="strong-demand-hints-at-a-bigger-vr-appetite-than-expected-2">Strong demand hints at a bigger VR appetite than expected</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2CeenrvW4GFy8T8Y8tncdn" name="Galaxy-XR" alt="Galaxy XR front" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2CeenrvW4GFy8T8Y8tncdn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Interestingly, Samsung has been clear that gaming isn’t the main focus of the Galaxy XR. Instead, it’s pitching the headset as a device built for productivity, creativity, and entertainment rather than the kind of intense VR gaming that Meta’s Quest lineup targets.</p><p>That might explain why the controllers are sold separately and weren’t bundled with the headset at launch. Still, given how quickly they sold out, it’s obvious that plenty of buyers are eager to use the Galaxy XR for more traditional VR experiences.</p><p>For now, Galaxy XR owners in the US are left with two options: wait for Samsung to restock the controllers or make do with the built-in controls until then. Either way, the rapid sell-out shows there’s strong interest in Samsung’s new mixed-reality platform, perhaps even more than the company anticipated.</p><p>If Samsung plans to expand the Galaxy XR’s availability beyond its initial two markets, it might want to ensure its accessory supply can keep up with the growing excitement.</p> ]]></dc:content>

In practice, this means conversations — including calls to landlines or older devices — will have background noise such as wind, traffic or construction filtered out, and voices on both ends will sound clearer. The feature is enabled by default, though users will have the option to disable it if they prefer.</p><p>Another major upgrade: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-fi">Google Fi</a>’s web interface for calls and messages gains full support for RCS (Rich Communication Services). That means users can send high-resolution photos and videos and enjoy richer threads from a browser even if their phone is not within reach. The rollout for this is expected in early December.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="jayPiHXcgWnt4HPkKCGQHe" name="Google-Fi-RCS-messaging-web-large" alt="Google Fi RCS messaging on the web" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jayPiHXcgWnt4HPkKCGQHe.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>To tackle weak indoor signals, Google Fi is expanding its Wi-Fi Auto Connect+ feature. For select devices (currently Pixel 5a and newer) the service will automatically connect to premium Wi-Fi networks at no extra cost and secure the connection via VPN. This expanded capability will cover tens of millions of locations including major airports (LAX, ORD, JFK) and participating retail malls and stores. On such networks you’ll see a “W+” icon in your status bar.</p><h2 id="bills-you-can-actually-understand-2">Bills you can actually understand</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="fFbrXdc48XzCy6FUiQWPQk" name="Google-Fi-billing" alt="Google Fi billing summary" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fFbrXdc48XzCy6FUiQWPQk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In-app support is getting smarter too. The Google Fi app will now generate AI-powered summaries of your monthly bill: what you were charged, what changed since last month, and how any plan adjustments might affect your future costs. This aims to reduce the confusion around mobile bills and avoid needless calls to support.</p><p>To go along with the feature rollout, Google Fi is offering a limited-time promotion: new subscribers bringing their own phone and signing up for either the Unlimited Essentials or Unlimited Standard plans will receive 50% off for 15 months. The offer ends November 4, 2025.</p><p>If you’re already on Google Fi with a compatible device, the upgrades are mostly automatic and won’t cost extra. Google is weaving AI deeper into its mobile service as functional enhancements that address real frustrations: noisy calls, patchy indoor connectivity, browser-based messaging limitations, and opaque bills.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Ahead of its debut, reliable leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MysteryLupin/status/1980752134413914183">Arsène Lupin</a> has shared that the 16GB/512GB variant of the OnePlus 15 will retail for £949 (~$1,260) in the UK.</p><p>The leaker hasn't shared the pricing details for the base 256GB variant of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-14">OnePlus 15</a> yet, or pricing for other markets like the US and India, but the leaked price for the 512GB model could indicate that OnePlus plans to lower prices this year.</p><h2 id="oneplus-might-actually-lower-flagship-prices-this-year-2">OnePlus might actually lower flagship prices this year</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vKJ2HLFpiL3eQUWHFPPu5h" name="oneplus-15-showcase-qualcomm-summit" alt="OnePlus executive holding OnePlus 15 in hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vKJ2HLFpiL3eQUWHFPPu5h.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sanuj Bhatia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For context, the same 16GB/512GB version of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a> currently sells for £999 in the UK. That means if this leak is accurate, the OnePlus 15 could be £50 cheaper than its predecessor. It's unclear whether the base model's price will drop too, though the OnePlus 13's base variant launched at £899, so a small reduction could be on the table.</p><p>This potential price cut is refreshing, especially considering how other smartphone makers have gone in the opposite direction. Both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-xl-vs-pixel-9-pro-xl">Pixel 10 Pro XL</a> and Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-vs-galaxy-z-fold-5">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> launched at least $100 more than their predecessors this year.</p><p>The OnePlus 15, meanwhile, is shaping up to be one of the brand's most ambitious flagships yet. It will be powered by Qualcomm's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-confirms-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</a>, feature a massive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-huge-battery-super-flash-charging-revealed-to-keep-you-scrolling">7,300mAh battery</a>, and sport a 165Hz ultra-high-refresh-rate display designed for smooth, high-frame-rate gaming.</p><p>OnePlus is also officially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-shift-from-hasselblad-official-debuts-detailmax-engine">ending its partnership with Hasselblad</a>, which previously tuned the color science of its cameras, in favor of its new in-house DetailMax Engine that aims to deliver better clarity and more accurate tones.</p><p>With only a few days left until the official unveiling, it won't be long before we know what's really in store. But from what we've seen so far, the OnePlus 15 is shaping up to be one of the most promising flagships of the year.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The brand has a new model in the range dubbed the TV Backlight 3 Pro, and the main highlight is that it gets HDR integration. That's interesting enough in its own right, so I installed the TV Backlight 3 Pro on my 75-inch TV, and used it for the better part of a month.</p><p>The TV Backlight 3 Pro is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Backlight-RGBWWIC-Supports-DreamView/dp/B0FJR9LKBQ">available on Amazon for $179</a>, and that's for the standard model designed to be used with 55 to 65-inch TVs. If you've got a larger TV, you'll need to get the 75 to 85-inch version, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Backlight-RGBWWIC-Supports-DreamView/dp/B0FJRJ8RG2/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3HNZLMGWJ3KWM&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.wMnCK5hien7WrDAf-VwFuV73Bpbe76dWYcKNDJ61lTyzQAmBhylYDMvt7u4jl63xUzMI9P4KZ7AM-IZuBFDf5mDI00wN73cDdKoqlDtuQBsLXn9Ng84cMft4sFSgaZ8Bf1Bk6dTvX5OEC9h2S119KnqNzGmnuTr0c5zo4UfkLOAFNQXYiV6BMMJ4H5UYZkv2NFOdydTpH30V-ZUtaHpdahpad-5TywHS_Lr2cUL2u9pz2g0Ablmacpvqzj2pD4spPg8F3NwE5ohUSMYa8V_72930CByqjPDlP4-x6YXa82w.Cwuu_cstzG-ll9ugZ0o0fx3Z5VrRnFgISOAqDnliyB4&dib_tag=se&keywords=TV%2BBacklight%2B3%2BPro&qid=1761128734&sprefix=%2Caps%2C436&sr=8-1&th=1">which costs $209</a>. The only difference between the two is that the 75 to 85-inch variant gets a 16.4ft LED lightstrip, with the regular model getting 11.8ft.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="ZYB43BULqWGhu8x52eYLcU" name="Govee TV Backlight 3 Pro" alt="Govee TV Backlight 3 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZYB43BULqWGhu8x52eYLcU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Like other Govee products, the TV Backlight 3 Pro is straightforward to set up, and installing it took just over 10 minutes. The camera positioning is better this time around, and it does a good job covering the entire length of the TV. On that note, the camera itself is new, and it has a trio of lenses that do are designed to deliver better color accuracy. Having tested it against the T2, that proved to be the case in my usage — the  TV Backlight 3 Pro got brighter, and it delivered better color rendition in HDR content.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="vY4RFrWFjE5ZwQzyaELLkU" name="Govee TV Backlight 3 Pro" alt="Govee TV Backlight 3 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vY4RFrWFjE5ZwQzyaELLkU.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="FfMF6R7U7h3EpacHJidonU" name="Govee TV Backlight 3 Pro" alt="Govee TV Backlight 3 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FfMF6R7U7h3EpacHJidonU.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="EhSzEkmaKxcvE3mPtaobeU" name="Govee TV Backlight 3 Pro" alt="Govee TV Backlight 3 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EhSzEkmaKxcvE3mPtaobeU.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="sLoL7oMaYjgjiMuHS7ZJcU" name="Govee TV Backlight 3 Pro" alt="Govee TV Backlight 3 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sLoL7oMaYjgjiMuHS7ZJcU.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The lights are brighter as well, with Govee using its RGBWWIC tech.

The streaming platform's "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://help.hbomax.com/US/Answer/Detail/000002547">Plans and Prices</a>" page now details a $1 to $2 price hike across its plans for consumers.

The brand rolled out the Ranger earlier this year, and while the glasses are aimed at cycling, they hold up just as well during any outdoor activity. They're positioned as a 4-in-1 smart sunglasses, able to record footage, deliver built-in audio, serve as a walkie-talkie, and can be used with prescription lenses.</p><p>I've had the glasses for the better part of six months now, but I only started using them in earnest for two months during outdoor workouts, and they've been pretty great. They <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bleequp.com/products/bleequp-ranger-ai-sports-camera-glasses-with-pro-grade-sports-goggles">retail for $379</a>, undercutting Meta's offering by a considerable amount. I used the glasses predominantly with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-17-pro-review">iPhone 17 Pro</a>, and BleeqUp has an Android app that allows you to pair the glasses with just about any phone.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="CSxhdCmrhNuvCAnoScGuY3" name="BleeqUp Ranger" alt="BleeqUp Ranger smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CSxhdCmrhNuvCAnoScGuY3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5032" height="2834" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Let's start with the design; the Ranger weighs just 49g, and is just as light as regular sunglasses. It isn't that much chunkier either, and I like what BleeqUp did with the design. A big barrier to entry for smart wearables is the design, and at a quick glance, you can't even tell that the Ranger is any different to regular sunglasses.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="xAzPnwTmfMh9WoecCAzjg3" name="BleeqUp Ranger" alt="BleeqUp Ranger smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xAzPnwTmfMh9WoecCAzjg3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The glasses are made out of plastic, and I didn't see any issues with the build quality or fit.

In a Reddit post, the company states that it's rolling out two versions of this patch for Pixels. Users with a Pixel 6, 6 Pro, or 6a will see vBP41.250916.010, while every other eligible Pixel sees vBP41.250916.010.<strong>A1</strong>.</p><p>While users who may have held off <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/android/beta">can download Beta 3.1</a> (after enrolling), Google is offering a few solutions for those caught in the loop when QPR2 Beta 3 rolled out last week.</p><p>To begin, Google states users can wait and see if their device "recovers" back to Beta 2 after failing to boot properly. If that doesn't work, the company suggests USB debugging, if you've got that enabled (before the looping occurred). Another option involves downloading the Beta 3.1 OTA from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/16/qpr2/download-ota">Android's Developer</a> site and placing your phone in Recovery mode to install the update.</p><p>Google has provided <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1obvh9e/android_16_qpr2_beta_31_now_available/">a step-by-step set of instructions</a> for five viable solutions to the bootlooping issue from QPR2 Beta 3.  It's worth noting that two solutions should be seen as a last resort, as they will wipe all of your device's data if used.</p><h2 id="major-problems-2">Major problems</h2><blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1obvh9e/android_16_qpr2_beta_31_now_available">Android 16 QPR2 Beta 3.1 now available!</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta">r/android_beta</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><p>Last week <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-qpr2-beta-3-changes">brought Google's next wave</a> of Android 16 tests to enrolled testers, packed with a new button for app shortcuts. An added "+" icon brings more awareness to users that they can pin an app's shortcut. Other additions in the recent test brought Live Captions shortcuts for volume and even larger icons for the search bar.</p><p>QPR2 Beta 3 was quite a substantial patch, judging by its extensive changelog for Pixels, but it was quickly soured a day later by user reports.</p><p>That's when users started reporting the bootloop problems after trying to shift into Beta 3. It was reported that Google quickly removed the patch to avoid any more problems and to keep users who may not have known away from it.</p><p>So far, a few user reports on Reddit claim the patch has solved the issue.</p> ]]></dc:content>

So when Samsung invited me to New York City to demo its Android XR headset, I was ready to dig deeper into Samsung's answer to Apple Vision Pro and Meta Quest Pro.</p><p>I left my 30-minute demo disappointed, not by the headset, but because it only scratched the surface. I enjoyed a spatial 3D tour of NYC in Google Maps with Gemini as my guide and saw 2D YouTube videos converted into 3D using AI — just like I did during my last hands-on.</p><p>This demo reinforced the fact that Samsung has the hardware absolutely nailed: Galaxy XR is wonderfully comfortable, surprisingly light and well-balanced, and features the best resolution (3,552 x 3,840) that I've ever seen on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-vr-headsets">VR headset</a>.</p><p>Enjoy our content?

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-pro-review">Meta Quest Pro</a> failed despite great hardware for the time, because no one wanted a $2,000 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-reportedly-readying-799-quest-pro-three-other-vr-headsets-by-2024">"laptop for your face"</a> with only a handful of app partners and use cases.

Metcalf. Park spoke to "Metcalf," and when she switched to Korean, so did Gemini, translating Metcalf's dialogue while still using his voice.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="aJmgPPA92R2VBSsuJ8tjAN" name="Samsung-Galaxy-XR-pinch-controls" alt="A photo of the author wearing the Samsung Galaxy XR headset, holding up one hand in a pinch gesture." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aJmgPPA92R2VBSsuJ8tjAN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Testing Google Maps in Galaxy XR </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The demo available to journalists was much less ambitious in scope, but I did get the chance to dive into a truly immersive version of Google Maps and have Gemini act as a tour guide. Last time, I explored Yosemite and learned the history of El Capitan; this time, I looked around New York City to find places to visit.</p><p>Something new to the experience was that Google has begun to create "full digital reconstructions of indoor spaces using just 2D imagery and AI."</p><p>Basically, so long as Google has enough user-provided photos of a restaurant, museum, or attraction, you can warp inside it and then drag yourself around the space using gesture controls, seeing what a place looks like "in person" before you visit it yourself. Spear said they have "over 1,000 of these available in New York City alone."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QEU5Xs8NSYTNdwSfZsnMsB" name="Samsung-Galaxy-XR-gesture-controls" alt="A photo of the author doing a two-handed pinch-to-zoom gesture while wearing the Samsung Galaxy XR headset." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QEU5Xs8NSYTNdwSfZsnMsB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Pinching-and-zooming is seamless </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I also dove into YouTube on Galaxy XR. Like last time, they showcased 180-degree and 360-degree videos that take full advantage of VR, as well as stereoscopic content with a 3D effect.</p><p>What most intrigued me was how Google used AI to automatically add spatial layers to 2D videos, subtly transforming old 2D content instead of depending on a limited 3D library.</p><p>Google also added a spatial multiview mode to YouTube for watching multiple live sports games simultaneously. I can't see this coming up very often, but it goes to show how multitasking is a key draw to Galaxy XR.</p><p>Otherwise, Samsung is promising that Galaxy XR will be the "only" XR device with Netflix, with a traditional VR theater view and resizable windows. We'll have to wait and see what other streaming apps appear; in theory, any Play Store app should be available.</p><h2 id="a-mix-of-casual-and-enterprise-use-cases-2">A mix of casual and enterprise use cases</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="M8E9jXaETRhiuqkWo7J8fM" name="Samsung-Galaxy-XR-controllers-2" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy XR headset's controllers." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/M8E9jXaETRhiuqkWo7J8fM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Quest 3</a> owner, I've wondered how Galaxy XR would handle gaming.

But Samsung has an advantage: "All apps built on the Android platform work right out of the box on Galaxy XR." Only a few apps will be "Made for XR," but early adopters won't be waiting impatiently for the promise of new content.

And since you can use a controller or mouse/ keyboard in addition to pinch gestures, it's an upgrade on taps and swipes.</p><p>The real question is whether people can afford to buy this in addition to a laptop, since wearing <em>anything</em> for eight hours a day can be onerous, let alone a one-pound headset. But if you'd normally consider buying a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/should-you-buy-the-samsung-galaxy-tab-s11-or-s11-ultra">Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra</a> for $1,300, the jump to $1,799 may not be that insurmountable to your budget.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="3LizsCrDiGus5EiZbLvJdM" name="Samsung-Galaxy-XR-from-behind-lenses" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy XR headset sitting on a pedestal, focused on the lenses and padding." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3LizsCrDiGus5EiZbLvJdM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I can't predict how well Galaxy XR will sell, despite its tremendous potential. Samsung made sure to mention in its keynote and press release that it'll make AI smart glasses soon, using Warby Parker and Gentle Monster designs.

Galaxy XR has the display and power necessary for a much wider range of use cases.</p><p>While my Galaxy XR hands-on was disappointingly short, the live demos worked near-flawlessly on stage, and they convinced me that "Project Moohan" is an impressive device for anyone who can afford it.

This is a clear way forward for the company to challenge Meta on a substantial level, offering users a way to get familiar functionality without the negative feelings some people harbor toward Meta as a company.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1584px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SSGGBLyPvapWjiGkzEYTfE" name="Live Translate Demo using Android XR smart glasses" alt="Live Translate Demo using Android XR smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SSGGBLyPvapWjiGkzEYTfE.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1584" height="891" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Based on this, we can expect Gentle Monster glasses to look like a normal pair of specs, complete with many different style , lens, and color options. Those glasses will feature Gemini-centric AI functionality that allows users to control the glasses using only their voice. We should also expect these glasses to have cameras on them for recording life from a first-person perspective.</p><p>Samsung's partnership with Warby Parker sounds similar, with the company noting that it's "working with pioneering lifestyle brand Warby Parker, known for leveraging technology to create beautifully designed eyewear and deliver exceptional customer experiences."</p><p>To me, this sounds more like Samsung's direct answer to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-glasses">Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses</a> (that's the one with the display in the lens), similar to what <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/my-demo-with-googles-ar-glasses-went-better-than-the-one-on-stage">we already got to use at Google I/O this year</a>. It's still highly likely that we'll see additional styles from Warby Parker that <em>don't</em> feature a display in the lens, as well.</p><p>The company is mum on specific models, prices, and release dates at this time but notes that AI and XR glasses are "part of its broader XR roadmap" in collaboration with Google.</p> ]]></dc:content>
