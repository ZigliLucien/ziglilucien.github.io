And the Watch 7 has held the undisputed crown of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android watch</a> on our site (and many others) since last year.

This latest version comes in bright 1.3- and 1.5-inch AMOLED display options, up to two days of battery life, revamped health sensors paired with Samsung Health AI insights, and all the apps you could want. You can also spend <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Wellness-Manufacturer/dp/B0D1YL9TRK?th=1"><strong>$229 for the 44mm Watch 7</strong></a> to get a 1.5-inch display. </p><p><strong>Price comparison: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/samsung-galaxy-watch7-aluminum-smartwatch-40mm-bt-green/6585116.p">Best Buy - $219</a> | <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Samsung-Galaxy-Watch7-40mm-Smart-Watch-Aluminum-Bluetooth-Cream/6214656451">Walmart - $209</a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Wellness-Manufacturer/dp/B0D1YNVD88" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="11280a8c-b122-4d26-8c28-42dba0ac3984" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="best Wear OS watch" data-dimension48="best Wear OS watch" data-dimension25="$199.99">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You want a comfortable, speedy smartwatch that will continue to get new features and patches through 2028; you're a fan of Samsung Health and Gemini, and don't mind regular charging.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You want a smartwatch that lasts a few days per charge, more of a traditional watch look, or are afraid to miss out on Galaxy Watch 8 upgrades.</p><h2 id="so-what-s-the-catch-2">So, what's the catch?</h2><p>First, Samsung follows this pattern every year to clear out inventory before its next Galaxy Watch version. Looking at Galaxy Watch 6 deals in 2024, Samsung eventually cut its price in half ($150) by November, before it ran out of stock.</p><p>So as great as this Watch 7 deal looks, it could dip further by the <em>official</em> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-2025-early-deals-and-faq">Amazon Prime Day 2025</a> next month, or even further by the next Prime Day in October, or Cyber Monday. The truth is, we don't know how far Samsung is willing to go with Watch 7 deals, so this could be as good as it gets for a while.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:720px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="FvLpGPSHWpz6Y8KBst9mgE" name="Galaxy-Watch-8-series" alt="Evan Blass leaks renders of the upcoming Galaxy Watch 8 series" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FvLpGPSHWpz6Y8KBst9mgE.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="720" height="540" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Evan Blass)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2880px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WexJkvnPMQW9Qtjwqqq7b9" name="Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-scaled" alt="A render of what the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic might look like, with a circular AMOLED display, rotating metal bezel, orange Action button, and squircle case." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WexJkvnPMQW9Qtjwqqq7b9.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2880" height="1620" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">Render of the alleged Galaxy Watch 8 Classic design </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks / SammyGurus)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The second reason to wait is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide">Samsung Galaxy Watch 8</a>, which should arrive at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-july-unpacked">summer Galaxy Unpacked</a> on July 9. Many details about it are still a mystery, but leaked renders of the Watch 8 and Watch 8 Classic show what they could look like with a squircle face-lift.</p><p>Some people will appreciate that the Galaxy Watch 8 <em>finally</em> has a new look, since the Watch 7 isn't that different from the 2021 Watch 4 or the 2019 Watch Active 2. Others will be disappointed that the polarizing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> design has permeated into the "Classic" lineup, with a rotating bezel on top of a large square case.</p><p>While the Watch 8 will undoubtedly have upgrades over the Watch 7, we don't expect <em>core</em> changes to the display size, battery life, or charging speed. It'll take a few months longer to get new One UI 8 Watch perks, but eventually, they'll be on the same software with tools like Gemini and AI health coaching.</p><h2 id="the-main-reason-to-buy-or-skip-the-cheap-galaxy-watch-7-2">The main reason to buy (or skip) the cheap Galaxy Watch 7</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="35rjmuxKAAXurGy3xc6fPL" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-6-and-6-Classic.jpeg" alt="Close-up of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 and Watch 6 Classic" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/35rjmuxKAAXurGy3xc6fPL.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung has maintained the mainline Galaxy Watch at $299 for the last two generations, but there's no guarantee it'll stay there due to tariff considerations or natural price increases. Buying the Watch 7 now may save you <em>more</em> than $100 compared to the Watch 8.</p><p>Some people skipped the Watch 7 and Ultra because they wanted a return to the "Classic" design. However, since the Watch 8 Classic incorporates the Ultra's design — and will likely cost $430 or more, similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review" target="_blank">Watch 6 Classic</a> — some people may decide that the new generation isn't worth waiting (or paying) for.</p><p>The Watch 6 Classic, while stylish, never really <em>looked</em> like a normal watch, even with an analog watch face. So it's not bad that Samsung is trying to make its watches more distinct and redefine what "Classic" means; only you can decide if the new aesthetics work for you, or if you want to hold out another year for a Watch 9 redesign.</p><p>Ultimately, I'd say that the Galaxy Watch 7 sounds like a great deal right now for anyone who doesn't like where the Watch 8 lineup is trending. But if you have <em>any</em> doubts, hold out another month or two to see if the Watch 8 has any upgrades you can't live without! Then you can decide if these new perks are worth $300–450.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The company today announced Gemini CLI, an open-source AI agent that aims to upgrade your terminal while keeping security and locality at the forefront. Gemini CLI is powered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini 2.5 Pro</a> and offers a one-million-token context window — and best of all, it's free.</p><p>While <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-2-5-pro-and-flash-go-public-as-google-announces-new-flash-lite-model">the latest Gemini 2.5 Pro model</a> is at the heart of the Gemini CLI experience, its capabilities don't end there. The tool can also use Google Search to access real-time data in addition to the model's local knowledge base. It supports growing open specifications, like the Model Context Protocol (MCP), so users can add their own sources and extensions.</p><p>Since Gemini CLI works within your terminal, you can personalize it to match your current workflows and processes. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli" target="_blank">preview is fully open-source</a> , meaning it can be peer-reviewed to ensure it's secure. You would probably want to see what you're adding to your terminal before installing Gemini CLI, and Google is letting you do just that by opening it up.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VWXyY4oRTQtDThAzbawvCT" name="Gemini-CLI-Demo" alt="Gemini CLI running in a command line UI on macOS." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VWXyY4oRTQtDThAzbawvCT.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="400" height="225" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google says that Gemini CLI will add "powerful AI capabilities, from code understanding and file manipulation to command execution and dynamic troubleshooting" to your command-line interface. It'll also make it possible to "write code, debug issues and streamline your workflow with natural language" without using a separate chatbot or IDE, per the company.</p><p>Speaking of integrated development environments (IDEs), Gemini CLI is integrated with Gemini Code Assist for when you'd rather work in an app like VSCode. The two tools are sharing tricks, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/docs/use-agentic-chat-pair-programmer#before-you-begin" target="_blank">Gemini Code Assist now gets an agent mode</a> to match the functionality of Gemini CLI. The idea is that whether you want to work in a terminal or an IDE, you'll have an AI agent to help in Gemini.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:46.44%;"><img id="T2WgT7B7dJr9moFtxCjFad" name="Gemini-CLI-Facts" alt="The stats on Gemini CLI in a promo image." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/T2WgT7B7dJr9moFtxCjFad.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="743" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Developers and programmers that are more familiar with CLIs than graphical user-interfaces (GUIs) might find it easier to integrate Gemini CLI into their processes than a traditional AI chatbot. Similarly, this terminal add-on could give peace-of-mind to users that want to use local, open-source AI on their devices without the hassle.</p><p>It's available in preview starting today for free with a personal Google account, and you can install it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli" target="_blank">here</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Re-released under the 8849 branding in March 2025, this rugged beast packs curious specs.</p><p>I've fiddled with projectors before and find them to be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/i-replaced-my-android-tv-with-a-smart-projector">creative replacements for TVs in cramped spaces</a>. The idea of a portable projector being as small as a phone is amazing, but the Tank 3 Pro is so heavy that it shoots itself in the foot from a portability perspective.

You even get auto and manual keystone options, with a physical knob on the side to manually adjust focus and keystone settings for the projection.</p><p>What really took me by surprise was how easily I could launch and use the projector. There's no learning curve; it's a plug-and-play experience. You're essentially projecting your phone's screen, so you can watch Netflix or YouTube, play games, doomscroll social media, shop online, or do just about anything an Android phone can do, but on a larger display.</p><p>It's as easy as using the Cast feature on an Android phone, but even simpler. All I had to do was point at a wall and project my screen, allowing me to watch videos, give presentations, or browse photo galleries with friends on the go, regardless of my location.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="B4FTvig6kWBSqu7wEPuB2d" name="Unihertz 8849 Tank 3 Pro" alt="Unihertz 8849 Tank 3 Pro Android phone with projector built-in" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B4FTvig6kWBSqu7wEPuB2d.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xXpsuQBZkBJhFkNbW9Rf4d" name="Unihertz 8849 Tank 3 Pro" alt="Unihertz 8849 Tank 3 Pro Android phone with projector built-in" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xXpsuQBZkBJhFkNbW9Rf4d.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sKpm7LicjxbXnvtTuoduAd" name="Unihertz 8849 Tank 3 Pro" alt="Unihertz 8849 Tank 3 Pro Android phone with projector built-in" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sKpm7LicjxbXnvtTuoduAd.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The projected display gets shockingly big while maintaining clarity. The projected screen features a 480p resolution and can be as large as 100 inches.</p><p>I found that the picture quality looks really good for such mid-specs, with decent sharpness and vivid colors, even in a dim to dark room. It's an excellent mid-range quality projection ideal for watching videos like movies, anime, etc.</p><p>The auto keystone works superbly well. I do wish there was a mounting hole bored into the back or some sort of phone case that added compatibility with standard projector stands. The lack of one makes it quite challenging to place the phone on a platform or at a high enough angle properly to aim at a wall or screen.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="6oQVbm8jfAoNcEiKqeeaJd" name="Unihertz 8849 Tank 3 Pro" alt="Unihertz 8849 Tank 3 Pro Android phone with projector built-in" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6oQVbm8jfAoNcEiKqeeaJd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3800" height="2138" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The speaker gets quite loud, even if it's not the best quality.

The phone also has Wi-Fi 6 and a 3.5mm audio jack for connectivity.</p><p>Such a feature requires a ton of power, and boy does this phone deliver. You get a massive 23,800mAh battery and there's a 120W charger included in the box. These are the two main reasons why the Tank 3 Pro is such a hefty lad.</p><div><blockquote><p>Putting this phone in your pockets is a quick way of pantsing yourself.</p></blockquote></div><p>The weight of the device is justified in this case, since it helps the phone last for a week on a single charge. Even with heavy use of the projector, you can squeeze out several days of usage.</p><p>The fun doesn't stop there. I don't know how they did it, but the Tank 3 Pro is a rugged phone with an IP68 waterproof and shockproof rating, despite having a cooling fan, a projector, extra buttons, and a gigantic flashlight. There are so many variables that could potentially interfere with waterproofing, and yet they don't.</p><p>In fact, there is a dedicated underwater use mode that allows users to navigate the phone using only buttons.</p><h2 id="custom-keys-and-sos-function-take-things-further-2">Custom keys and SOS function take things further</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3887px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="3fyyqSEKvNhUspzsig3KNd" name="Unihertz 8849 Tank 3 Pro" alt="Unihertz 8849 Tank 3 Pro Android phone with projector built-in" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3fyyqSEKvNhUspzsig3KNd.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3887" height="2186" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hFaoivzHErQCjtcmpBNdWd" name="Unihertz 8849 Tank 3 Pro" alt="Unihertz 8849 Tank 3 Pro Android phone with projector built-in" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hFaoivzHErQCjtcmpBNdWd.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3763px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="Vn4P8sg9UFrXMcumbf8Fdd" name="Unihertz 8849 Tank 3 Pro" alt="Unihertz 8849 Tank 3 Pro Android phone with projector built-in" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Vn4P8sg9UFrXMcumbf8Fdd.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3763" height="2117" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>It feels like you could have a perfect doomsday companion in the Tank 3 Pro.

There's a multi-use toolkit with handy features, including an alarm bell, a speedometer, a magnifier, a measuring scale, and a compass. This, combined with dual-band GPS, makes it an indispensable companion for outdoor adventures with emergency situations in mind.</p><p>As for the customizable buttons, these can be set to open any app you like.

Unihertz has promised three years of updates for the phone, which is comforting, seeing as it runs the outdated Android 14 out of the box. There's no bloatware either, which is unusual for a Chinese brand like Unihertz.</p><p>Other noteworthy features of the Tank 3 Pro include a Dimensity 8200 chipset, a 6.79-inch 120Hz FHD display, a 200MP main camera, a 64MP secondary camera with night vision, dual-SIM support, and expandable storage up to 2TB. And this isn't the usual trope where there's one SIM slot and another convertible SIM card slot that can only accommodate a SIM or a memory card. Unihertz was generous and added three distinct slots.</p><p>The phone's memory options are great too, with 16GB or 18GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. This can further be expanded up to 36GB by using some of the ROM as RAM temporarily, giving a performance boost when needed.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2nsvLUZ9BKTiaViqiZj2Vd" name="Unihertz 8849 Tank 3 Pro" alt="Unihertz 8849 Tank 3 Pro Android phone with projector built-in" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2nsvLUZ9BKTiaViqiZj2Vd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In the natural order of things, it all comes down to the price. The Unihertz 8849 Tank 3 Pro starts at $629.99 for the 16GB/512GB variant, while the 18GB option costs $719.99. Those are pretty steep numbers.</p><p>Compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>, this is a mid-range price. However, the market that this phone is trying to compete in is portable projectors. You can score a high-quality portable projector like the Anker Nebula Capsule 3 for about $600. The XGIMI MoGo 4 is priced at $499. You get undeniably better resolution and picture quality from such options, and I haven't even mentioned older models from these brands that are much cheaper.</p><p>Despite this, the Tank 3 Pro outperforms the portable projector competition with its massive battery. It's a unique mix of features in a very niche product. The projector is more than just a neat little party trick; it can be extremely useful for teachers or professionals, enabling them to create and show presentations on the fly. Depending on who you are, you might just find it a very convenient assortment of features inside one heavy brick of a phone.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="849bfbed-472c-4dc1-935e-f4b5d057f7f5">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/szjGCjeNuFjdYwWfAF4GRA.jpg' alt="Unihertz 8849 Tank 3 Pro"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Unihertz 8849 Tank 3 Pro</div>                                <div class="stars__reviews"><span itemprop="reviewRating" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Rating" class="chunk rating"><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><meta itemprop="bestRating" content="100.0" /><meta itemprop="worstRating" content="0.0" /><meta itemprop="ratingValue" content="80" /></span></div>                </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Pocket cinema with Android</strong></em></p><p>It looks like a cheap rugged phone from a Chinese OEM, but don't shrug it off just because of that.

But at some point last year, my brain <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/we-need-smaller-flagship-android-tablets">switched things up</a> on me, and I started wanting something in between my foldable phone and laptop. Enter the Lenovo Legion Tab Gen 3, with its 8.8-inch, 165Hz display, and the fact that it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/tablets/android-tablets/lenovo-legion-tab-gen-3/zaef0068us"><strong>currently on sale for around $450</strong></a>.</p><p>Until recently, our only options for a flagship tablet meant that we had to deal with larger displays, maxing out with the 14.6-inch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review">Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra</a>. Most tablets around 11 inches and below usually meant you were going to end up with a mid-range or budget tablet, none of which offered flagship power.</p><p>That's no longer the case, as options like the Legion Tab Gen 3 have arrived here in the States. Previous iterations were only available in other regions, with Lenovo's offering falling under the Y700 branding umbrella.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="e309ddf0-8be5-42fc-bced-dd61f7943fc9" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="The Lenovo Legion Tab Gen 3 is perfect for anyone who wants a powerful and capable Android tablet without feeling the need to carry around a laptop replacement.

However, we don't yet know if it'll eventually make its way here.</p><p>Still, all of this power is housed within a slim and compact form factor, hidden behind an 8.8-inch IPS panel. Normally, this is where I would complain about the decision to forego an OLED screen, but that's not the case here. It almost feels like Lenovo stumbled upon a stockpile of the best LCD panels at this size, as the Legion Tab Gen 3 looks absolutely fantastic.</p><p>It's very similar to the screen found on previous Y700 models, which was the same panel used in the original Lenovo Legion Go. No matter what the reason, this is one of the few times that I actually don't have any problems with the decision to go with an OLED screen.</p><h2 id="go-small-or-go-home-2">Go small or go home</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="i26BrmcRAYpBgL6AhxWmVS" name="lenovo-legion-tab-gen-3-pixel-9-pro-fold-lenovo-chromebook-plus-14-1" alt="Lenovo Legion Tab Gen 3 with Chromebook Plus 14 and Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/i26BrmcRAYpBgL6AhxWmVS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are a couple of reasons why I enjoy having a powerful tablet that's smaller than my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-ipad-pro-m4-13-inch-long-term-review">iPad Pro</a> or Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra. The first is that the Legion Tab has essentially become my digital notebook, especially with a matte screen protector installed.</p><p>Oh yeah, the Legion Tab supports stylus input when paired with Lenovo's Tab Pen Plus. While there are times when a larger canvas is nice to have, it gets pretty cumbersome if you need a scratchpad by your side throughout the day.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="zSMqZ6HY8oQomiQifeEwUS" name="lenovo-legion-tab-gen-3-with-stylus" alt="Notes app with stylus on Lenovo Legion Tab Gen 3 with matte screen protector" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zSMqZ6HY8oQomiQifeEwUS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The other main reason why I enjoy having a flagship tablet at this size is the obvious one — gaming and emulation. Technically, it's possible for me to use the 14.6-inch Tab S10 Ultra with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/gamesir-g8-plus-review">GameSir G8 Plus</a>, but as you might suspect, it's beyond comical.</p><p>Instead, the Legion Tab Gen 3 is compatible with a variety of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-game-controllers-android">mobile controllers</a>, and you won't look absolutely absurd if you were to pull this out while waiting at the airport. Okay, maybe a little absurd, but nowhere near as bad as the Tab S10 Ultra.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="tQJVJ4bsWLU6f6QK4BjoWS" name="lenovo-legion-tab-gen-3-halls-of-torment-razer-kishi-ultra" alt="Lenovo Legion Tab Gen 3 playing Halls of Torment connected to Razer Kishi Ultra with other controllers in the background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tQJVJ4bsWLU6f6QK4BjoWS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="a-few-gripes-but-still-worth-every-penny-2">A few gripes, but still worth every penny</h2><p>Admittedly, this isn't the <em>perfect</em> tablet for everything I want it to do. For instance, my biggest gripe is that you're limited to just one storage configuration. Anyone who's messed around with higher-end emulation knows that won't last very long, at which point you're either transferring files back and forth, or need to rely on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/practically-all-of-the-best-android-phones-are-hindered-by-this-one-dumb-thing">portable SSD</a>.</p><p>I'm also very confused as to why Lenovo didn't include biometrics beyond "Face Unlock." It's also not the <em>good</em> version from the Pixel, meaning it's not as secure. Surely Lenovo could've spent a few pennies and embedded a fingerprint scanner in the power button. It's not a deal-breaker by any means, but more of a curious and confusing omission.</p><p>Nevertheless, the Legion Tab Gen 3 is still one of my favorite tablets of the year, and as mentioned before, you can save a few bucks. Currently, it can be had for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/tablets/android-tablets/lenovo-legion-tab-gen-3/zaef0068us"><strong>around $100 off</strong></a>, which is $50 below the expected retail price before the tariff nonsense forced OEMs to raise prices.</p> ]]></dc:content>

POCO is continuing that momentum with the debut of the standard F7. Although the device doesn't have too many similarities to the F7 Ultra, it is interesting in its own right.</p><p>The F7 is powered by the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4, which has huge performance gains over the 8s Gen 3. I enjoyed using the chipset in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/iqoo-neo-10-review">iQOO Neo 10</a>, and it is just as performant on the F7 — Nothing is also set to use it on the Phone 3. But what makes the F7 that much more enticing is the value; POCO is once again undercutting its immediate rivals, and that makes the device a downright bargain.</p><p>I used the F7 for the better part of two weeks, and if you want a mid-ranger, there really isn't anything that gives you quite as much value.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-poco-f7-pricing-and-availability"><span>POCO F7: Pricing and availability</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="XXB9HAhiTuxvkCarMLTZAQ" name="POCO F7" alt="POCO F7 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XXB9HAhiTuxvkCarMLTZAQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>POCO unveiled the F7 on June 24, and the phone is set to go on sale starting July 1. The phone is available for ₹31,999 ($372) for the 12GB/256GB model, and ₹33,999 ($395) for the edition with 12GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. It's good to see POCO providing 256GB of storage with the base model — just like last year.</p><p>Over in the U.K., the POCO F7 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mi.com/uk/product/poco-f7/buy">retails for £389</a> ($530) for the 12GB/256GB model, and £429 ($584) for the 12GB/512GB variant. If you're interested in buying the phone before July 7, you can pick up the 12GB/256GB model at £319 ($434) and the 12GB/512GB model at £359 ($488).</p><p>It will cost the equivalent of $399 for the 12GB/256GB model in other global markets, with launch pricing at $339. The 12GB/512GB model costs $449, with POCO bringing it down to $399 during the launch window.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-poco-f7-what-i-like"><span>POCO F7: What I like</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CYcDM43utUVmx2cC396m9Q" name="POCO F7" alt="POCO F7 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CYcDM43utUVmx2cC396m9Q.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>POCO doesn't shy away from bold designs, and the F7 takes this to a new level.

On that note, the phone has a huge 6,500mAh battery, and it lasts over a day and a half with medium use. Even if you binge an entire season of a TV show in one go, you'll get a day's worth of use out of the device.</p><p>My only annoyance with the battery is that the global model doesn't have the gargantuan 7,550mAh silicon battery that's exclusive to the Indian model. POCO did this in the past as well where it limited the bigger battery to the Indian version, and I want to see that change.</p><p>Other than that, the phone gets 90W charging, and it takes just over 44 minutes to charge the device.

The phone uses a 50MP Sony IMX882 as the main camera, and it's joined by an 8MP wide-angle lens and a 20MP front camera that lacks autofocus.</p><p>The phone takes decent photos in most conditions, but it isn't going to win any awards. You can get beautiful shots if you're willing to tweak the settings, but it isn't anywhere as effortless to use as the Pixel 9a or even the iQOO Neo 10. The 8MP wide-angle lens is strictly average, and it doesn't measure up in low-light situations. You get 4K60 video, but stabilization isn't great.</p><p>Another issue is with the software; while I generally like what POCO is doing in this area, the F7 has way too much bloatware installed out of the box. Yes, you can uninstall or disable most utilities, but most users won't bother doing so.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-poco-f7-the-alternatives"><span>POCO F7: The alternatives</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="nnEjdrnXZ5GAEwnZWTFaTQ" name="iqoo-neo-10-2" alt="iQOO Neo 10 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nnEjdrnXZ5GAEwnZWTFaTQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I like the iQOO Neo 10; it has a lot of the same features, and you get a 7,000mAh battery as standard alongside 90W charging.

While smartphone displays have gotten stupidly bright in the last few years, many are still difficult to see in direct sunlight.</p><p>That's where the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> comes in. While some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> have brighter displays, the Galaxy S25 Ultra turns the tables by implementing a brilliant anti-glare layer that makes it dead easy to see in the sunlight, and that's great for anyone who spends a lot of time outdoors, especially this time of year.</p><p>But not all is rosy with Samsung's latest flagship display. While the display excels in several areas, lingering problems from the Galaxy S24 Ultra haven't been properly addressed. Let's take a deeper dive into what makes the Galaxy S25 Ultra so good to use outside and why it's a little tougher to enjoy indoors.</p><p>And with Prime Day right around the corner, be sure to check out some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-deals-of-the-month">Galaxy S25 Ultra deals</a> ↓, as some pretty hot ones are already live.</p><h2 id="comfort-is-key-2">Comfort is key</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="PMGmZoK3rZwMt7WQ59uTKB" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-ui-lockscreen-widgets-neon" alt="A Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra with a widget-covered lockscreen on a rainy neon-soaked street" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PMGmZoK3rZwMt7WQ59uTKB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In the modern era, all flagship phone displays look good. This applies to most phone specs these days, from performance to camera quality, which means differentiating products usually comes down to one or two categories that a product is strongest in.</p><p>Most display reviews and analysis <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-displays-arent-the-gold-standard-you-think-they-are">focus too much on lab tests</a> and not enough on the human part of the equation. Most people don't care about the difference between 97% and 99% color accuracy, and it's unlikely most people will ever notice that difference anyway, even if you hold two phones next to each other. Instead, I want to focus on the human quotient for these display reviews.</p><p>In the case of the Galaxy S25 Ultra, its display is weakest in the comfort category, but it has some standout attributes that are noteworthy. Let's start with the positive!</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-reflectivity"><span>Reflectivity</span></h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:67.58%;"><img id="YvPeSi8LiMTv4uvRQM6hKe" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-vs-oneplus-13-reflectivity-above" alt="Testing screen reflectivity in full sunlight between the OnePlus 13 and Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YvPeSi8LiMTv4uvRQM6hKe.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:67.58%;"><img id="5BsK2xaJaV2ynqyyzaGfGe" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-vs-oneplus-13-reflectivity-side" alt="Testing screen reflectivity in full sunlight between the OnePlus 13 and Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5BsK2xaJaV2ynqyyzaGfGe.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Samsung's anti-glare filter, first introduced on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, is one of the best things Samsung has ever done for screen visibility. In the above images, I compare it to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>, our current favorite Android phone, and one with higher peak brightness capabilities than the Galaxy S25 Ultra.</p><p>Despite being a brighter display, the OnePlus 13 is harder to see outdoors because of the reflectivity of the glass. The Galaxy S25 Ultra is incredibly clean and vibrant, while it's just plain difficult to see the OnePlus 13. Now, to be clear, I'm not picking on OnePlus here. Nearly every other phone on the market is just as hard to see, and it's because almost no other company uses the type of anti-glare glass the S25 Ultra has.</p><p>The only problem here is that most screen protectors for the phone don't have an anti-glare layer applied, meaning <em>everything</em> that makes the display so visible outdoors gets ruined. Make sure you get one like this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Anti-Reflecting-Fingerprint-Anti-Scratch-EF-US938CTEGUS/dp/B0DKZ7F64Y/">official Samsung anti-reflection film</a> to keep the display's best attribute from being ruined!</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-eye-comfort-settings"><span>Eye comfort settings</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PmNk3tqBQiWRdMRBrPP3eY" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-eye-comfort-mode-blue-light-filter" alt="Comparing the blue subpixel brightness on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra with eye comfort mode enabled and disabled" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PmNk3tqBQiWRdMRBrPP3eY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung's blue light filter, which the company calls "Eye Comfort Shield," helps block blue light by reducing the intensity of blue subpixels. This makes the display appear much yellower and does a good job of reducing blue light emissions.</p><p>You can see this in action in the image above, which I captured with a microscope using a pure white image on the screen. Note how the intensity of the blue subpixels is notably reduced when Eye Comfort Shield is enabled.</p><p>By default, the mode will automatically adjust blue light based on the time of day. During daylight hours, blue light will be close to the default setting as if the mode were disabled.

The main problem is that Samsung continues to use 8-bit panels in their phones despite the entire industry switching to 10-bit as the standard.</p><p>For the test, I used an 8-bit and 10-bit gradient comparison image <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/jursonovicst/gradient">found on GitHub</a>. On the Galaxy S25 Ultra's panel, there's little to no difference between the 8-bit and 10-bit gradients. The OnePlus 13 shows additional colors throughout all the gradients, although the green gradient showed up best on camera.</p><p>Many users have complained about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1800809349214028132">color banding on wallpaper</a> and other images, even ones taken with the Galaxy S25 Ultra's camera, since that camera can capture 10-bit images. And while Samsung absolutely needs to upgrade their displays to 10-bit to keep up with the pack, I want to commend them for not stooping to using color dithering to fake 10-bit color. Some other companies, like Xiaomi, use color dithering to fake deeper colors and it's painful for some users because of the flickering pixels.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-brightness-and-dimming"><span>Brightness and dimming</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:30.17%;"><img id="UNtpQJQV6hpfX8ckEVY7Fe" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-brightness-comparison" alt="Comparing brightness levels of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra's display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UNtpQJQV6hpfX8ckEVY7Fe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="5184" height="1564" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Everything this phone tells you about its brightness levels is a lie.

That's normally reserved for the dedicated "sunlight mode" that gets activated when a bright light, like the sun, shines on the screen's light sensor.

Having reviewed dozens of Garmin watches, I can point new and returning Garmin users to the models they should try first. Otherwise, you'll spend too much without being prepared for the downsides.</p><p>In my mind, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watches</a> fall into three tiers: Baseline, mid-range, and expensive.

They also have the "worst" battery life, but still tend to hit between 1–2 weeks, crushing the competition.</p><p>I tend to recommend mid-tier Garmin watches, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review" target="_blank">Venu 3</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-3-review" target="_blank">Instinct 3,</a> first because they offer an upgraded experience while costing <em>only slightly</em> more than an Apple Watch. The problem is that these, too, have downgrades and cut features to make the expensive tier more attractive, like the outdoor-focused Instinct 3 not offering maps.</p><p>As amazing as watches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Fenix 8</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-ditched-my-apple-and-galaxy-watches-for-a-garmin-and-you-should-too">Enduro 3</a> are, I just can't recommend a thousand-dollar watch to anyone who isn't already familiar with Garmin's UI quirks and labyrinthine Connect app. Instead, let's get you started with Garmin watches that will let you dip your toes into the ecosystem and see whether you like it.</p><h2 id="which-garmin-watches-justify-their-price-to-beginners-2">Which Garmin watches justify their price to beginners</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4109px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="2nX3bKtM98uLsNbfyJyjBC" name="Garmin-Vivoactive-6-review-12" alt="A workout animation on the Garmin Vivoactive 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2nX3bKtM98uLsNbfyJyjBC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4109" height="2311" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With a major event like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/amazon-prime-day">Amazon Prime Day</a> approaching, you may be hoping for a major deal to make Garmin watches more accessible.

Use that information to set a realistic expectation: a mid-range Garmin watch will rarely fall into my baseline tier, even with an amazing deal.</p><p>If you're looking to get started with the Garmin brand at a reasonable price <em>and</em> with relatively new hardware, consider the 2025 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-vivoactive-6-review">Garmin Vivoactive 6</a>.

It's less attractive and misses out on dozens of the Vivoactive's sports modes, but you get an altimeter added for elevation tracking — vital for hikers and runners — and daily suggested run workouts.</p><p>I wish it had tools like the Forerunner 265's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-training-load-focus-needs-one-obvious-fix">training load</a> or the Forerunner 970's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-forerunner-970-running-tolerance-tool-too-useful-to-be-premium-feature">running tolerance</a>, but the Forerunner 165 gets runners started with Garmin Coach, training effect, and post-run recovery suggestions without overwhelming you. It's currently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Forerunner-Smartwatch-Colorful-Training/dp/B0CT3SGHXL"><strong>$40 off on Amazon, near an all-time low</strong></a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VxGCm8dpYqd2VyKhsu5wVn" name="Garmin Lily 2 Active" alt="Garmin Lily 2 Active" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VxGCm8dpYqd2VyKhsu5wVn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p>My final Garmin rec for beginners, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-lily-2-active-launch-details">Garmin Lily 2 Active</a>, isn't one I've personally used, but I was surprised to see my sister Megan bought one (without any recommendation from me) and loves it.</p><p>Unlike short-lived Garmin hybrids like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-vivomove-trend-review">Vivomove Trend</a> with no built-in GPS, the Lily 2 Active lasts nine days, or nine hours with GPS. But it still looks stylish thanks to its aluminum bezel and patterned lens background, and at just 29g and 11mm thick, it's comfortably light.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Stylish-Smartwatch-Patterned-Silicone/dp/B0DGWDRGP6"><strong>Lily 2 Active</strong></a> isn't for you if you need an AMOLED display or the most advanced features, but many people <em>don't</em>! What they want from Garmin is accurate health data like heart rate, stress, blood oxygen, sleep stages, breathing, steps, and menstrual cycle tracking. You can still follow on-device strength workouts or meditation guidance, but otherwise, this is a simple and attractive device to ease you into the Garmin ecosystem!</p><h2 id="you-can-t-go-wrong-2">You can't go wrong</h2><p>Overall, the Garmin Vivoactive 6, Forerunner 165, and Lily 2 Active are my three recommended starting points for the brand! If you can't stomach compromise, you can always go for the Venu 3 to get Garmin's best health sensors, a stylish steel bezel, and a mic & speaker for Bluetooth calls.</p> ]]></dc:content>

But I have noticed that I hold a phone like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> differently than I hold my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2024-review">Motorola Razr</a>.</p><p>On the Razr, I want to move it down to the bottom. On the Pixel, I want to keep it at the top. Having the choice means it works for me on both phones.</p><p>Individually, none of us is so special that Google needs to change something to satisfy us. But as a whole, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-io-android-3-billion-active-devices">Android is all about its users</a>; it wouldn't exist without us. Something small, like providing options to make your software better for everyone, is the way to go, Google. Let's see more of it.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This isn't surprising, per se, as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-13t-smal-display-flagship-power-china-launch">OnePlus 13T</a> grabbed the SD 8 Elite, like the original 13 flagship.</p><p>More than that, DCS claims the OnePlus 15T will sport a bigger battery than the expected OnePlus 15 flagship.

While we're still expecting OnePlus to stick with its strong <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-introduces-new-glacier-battery-featuring-6100mah">Glacier battery tech</a>, the OnePlus 13 and 13T had a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-13t-smal-display-flagship-power-china-launch">similar occurrence take place</a> this year. The former launched with a strong 6,000mAh battery; however, the 13T took that up a little with its 6,260mAh battery.</p><p>Considering how early these rumors are, it's unclear how much larger the OnePlus 15's battery could be (if there's an upgrade in the cards). There's speculation that the Chinese OEM could keep it at 6,000mAh with a boost ready for the 15T, but that remains to be seen.</p><p>Since the 15T will more likely than not play off the OnePlus 15, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-specs-chipset-camera-leaks">some recent leaks</a> could give us an idea of what to expect. One similar thing is its supposed 1.5K resolution for its screen. Though things change as the flagship could sport a 6.7-inch display with that. There are conflicting rumors about its primary camera. Some claim it will land at 50MP while others suggest OnePlus could kick it up to 200MP.</p><p>Regardless, OnePlus flagships usually launch in China first, toward the end of the year, in the fall. This timeline could shift slightly earlier this year, following rumors that the Snapdragon 8 Elite 2<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/early-snapdragon-8-elite-2-quicker-summit-phone-launch-rumors"> could launch in September</a>, not October.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The company states users should find its payment option available during checkout while shopping online on "select" Android apps and websites. Klarna's chief commercial officer, David Sykes, said, "Integrating with Google Pay marks a meaningful step in Klarna’s mission to bring flexible, transparent payments to where consumers already are."</p><p>Klarna is positioned to enhance Google Pay's available Buy Now, Pay Later choices when purchasing expensive products. The post states users will have access to Klarna's "Pay in four payments" feature. This lets you submit "four fixed payments" that are interest-free for purchases over $35.</p><p>The company adds, "Financing is available for higher ticket items with monthly repayments made over a longer period of time starting at 0% APR."</p><p>It might take a little while before Klarna shows up when purchasing items in supported apps/websites on Android with Google Pay.</p><h2 id="more-choices-better-shopping-2">More Choices, Better Shopping</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="pWThapBgXmQHVgMJ7HiwjS" name="Google-Pay-hero.jpeg" alt="Google Pay app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pWThapBgXmQHVgMJ7HiwjS.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google Pay's BNPL (buy now, pay later) function <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pay-adds-new-features-to-make-online-shopping-less-of-a-nightmare">saw an expansion last year</a>, when the company introduced Affirm and Zip. With these third-party providers, consumers could pay more comfortably for items across more websites and apps. Similar to Klarna, it's worth keeping an eye on when your next installment's due date is to avoid missing it.</p><p>Google also improved the way users interact with their card information when paying. That update brought in the ability to confirm crucial card details without its security code, but instead with your fingerprint. Consumers could also opt for typing in a PIN or using facial recognition, too.</p><p>On a related note, Google Wallet's been rumored to have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-nfc-card-adding-function-tipped">a seamless, NFC-based card-adding feature</a> in the works. Some early signs suggest that all users would need to do is hold their desired card close to their device "until it vibrates." Your phone, leveraging its NFC, would grab its details and input them in their appropriate areas. This would only (seemingly) work for cards that are EMV compliant.</p><p>More importantly, this feature will leave the most critical detail to you: the card's CVV. There's also a lot more planned for NFC on phones, with the NFC Forum highlighting its ambitions to give users more things to do with a "single tap."</p> ]]></dc:content>

This is why smartphone manufacturers have been upping the ante when it comes to security. You store your social media logins, banking information, personal photos, important files, and the list goes on.</p><p>Google offers <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-beta-glimpse-advanced-protection-security-bastion">Advanced Protection</a> for its Google Pixel phones as well as other compatible Android devices through an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-review">Android 16</a> update. It’s considered the “strongest layer of security” for protecting not only your devices but also your Google Account. All you need to do is enroll, and you can take advantage of the added protection against hacks, malware, unsafe apps, and thieves. The best part? It’s free!</p><h2 id="how-to-enable-advanced-protection-on-a-google-pixel-phone-2">How to enable Advanced Protection on a Google Pixel phone</h2><p>1. Open the <strong>Settings app</strong> on your Google Pixel phone.</p><p>2. Scroll down and select <strong>Security and Privacy.</strong></p><p>3. If this is the first time you’re accessing this setting from the device after the Android 16 update, select <strong>See details</strong> under Advanced Protection. If not, scroll down and select <strong>Advanced Protection</strong> under Other settings.</p><p>4. <strong>Toggle the switch</strong> to the right and select <strong>Turn on</strong> to confirm. You'll receive a prompt to restart the phone.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SauWoitJjM9FNixpE5Kj8V" name="Google Advanced Protection" alt="Advanced Protection on a Google Pixel phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SauWoitJjM9FNixpE5Kj8V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Christine Persaud / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="what-do-you-get-with-advanced-protection-2">What do you get with Advanced Protection?</h2><p>Advanced Protection includes many features to help safeguard your device and personal information. Combined with other security features, it’s one of the reasons the latest Google Pixel phones rank among <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-phone-security">the most secure Android phones</a>.</p><p><strong>Device theft protection</strong>: This locks your phone automatically if motion indicates potential theft, like the phone is grabbed furiously and then moves in rapid motion, suggesting it was confiscated. The phone also automatically locks when the device is offline and restarts if it’s locked for three days.</p><p><strong>App protection</strong>: The phone scans Google Play for unsafe apps and malware and blocks the installation of apps from unknown sources. If there’s an app you want or need that isn’t in the Google Play store, and thus isn’t considered a trusted source, you won’t be able to download it.</p><p>Even some apps in the Play Store may not have received approval for download with Advanced Protection. In these instances, you’ll receive a warning. You should only install this app if it’s from a trusted developer. To go ahead and install it anyway, go to <em>See details</em> on the app page, select <em>Continue to install</em>, then Install.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="78AKgsT4vMSXBJk7k5qPYF" name="Google Pixel Advanced Protection" alt="Google Advanced Protection" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/78AKgsT4vMSXBJk7k5qPYF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Christine Persaud / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Network protection</strong>: On compatible devices, the phone will avoid unsecure 2G networks to prevent you from connecting to a vulnerable network.</p><p><strong>Web protection</strong>: Harmful webpages will be blocked, and you’ll receive warnings before visiting non-HTTPS websites via the Chrome browser. Some advanced capabilities will also be turned off to reduce risks via JavaScript protections.</p><h2 id="what-else-to-know-about-advanced-protection-2">What else to know about Advanced Protection</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xFcUb3nVmMUNe2hzrtRmVF" name="Google Pixel Advanced Protection" alt="Google Advanced Protection" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xFcUb3nVmMUNe2hzrtRmVF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Christine Persaud / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What might be the reason you <em>don’t </em>want to enable Advanced Protection? As noted, it can limit what apps you can install on the device to just approved ones from the Google Play Store, Android Debug Bridge, and preinstalled Android app store apps. If there are other essential apps you need for work or specific projects, you might have to turn them off.</p><p>If you don’t want to enroll in Advanced Protection, there are things you can manually do on your Google Pixel phone to still ensure your private information stays that way. Download the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-is-google-play-protect">Google Play Protect</a> app and use it to manually scan the device to look for potentially harmful software. The advantage with Advanced Protection, however, is that this step is done automatically for you.</p><p>Given all the benefits of Advanced Protection, like automatically turning on theft detection, enabling protections for scams and spam in Google Messages, and ensuring you can’t disable features like the Google Play Protect malware protection and Android Safe Browsing, it’s worth considering. The best part is that if you decide it’s too restrictive and you want to handle your own safeguards beyond the standard Google Pixel security features, you can reverse the steps above to turn Advanced Protection off at any time.</p><p>Google Advanced Protection is available for all Pixel phones from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> and later, including ones that rank among <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">the best Android phones</a> you can buy right now. Baked into Android 16, you can also access it from other Android devices that support this latest OS and eventually, beyond.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="3aca5898-380d-4940-bda1-888b3fef02af">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KuP5kCbWwCMJf95Fcb6Twb.jpg' alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro XL official render- Obsidian - front and back"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 9 Pro XL</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>It's like Fort Knox</strong></em></p><p>Google Pixel phones like the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL are already ultra-secure.

The post reiterates Google's previous shift to TSMC after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/is-googles-switch-from-samsung-foundry-to-tsmc-for-the-tensor-g5-chip-a-big-deal">spending time with Samsung</a> for its Tensor chip development. The publication's alleged source claims Google will move to a 2nm process for the Tensor G6.</p><p>This is a very early rumor, considering we're likely a year (or more) away from Google revealing the Tensor G6. However, one thing that's is that we're expecting this chip to power the Pixel 11 series in 2026.</p><p>The overseas publication's sources didn't chime in with more info about the SoC. Not surprising, especially given how early this rumor has surfaced—and things can always change.

A huge leak from Google's gChips Division suggests the Pixel 11 series could receive several "Video Generation ML" tools for video editing capabilities. Moreover, the way Google has been rumored to "push" this chip, consumers could find more health-focused features for breathing, sleep apnea, gait analysis, and more.</p><p>Strangely, those early rumors claimed the Tensoe G6 could've been based on a 3nm process like the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-has-reportedly-finished-designing-the-pixel-10s-custom-tensor-g5-soc">G5 for the Pixel 10</a>.

It seems we're still in for the same four phones this year, those being a Pixel 10, 10 Pro, 10 Pro XL, and a 10 Pro Fold. Following an early and sold-out case listing by Thinborne, there might be some subtle physical element shifts, such as the SIM slot, USB-C port, and speaker cutouts.

That makes the new OnePlus Pad 3 a natural competitor to the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra.</p><p>While they're both <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">great Android tablets</a>, they also come with a lot of differences. The biggest one is cost: the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra costs a whopping $500 more than the Pad 3 at full price.</p><p>The question is, does the OnePlus Pad 3 offer a premium experience comparable to that of the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra? The short answer is probably yes, unless you need the gargantuan screen on Samsung's tablet or DeX. For those considering whether to save with the Pad 3 or spend on the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra, this complete comparison is for you.</p><h2 id="oneplus-pad-3-vs-samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-design-and-display-2">OnePlus Pad 3 vs. Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="HpbtmNPDxyTrnCce7t58PN" name="ES-DE for Android on the OnePlus Pad 3" alt="ES-DE for Android on the OnePlus Pad 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HpbtmNPDxyTrnCce7t58PN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The OnePlus Pad 2 was a curvy tablet with unique features, like a circular camera housing centered on the device's rear. With the new Pad 3, that's all changed. The tablet now features a boxy, rectangular design language similar to the Samsung Galaxy Tab lineup.</p><p>That includes flat edges, a rear camera positioned in the back corner, and uniform bezels. In fact, our reviewer said, "the more I looked at the latest OnePlus tablet, the more I realized how much it reminded me of the iPad Pro and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review">Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra</a>." In a way, the OnePlus Pad 3 feels more premium, but it's also becoming just like many of the other tablets on the market today.</p><p>OnePlus has made a significant change to the Pad 3's display, as it now measures 13.2 inches. However, the size is the only aspect changed about the OnePlus Pad 3's display, as it remains an IPS LCD panel with a 144Hz refresh rate and a 900 nits peak brightness rating. For some, this will be a disappointment. However, LCDs do have advantages in certain areas and are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">friendly for PWM-sensitive people</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="VJ8LiPqZCbMBBX2og6cSUR" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review-3" alt="Console Launcher on Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VJ8LiPqZCbMBBX2og6cSUR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Meanwhile, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra ends up feeling more like a laptop than a tablet due to its even larger form factor. While the OnePlus Pad 3 is one of the biggest Android tablets on the market, the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra's 14.6-inch screen is just that much bigger. It also uses AMOLED display technology, which could be preferred if you're not a fan of LCD.</p><p>It's also worth noting that the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra comes with an S Pen in the box, while the Stylo 2 for the OnePlus Pad 3 costs another $100.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="kRz7rTtnrWGzv5hZDCgsMN" name="Back of OnePlus Pad 3" alt="Back of OnePlus Pad 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kRz7rTtnrWGzv5hZDCgsMN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's impossible to understate the size difference between the OnePlus Pad 3 and the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra.

Samsung's tablet is thinner, but has a larger footprint overall — and that's compared to the OnePlus Pad 3, which is a big tablet in its own right.</p><p>That will make the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra a better laptop replacement, but less portable and versatile than the OnePlus Pad 3.</p><h2 id="oneplus-pad-3-vs-samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-hardware-and-specs-2">OnePlus Pad 3 vs. Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="hv8NUhNFFZwdogshxor4cR" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review-9" alt="Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra using Samsung DeX with multiple windows open" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hv8NUhNFFZwdogshxor4cR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>OnePlus did what Samsung probably should've done by putting Qualcomm's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> chipset inside the Pad 3. The Snapdragon 8 Elite is a computing breakthrough for Android and has brought significant year-over-year performance gains to devices powered by it. Compared to the MediaTek-powered Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra, the OnePlus Pad 3 might have the edge in raw performance.</p><p>Our testing shows the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra and its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediateks-new-dimensity-9300-chip-brings-higher-clock-speeds-and-better-ai-processing">MediaTek Dimensity 9300 Plus</a> perform similarly to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-ultra-review">Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra</a>, but that may not be good enough. The latter device is powered by the two-year-old Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, which isn't on the same level as the newer Snapdragon 8 Elite. Even as some configurations of the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra have 16GB of RAM (the base model has the same 12GB as the Pad 3), that won't be enough to beat Qualcomm's newest processor.</p><div ><table><caption>Specs</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>OnePlus Pad 3</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>OxygenOS 15 (Android 15)</p></td><td  ><p>One UI (Android 14) [upgradeable]</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>13.2-inch LCD, 3392 x 2400, 144Hz, 600 nits standard, 900 nits peak, </p></td><td  ><p>14.6-inch AMOLED, 2960 x 1848 120Hz, 500 nits, 16:10</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite</p></td><td  ><p>MediaTek Dimensity 9300 Plus</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>12GB LPDDR5X</p></td><td  ><p>12GB / 16GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB (UFS 4.0)</p></td><td  ><p>256GB / 512GB / 1TB (expandable via microSD)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera</p></td><td  ><p>13MP, 4K @ 30fps Video Recording, EIS, Digital Zoom</p></td><td  ><p>13MP (wide) + 8MP (ultrawide)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Selfie Camera</p></td><td  ><p>8MP</p></td><td  ><p>12MP (wide) + 12MP (ultrawide)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Audio</p></td><td  ><p>8 Speakers (4 Woofers + 4 Tweeters), 2 Microphones</p></td><td  ><p>Quad AKG-tuned speakers</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>12,140mAh, Up to 80W charging </p></td><td  ><p>11,200mAh, up to 45W charging</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Biometrics</p></td><td  ><p>Face Unlock</p></td><td  ><p>Optical Fingerprint scanner under-display</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.3</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>289.61 x 209.66 x 5.97mm</p></td><td  ><p>326.4 x 208.6 x 5.4mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>675 grams</p></td><td  ><p>718 grams</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Storm Blue</p></td><td  ><p>Moonstone Gray, Platinum Silver</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Samsung does have the edge in storage configurations and upgradeability.

That is certainly the case here. OnePlus improved its software support guarantee this year, offering three years of Android OS upgrades for the Pad 3. It starts with Android 15, so it should see Android upgrades at least through Android 18. On top of that, you'll get six total years of security patches.</p><p>Samsung crushes that with seven years of Android OS upgrades and security patches for the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra. It did launch with Android 14, so it has already received one of those upgrades to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a>-based <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review">One UI 7</a>. Still, it is better support than OnePlus offers for the Pad 3. You'll have to decide whether the extra cost of the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra is worth the extended software support window.</p><p>Finally, it's worth considering whether you need a lot of AI tools on your tablet. The Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra has a full suite of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI features</a>, plus Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> offerings. OnePlus does have its own AI tools, but they're not as expansive as Samsung's at the moment.</p><h2 id="oneplus-pad-3-vs-samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-which-should-you-buy-2">OnePlus Pad 3 vs. Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra: Which should you buy?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="6H6maSEcHzfNXUeFKpWCQN" name="Notes app - OnePlus Pad 3" alt="Notes app - OnePlus Pad 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6H6maSEcHzfNXUeFKpWCQN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Put simply, the OnePlus Pad 3 is the better value compared to the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra. That's not to say Samsung doesn't add things to justify the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra's asking price — an OLED screen, the biggest display size in an Android tablet, and DeX support are all key additions. It's just unlikely that <em>not</em> having these things on the OnePlus Pad 3 will be a dealbreaker for most tablet users.</p><p>When you consider the cost savings, the $700 OnePlus Pad 3 feels like the easy recommendation for people wanting a powerful Android tablet. You can create a full kit with the OnePlus Pad 3, a keyboard case, and a stylus for less than the cost of <em>just</em> the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra.</p><p>Still, if you want the biggest and best, and are willing to pay for it, the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra is a great option.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="b2749ca7-4914-43cc-a76b-0ec90e8b7105">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dMmvFb94iBy4sRar8eZMwS.jpg' alt="OnePlus Pad 3"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">OnePlus Pad 3</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The best value</strong></em></p><p>There may not be a tablet on the market today with a better price-to-performance proposition than the OnePlus Tab 3.

But some digging into the app’s latest version uncovered hidden text hints that Google is planning to give users a friendly nudge to switch it on soon.</p><p>A recent APK teardown by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/messages-rcs-notices-3569341/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> reveals that Google is preparing a new feature that auto-fills a prompt to send to friends still stuck on SMS. If you're not using RCS yet, expect a friendly nudge from your RCS-using buddies to finally flip the switch.</p><p>When Google Messages spots that someone is still on SMS, you’ll get a “Text an invite” option. Phrases like “invite this contact to RCS chat” and “we can share high-quality media and send secure messages when we’re both on RCS” hint that nudging friends to upgrade will be quick and easy, with barely any effort on your end.</p><h2 id="one-tap-guilt-trip-2">One-tap guilt trip</h2><p>Interestingly, right now on Android, the RCS invite link just sends people to the Google Messages' Play Store page—even if they already have the app. That’s not super helpful for people who have installed it but haven’t turned on RCS yet. Still, there’s a good chance Google will tweak the link before this feature officially becomes public.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:387px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:222.22%;"><img id="kzqvefb4YaaeAe6DBVkzTM" name="Google-Messages-RCS-invite-prompt" alt="RCS invite prompt in Google Messages" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kzqvefb4YaaeAe6DBVkzTM.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="387" height="860" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:387px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:222.22%;"><img id="sEakWfzv3ME76j5zatYwTM" name="Google-Messages-RCS-invite-prompt" alt="RCS invite prompt in Google Messages" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sEakWfzv3ME76j5zatYwTM.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="387" height="860" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>These new RCS prompts aren’t live just yet, but their appearance in the app’s code hints that Google is gearing up for a launch soon.</p><p>And honestly, the push makes sense—RCS seriously levels up your messaging experience with typing indicators, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-read-receipts-placement-redesign-spotted">read receipts</a>, crisp photo and video sharing, better group chats, and end-to-end encryption for an extra layer of privacy.</p><p>To join the RCS party, just tap your profile picture in the top right of Google Messages, head to Messages settings > RCS chats, and flip the “Turn on RCS chats” switch.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Still, there's something about the Pixel Watch that just doesn't catch my interest. Maybe it's the small-feeling screen, waterdrop design, the short battery life, or the dark user interface.</p><p>Either way, after a few failed attempts to switch to a Pixel Watch, it's clear the popular Google smartwatch simply isn't for me. The device doesn't feel as useful or engaging as others I've worn from Apple, Samsung, Garmin, and OnePlus. For around the same price as the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Google Pixel Watch</a>, there are a few smartwatches that I think do a better job of earning a spot on your wrist.</p><p>If you're like me — an Android phone user that doesn't think a Pixel Watch is the right fit — these are the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best wearables</a> you should look at instead. And with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-2025-early-deals-and-faq">Amazon Prime Day</a> just around the corner, there's a chance that some or all of these devices may be on sale, making it a great time to snag a new smartwatch.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-watch-7"><span>Samsung Galaxy Watch 7</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7vBWqR7YmxhZ8GXJvnJtgf" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review-lemon-lime-ultra-info-board-2.jpg" alt="Ultra Info Board on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7vBWqR7YmxhZ8GXJvnJtgf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ara Wagoner / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While the Pixel Watch is getting better and better each year, I think the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Samsung Galaxy Watch 7</a> should still be the default wearable for Android users. Samsung has been making "smart" wearables for longer, and it shows in the Galaxy Watch 7. Although the Google Pixel Watch takes influence from the company's Fitbit acquisition, it isn't always a positive influence. For instance, you need a Fitbit Premium subscription to get the complete fitness experience.</p><p>Arguably, my biggest complaint with the Pixel Watch is that I find its dark UI to be gloomy and not engaging. It's designed this way to hide the Pixel Watch's large black bezels and preserve battery life, but it falls flat in my experience.

When I tested the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2r-review">OnePlus Watch 2R</a> last year, I was impressed by the device's sleek design, fitness and health features, and smooth UI at its price point. The newer OnePlus Watch 3 takes that to the next level while retaining 100-hour battery life. You'll probably have to charge the Pixel Watch 3 every day, but the OnePlus Watch 3 will give you a few days between charges.</p><p>OnePlus is a smaller company, and that means the Watch 3 will be a lot less universal than the Pixel Watch 3 or Galaxy Watch 7. There's no LTE option here, which is a bummer, and the same goes for the ECG feature. If you can live without those options — I know I definitely can — the OnePlus Watch 3 is easier to view as a real option. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-expands-its-mid-tier-lineup">smaller size incoming</a> helps, too.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="XGMfVFB3GyuriuV4tB2hi" name="oneplus-watch-3-workout-watch-face-with-shoes-01" alt="A OnePlus Watch 3 with a fitness watch face on a pair of workout shoes" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XGMfVFB3GyuriuV4tB2hi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What I really love about OnePlus Watch models is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-hands-on">how engaging their fitness and health tools feel</a>. They're bright and colorful, with charts and rings that make you want to dive into your workout insights. It reminds me of how Apple Watches inspire people to improve their fitness, though crucially, without the pressure that comes with wanting to close their Apple Watch rings every day.</p><p>If you're an outdoor adventurer, runner, or general fitness nerd, I think the OnePlus Watch 3 makes a great case against the Pixel Watch 3. The insights, functionality, and presentation are just better and more helpful, and it won me over.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="7dd1b010-198f-4742-a960-08e8a83d1246">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AneZzpatZ7PriQ6DuceUsf.jpg' alt="OnePlus Watch 3"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">OnePlus Watch 3</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The battery life champ</strong></em></p><p>The OnePlus Watch 3 might be the antithesis of the Pixel Watch 3, as it's large, bulky, and loud.

I was, too, but I recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-ditched-my-apple-and-galaxy-watches-for-a-garmin-and-you-should-too">made the leap from Wear OS and watchOS devices to GarminOS</a>, and haven't looked back. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-vivoactive-6-review">Garmin Vivoactive 6</a> is a sneaky Pixel Watch 3 alternative — perhaps the best one on this list. That's because the Vivoactive 6 preserves the small and subtle aesthetic of the Pixel Watch 3 while providing an experience I think will be more complete.</p><p>It's available in four fun colors — Slate, Lunar Gold, Metallic Jasper Green, and Metallic Pink Dawn — but doesn't have as many durability concerns as the Pixel Watch 3. The Garmin Vivoactive 6 has a flat display with Gorilla Glass 3, a fiber-reinforced polymer case, and an anodized aluminum bezel. Best of all, the entire thing weighs 36 grams, including the strap.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4109px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="2nX3bKtM98uLsNbfyJyjBC" name="Garmin-Vivoactive-6-review-12" alt="A workout animation on the Garmin Vivoactive 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2nX3bKtM98uLsNbfyJyjBC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4109" height="2311" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>By leaving Wear OS behind, battery life gains become paramount. In smartwatch mode, you can get 11 days out of the Vivoactive 6, which should be a refreshing change of pace. Even Garmin's older v4 Elevate HR sensor is great, making the Vivoactive 6 comparable to newer options from brands like Google and Samsung.</p><p>For me, switching to a Garmin and prioritizing health insights over "smart" features was the right call. If that sounds intriguing to you, the Garmin Vivoactive 6 could be a better pick than the Pixel Watch 3.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="d1198b2d-dca8-4055-a9f5-f1a6669f9d6c">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/secwvVBDhnoMFv8tL5mbJ6.jpg' alt="The Garmin Vivoactive 6 against a white background."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Garmin Vivoactive 6</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>A fitness-first competitor</strong></em></p><p>The Garmin Vivoactive 6 ditches Wear OS in favor of battery life and fitness features, and for some, it'll be worth it.

Motorola <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/moto-edge-2025-ai-key-stylish-design-launch">launched</a> the Edge 2025 in May with upgrades given to the camera, battery, processor, and display. It even has a dedicated AI Key, similar to what we saw on the Motorola Razr Ultra. The single RAM and storage variant costs $550 in the U.S., which doesn't sound too bad at first, but there's also heavy competition to consider.</p><p>The Google Pixel 9a is currently one of the best cheap phones in this segment, and the Motorola Edge 2025 goes directly up against it. The Pixel offers great AI features, years of software updates, fantastic battery life, and a more compact form factor. Deciding between these two devices can be tricky if you're not familiar with their offerings, but this Motorola Edge 2025 vs. Pixel 9a comparison can help.</p><h2 id="motorola-edge-2025-vs-google-pixel-9a-design-display-2">Motorola Edge 2025 vs. Google Pixel 9a: Design & display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ms9nJVnkvpq6X9HkQ9phmC" name="Motorola-Edge-2025-home-screen-04" alt="The home screen of the Motorola Edge 2025 in its default configuration" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ms9nJVnkvpq6X9HkQ9phmC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-edge-2025-review">Motorola Edge 2025</a> follows a similar design language to the rest of the Moto G series, which launched in 2025. This means you get a vegan leather back panel, a four-lens cutout in the camera island, and tapering edges for a slim feel. In the U.S., the Edge 2025 comes in just a single color called Deep Forest, and just one variant with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. If you ask me, the limited choice of colors and storage is an indication that Motorola isn't entirely confident about this phone.</p><p>The Edge 2025 feels great to hold and use thanks to the vegan leather back panel. It's also quite slim at under 8mm in thickness, and light at just 181g. Motorola has enhanced the ingress protection this time, raising it to an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">IP69 rating</a>. This puts it on the same level as pricier phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>.</p><p>The brightness of the 6.7-inch pOLED display has been bumped up to 4,500 nits, and the resolution is still solid, giving it a pixel density of roughly 444 ppi. The scratch resistance has also improved, thanks to Corning Gorilla Glass 7i. The downside is that Motorola has reduced the refresh rate to 120Hz, down from 144Hz on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-2024-review">2024 Edge</a>. In practice, the lower refresh rate is not much of a deal-breaker as the display holds up well under sunlight and is very responsive for tasks like gaming.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="asxeqoV8jCKM9gVDtwZwx5" name="Google-Pixel-9a-Iris-2" alt="The Google Pixel 9a in Iris on a rock fixture." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/asxeqoV8jCKM9gVDtwZwx5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">Pixel 9a</a> comes in a multitude of colors and, like the Edge 2025, doesn't use glass for the back panel. This makes it less prone to damage in the event of a fall. Google has taken a different design approach, though, with flat sides and a minimal rear camera bump. The phone is also a lot more compact and pocketable thanks to the smaller display.</p><p>Speaking of which, you get a 6.3-inch pOLED panel with a similar pixel density as the Moto, and a 120Hz refresh rate. The scratch protection is only Gorilla Glass 3, which is inferior to what Motorola uses. The maximum brightness is also a lot lower at just 1,800 nits. While we didn't face any major issues using the 9a outdoors, Google still uses the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/my-phone-is-making-me-sick-and-im-not-alone">flicker-heavy PWM dimming</a> method for lowering the brightness, which can cause headaches if you're eyes are sensitive to it. There are also visibly thicker bezels around the display, which isn't very flattering to look at.</p><h2 id="motorola-edge-2025-vs-google-pixel-9a-hardware-specs-2">Motorola Edge 2025 vs. Google Pixel 9a: Hardware & specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rLBDKvxbe5ZsLeRVaNWxmN" name="Motorola-Edge-2025-back-06" alt="The vegan leather back of the forest green Motorola Edge 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rLBDKvxbe5ZsLeRVaNWxmN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Motorola Edge 2025 retails for $550 in the U.S. for the sole 256GB storage variant. You can get it unlocked or via your carrier, where the latter seems like the better route to buy it. The phone is powered by a MediaTek Dimensity 7400 Ultra SoC, which is a slight improvement from the Snapdragon powering the 2024 Edge model, but it's not fast enough. During our review, we frequently encountered lag and stuttering when using apps or navigating the interface.</p><p>Even Minecraft on the Vibrant Visuals setting wouldn't run smoothly. The other main reason this feels overpriced in the U.S. is that Motorola sells the same phone under a different name (Edge 60/Fusion) in other countries like India for nearly half the cost (Rs. 23,000 or roughly $270).</p><p>Motorola has beefed up the cameras for sure if you compare the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-edge-2025-vs-edge-2024">Edge 2025 vs. the 2024 Edge</a>. We now have a 50MP ultrawide that also doubles as a macro camera, and a 10MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom. There's even a 50MP selfie camera with autofocus, which should capture more detailed images than the Pixel 9a. Motorola has managed to offer a slightly larger 5,200mAh battery in the Edge 2025 with an insanely quick 68W fast wired charging. There's even 15W wireless charging.</p><div ><table><caption>Specifications</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Category</strong></p></th><th  ><p><strong>Motorola Edge 2025</strong></p></th><th  ><p><strong>Google Pixel 9a</strong></p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>OS</strong></p></td><td  ><p>Android 15</p></td><td  ><p>Android 15 (upgradable to Android 16)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Software Promise</strong></p></td><td  ><p>2 OS upgrades</p><p>3 years of security updates</p></td><td  ><p>7 years of OS upgrades</p><p>7 years of security updates</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Colors</strong></p></td><td  ><p>Pantone Deep Forest</p></td><td  ><p>Obsidian, Porcelain, Peony, Iris</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Screen Size</strong></p></td><td  ><p>6.7 inches</p></td><td  ><p>6.3 inches</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Screen Resolution</strong></p></td><td  ><p>2,712 x 1,220</p></td><td  ><p>2,424 x 1,080</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Screen Type </strong></p></td><td  ><p>pOLED Super HD</p></td><td  ><p>pOLED FHD+</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Refresh Rate</strong></p></td><td  ><p>120Hz</p></td><td  ><p>120Hz</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Processor</strong></p></td><td  ><p>MediaTek Dimensity 7400</p></td><td  ><p>Google Tensor G4</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>RAM</strong></p></td><td  ><p>8GB</p></td><td  ><p>8GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Storage</strong></p></td><td  ><p>256GB</p></td><td  ><p>128GB/ 256GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Cameras</strong></p></td><td  ><p>50MP main, 50MP ultrawide with macro, 10MP telephoto, 50MP front</p></td><td  ><p>48MP main, 13MP ultrawide, 13MP front</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Speakers</strong></p></td><td  ><p>Stereo Speakers (Dolby Atmos)</p></td><td  ><p>Stereo Speakers (Dolby Atmos)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Battery</strong></p></td><td  ><p>5,200mAh</p></td><td  ><p>5,100mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Charging</strong></p></td><td  ><p>68W wired, 15W wireless</p></td><td  ><p>23W wired, 7.5W wireless</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Bluetooth</strong></p></td><td  ><p>5.4</p></td><td  ><p>5.3</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Water Resistance</strong></p></td><td  ><p>IP68/IP69</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Cellular</strong></p></td><td  ><p>5G</p></td><td  ><p>5G</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Size</strong></p></td><td  ><p>161.19 x 73.06 x 7.99mm</p></td><td  ><p>154.7 x 73.3 x 8.9mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Weight</strong></p></td><td  ><p>181 grams</p></td><td  ><p>185.8 grams</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="T59tVwzcwoKR8dyxhLEtuj" name="Google-Pixel-9a-on-bench" alt="The Google Pixel 9a sitting on a bench next to a reading gnome." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/T59tVwzcwoKR8dyxhLEtuj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Google Pixel 9a starts at $499 for 128GB of storage and $599 for 256GB. Comparing the same storage tiers of both phones, the Edge 2025 does come out a bit cheaper, but it's still not enough. The Pixel 9a has a more potent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> SoC, which delivers better performance for AI tasks, apps, and gaming. When we tested it, the 9a ran flawlessly with no lag or stuttering issues.</p><p>The Pixel 9a also has a great set of cameras. Despite the lower resolution than the Edge 2025, Google's post-processing is far ahead of Motorola's capabilities. This isn't the best phone for zoom photography since it lacks a dedicated telephoto lens, but it's great for pretty much everything else.</p><p>Battery life is one of the strong suits of the Pixel 9a, thanks to the massive capacity. You should easily be able to get nearly two full days of usage out of this. Charging speeds are not the best when compared to the Motorola, sadly. The 9a has an ancient 23W fast charging over wire and measly 7.5W with a wireless charger.</p><h2 id="motorola-edge-2025-vs-google-pixel-9a-software-2">Motorola Edge 2025 vs. Google Pixel 9a: Software</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xEfKGfryXxX5DRtQTPWaCW" name="Motorola-Edge-2025-Moto-AI-02" alt="Moto AI running on a Motorola Edge 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xEfKGfryXxX5DRtQTPWaCW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Motorola Edge 2025 ships with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a>, but will be getting just two OS upgrades and three years of security patches. That's a bit low even for a $550 phone since the Pixel 9a is supported for seven years. The Edge 2025 comes with some of the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a> features that debuted with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Motorola Razr Ultra</a> earlier this year. Some of the notable ones include Catch Me Up and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/how-use-moto-ai-playlist-studio">AI Playlist</a>. These features can be accessed via the dedicated AI key, and many of them are pretty useful.</p><p>The Pixel 9a does not have a dedicated AI button, but the AI features are far more impressive. It shipped with Android 15 but has since received Android 16, and it stands to get seven years of OS and security updates. The 9a supports some of the newer AI features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-add-me-google-pixel-9">Add Me</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-astrophotography-mode-google-pixel">Astrophotography</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-use-macro-focus-on-pixel-7-pro">Macro Focus.</a> The phone runs a slightly watered-down version of Gemini, called Gemini Nano, for on-device AI tasks. It's still highly functional, but certain features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-the-pixel-screenshots-app-on-the-google-pixel-9">Pixel Screenshots</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-call-notes-google-pixel">Call Notes</a> will not work.</p><h2 id="motorola-edge-2025-vs-google-pixel-9a-which-one-should-you-buy-2">Motorola Edge 2025 vs. Google Pixel 9a: Which one should you buy?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="N8wpvHELb2TPLrXCayXfE9" name="Google-Pixel-9a-on-ground" alt="The porcelain Google Pixel 9a sitting on top of bark on the ground." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N8wpvHELb2TPLrXCayXfE9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you live in a country like the U.S., where the Motorola Edge 2025 and Pixel 9a are similarly priced, you should put your money toward the Pixel. It's a more powerful phone that's more pocketable, has way longer software updates, superb battery life, and a unique design.</p><p>The Edge 2025 is simply too expensive in the U.S. for what it offers, and only makes sense if you get it at a heavy subsidy via your carrier, or during a sale. Even so, keep in mind that the processor is a bit weak for gaming, you're only getting two OS upgrades, and it looks just like any other Moto G series phone.</p><p>The Edge 2025 does have its appeal in countries like India, where it sells for nearly half the price. Suddenly, these shortcomings don't seem that bad, and one can make a case for it.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="abece3cd-47bd-49b8-b213-2296120f6636">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LBMcwTEvmFhbHXUbog2FBX.jpg' alt="Motorola Edge 2025"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Motorola Edge 2025</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Wait for a price drop</strong></em></p><p>The Motorola Edge 2025 has some very good qualities like the IP69 rating and great rear cameras, but the weak performance and short-term software support makes it seem overpriced.</p></p>                </div>                <div class="pro-con"></div>            </div>        </div>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="e379e990-638e-4eee-9a77-b5e18bc69ad1">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rvNsKzJHfhe3Kn6XztwrQn.jpg' alt="Official render of the Pixel 9a in Porcelain"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 9a</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Still the best value in the U.S.</strong></em></p><p>The Google Pixel 9a offers far better value than the Edge 2025 thanks to a crazy-long update commitment, better performance, and a more eye-catching design.</p></p>                </div>                <div class="pro-con"></div>            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

The upcoming clamshell from Xiaomi is expected to ship with at least 12GB of RAM and Android 15 running out of the box.</p><h2 id="power-house-in-a-clamshell-2">Power house in a clamshell</h2><p>Per the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/status/5180276399407888">latest information on Weibo</a>, the Mix Flip 2 is expected to launch as early as June 26 and is tipped to launch globally alongside China. The primary folding screen will supposedly measure 6.85 inches, featuring a 120Hz refresh rate. The external screen, on the other hand, will likely measure 4.01 inches and support most of the applications on the handset without the need to open up the clamshell often.</p><p>The two primary cameras are expected to be 50MP cameras each, and the device should likely have either a 5100mAh or 5600mAh battery capacity based on the region availability. Lastly, it is tipped to support 67W fast charging, next to 50W wireless charging.</p><p>With the tipped launch date, it appears Xiaomi will likely release the Mix Flip 2 right before the Galaxy Z Flip 7 from Samsung, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-july-unpacked">now officially has a July 9</a> launch date.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The Meta Quest 3S is already a value-focused VR headset, but the inclusion of a pre-installed Elite Strap (a $70 value), an Xbox controller (a $65 value), 3 months of Gamepass Ultimate (a $60 value), and 3 months of Horizon+ (a $24 value). That's <strong>$119 worth of stuff you're getting for free</strong>, plus the fact that there's no other way to get this black-and-green-themed bundle.</p><p>The Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition can play all the latest Quest 3-exclusive games like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/batman-arkham-shadow-review">Batman Arkham Shadow</a>, plus all the VR classics like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/assassins-creed-nexus-vr-review">Assassin's Creed Nexus</a> and Beat Saber. In addition, you get access to a giant, resizable virtual screen to play regular Xbox games on anywhere you're sitting, whether that's in your living room or on a plane.</p><p>While the Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition won't hook up to the Xbox in your living room — like a PlayStation VR2 hooks up to a PS5 — it's totally wireless and can play Xbox games so long as you have Gamepass and internet access.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="AaW5gmbysM6HcZMaMoTTbM" name="meta-quest-3s-xbox-edition-official-lifestyle-minecraft-dungeons" alt="An official lifestyle image of someone playing Minecraft Dungeons using a Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition headset" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AaW5gmbysM6HcZMaMoTTbM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1536" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Microsoft / Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The big draw of using a Meta Quest 3S for Game Pass is that you get a completely personal screen to play on that can be moved anywhere you want. That eliminates neck fatigue brought on by holding a handheld console for a long time, and it also means that you don't need to hog up the TV to play the games you want. It also means you can play those mature Xbox games in the same room your kids are watching Baby Shark without them seeing you tear up demons in Doom.</p><p>It's a similar experience to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">best Smart glasses</a>, but having a headset on means you get a much wider field of view and also get the option to play <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/one-year-later-mixed-reality-games-are-booming">mixed reality games</a> or even fully immersive VR games when you want.</p><p>If you want to learn more, check out our sister site Windows Central's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/meta-quest-3s-xbox-edition-hands-on-review">Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition hands-on</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

And to celebrate its 20th birthday, Google Earth is rolling out a nostalgic update: historical Street View, now baked right into the Earth experience.</p><p>What started as a 3D map app is now a massive time machine in your pocket, full of satellite snapshots, rare discoveries, and even Hollywood-worthy reunions. With its latest update, you can now hop into Street View and roll back the clock to see how your city or street looked a decade or two ago.</p><p>This feature even got social media buzzing recently with #somewhereonGoogleMaps as people <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps-earth-street-view-expands-ai">virtually time-traveled to see how places evolved</a> and find their loved ones in imagery.</p><h2 id="from-fun-to-life-changing-2">From fun to life-changing</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2496px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:63.86%;"><img id="HCQV5nDPNUzxJJ387LqD3E" name="Google-Earth-overhead-image" alt="Overhead image from Google Earth" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HCQV5nDPNUzxJJ387LqD3E.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2496" height="1594" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Beyond the fun of virtual tourism, Google Earth has racked up some pretty impressive milestones. Back in 2005, it was downloaded 100 million times in its first week. When Hurricane Katrina hit just months later, first responders used updated satellite views from Google Earth to coordinate disaster response.</p><p>Over the years, Google Earth has quietly helped discover coral reefs, ancient human relatives, and even long-lost family members. In 2016, Saroo Brierley used Earth imagery to retrace his childhood journey and reconnect with his birth mother in India—25 years later. That story turned into the Oscar-nominated film Lion.</p><p>In 2012, Google ditched the satellites and flew a little closer to Earth—literally. It used helium balloons and kites to snap aerial photos over Oakland, California, kicking off the era of community-captured imagery. Fast forward to today, and you’ve got professionals using Google Earth to evaluate solar panel viability and building designs before even setting foot onsite.</p><h2 id="ai-for-the-planet-2">AI for the planet</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:51.44%;"><img id="srSPLq4XbNfVVzKqSeXwrj" name="Houston-3D-image-Google-Earth" alt="3D image on Google Earth showing parts of Houston" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/srSPLq4XbNfVVzKqSeXwrj.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="823" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Beyond letting everyday folks geek out on geography, Google Earth is giving us AI-powered insights.

It's the standard — and required by law in some places, like the EU — but not all USB-C cables are made equal. That's why your charger probably needs an upgrade, and a cable with a screen might be the thing you didn't know you needed.</p><p>There are a ton of different specs supported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-cables-adapters">USB-C cables</a>, including Thunderbolt, USB4/USB5, Power Delivery, DisplayPort Alt Mode, and many more. Keeping track can be tricky, and using the wrong cable or power adapter could mean leaving charging speed or features on the table. To get the most out of your device, you need the right charging equipment.</p><p>I bought a USB-C cable with a screen from a random, no-name brand three years ago, mostly expecting it to be a gimmick. After all, I paid less than $10 for it, and had almost zero faith it would do what it claimed to. Fast forward to 2025, and the cheap cable I bought with a screen in 2022 is still working, and has been a game-changer for my charging habits. Here's why this cable changed my mind, and why you should get one too.</p><h2 id="a-basic-led-on-a-usb-c-cable-isn-t-overdoing-it-2">A basic LED on a USB-C cable isn't overdoing it</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="q4zWRThovvkU45jF7kP4GR" name="SooPii-USBC-Cable-1" alt="A SooPii USB-C cable connected to a power bank and a MacBook Air." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/q4zWRThovvkU45jF7kP4GR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Charging speed is arguably more important than battery life. Yes, having a long-lasting phone, tablet, or laptop is great, but it can be even better when a device supports fast charging. Some phones, like OnePlus devices in China, support impressive 100W charging speeds — or better. Even the latest iPhones, Google Pixel phones, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Samsung Galaxy phones</a> can do better than the 5W or 10W speeds of old.</p><p>The problem is, you won't get those handy top speeds by using any old power source and cable. Often, the cables included in the box with your device won't even cut it — you might need a USB-C cable or power adapter that supports faster speeds. Without a USB-C cable with a screen, you can't really tell which part of the charging system is the root of the issue.</p><p>That's why I exclusively carry <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Braided-Charging-Display-MacBook-Samsung/dp/B09HC4K3KP/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">this USB-C cable from SooPii. </a>It has a tiny, LED screen that shows the exact wattage your device is accepting from a power source. With it, I can figure out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/summer-travel-guide-2025-charging-accessories">which wall plugs or power banks</a> are actually giving my devices enough power. I use compact Anker Nano power adapters for charging my phone and earbuds, for instance, and save higher-wattage <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-anker-power-banks">Anker</a> and UGREEN adapters for tablets and laptops.</p><p>Some included wall plugs simply get disposed of because they aren't capable of delivering enough power. Without a USB-C cable with a display, I was flying blind, not knowing which power adapters or devices were charging funky. Now I have a bit more insight, and I didn't have to pay a premium for it — this cable has been consistently priced at around $8 and has lasted me years.</p><p>If you're in the market for a USB-C cable upgrade, don't scoff at ones with an LED screen. I thought it was a gimmick at first, but they quickly won me over.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="98aaa69d-ffbb-4571-ab92-c3e83cbd5b47">            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Braided-Charging-Display-MacBook-Samsung/dp/B09HC4K3KP" data-model-name="SooPii 100W USB-C cable"><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UMTpf4C3oqj6vbFwNZ3vbb.jpg' alt="A black SooPii USB-C cable with an LED against a white background."></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">SooPii 100W USB-C cable</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>An essential charging cable</strong></em></p><p>At under $10, getting a USB-C charging cable with an LED screen and 100W power delivery is impressive.

It features an 11-inch 2K LCD display, which is both crisp and vibrant, despite not being an OLED panel.</p><p>There's also a decent amount of power under the hood, thanks to the Kompanio 838 paired with 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. You might find yourself bumping up against the storage limits sooner rather than later, but as long as you make the most out of Google Drive, you should be fine.</p><p>On top of that, Lenovo includes the detachable Keyboard Cover in the box, which isn't entirely unexpected, but still nice to see. The only thing you won't find included is the Lenovo USI Pen, but if you already have a USI stylus, then you're in the clear anyway.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="qBCZQGck6eqjpGgEbLVvq" name="acer-chromebook-516-ge-16x9-alt.jpg" alt="Goldeneye on Acer Chromebook 516 GE 16x9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qBCZQGck6eqjpGgEbLVvq.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>But what if you want something more traditional, while still being different from the rest of the pack?

The retractable USB-C cable means you don't have to dig around in your bag to locate a cable, and it does an effective job charging devices at up to 67W.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You want more than two USB-C charging ports.</p><p>I used all the power banks Baseus released until now, and the Enercore shares a similar design with reliable build quality. The blue design is a little more distinctive than the gunmetal grey that's standard on most power banks, and while it picks up smudges, it isn't too glossy.</p><p>There's a built-in panel that shows remaining battery level, and the main attraction is the retractable USB-C cable that's tucked into the top of the Enercore. It doesn't stick out, and the USB-C connector has a magnet that ensures it stays attached to the chassis when you don't need the cable.</p><p>The cable goes up to 2.3 feet when fully extended, and it has four different lengths, so if you've got your phone next to the power bank, you don't need to extend it all the way. The flat cable has a tangle-free design, and it has been reliable in the week I used it — I tested it with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">9 Pro XL</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x200-ultra-review">Vivo X200 Ultra</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">X200 Pro</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review">Honor Magic V3</a>.</p><p>The retractable cable delivers up to a 67W charge over the USB PD protocol, and it has the standard power profiles: 5V/3A (15W), 9V/3A (27W), 12V/3A (36W), 15V/3A (45W), and 20V/3.35A (67W). The 20,000mAh battery ensures you can easily charge phones twice, and it delivers an efficiency of just over 60% — a decent showing in this category.</p><p>In addition to the retractable cable, you get a standard USB-C slot that can be used to charge a secondary device at up to 45W. This ports acts as the input, so you'll have to plug in a cable to charge the internal 20,000mAh battery. I didn't see any issues with overheating or charging various phones and accessories, and the Enercore has been just as reliable as its immediate rivals.</p><p>It is a decent recommendation at $59, but with the deal <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Baseus-Enercore-20000mAh-Retractable-Essential/dp/B0F3X1DLTD">bringing the price down to $44</a>, there's just no reason not to pick it up if you're interested in a new power bank.</p> ]]></dc:content>

But it’s not just shedding size—it's also rumored to be getting a durability upgrade, with better protection against both dust and water than the last model or any other foldables out there.</p><p>Following up on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>, the next-gen model might hit a big milestone—an IP68 rating, if a new report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-hinge" target="_blank">Android Headlines</a> is to be believed. If true, it’d be the first foldable to fully lock out dust and survive a splash, which is a pretty major first.</p><p>For anyone curious, IP ratings break down like this: the first number tells you how dustproof a device is, and the second one covers water resistance.</p><h2 id="foldables-dirty-little-secret-2">Foldables’ dirty little secret</h2><p>Most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">fan-favorite foldables</a> so far—like the Pixel 9 Pro Fold—only had IPX8, which means they’re good with water but not officially dustproof.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3vdxMY2tqLQZFRre938Rw4" name="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review-4.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold on fence railing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3vdxMY2tqLQZFRre938Rw4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Right now, Samsung holds the durability crown in the foldable segment, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> rocking IP48 ratings. But with the Galaxy Z Fold 7 aiming for IP68 and launching in July, Samsung could beat Google to the punch, since the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is tipped to land in August.</p><p>Durability isn’t the only upgrade on deck. Google’s also reworking the hinge on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold. That tweak should shrink the bezel around it and make room for a slightly bigger outer screen (6.4 inches vs. 6.3). The result is a slimmer build that not only feels better in your hand but also puts it right in the ring with Samsung’s Fold 7.</p><p>Google doesn’t seem obsessed with making the thinnest foldable, but the Pixel 10 Pro Fold should still be noticeably trimmer than last year’s model, and tougher at that. So even if it’s not breaking records, it’s shaping up to be a solid step forward.</p> ]]></dc:content>

While the chip's NPU can run up to "59 trillion operations per second (TOPS)," a noted 39% boost over <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-exynos-2400-comeback">the 2400</a> regarding AI, a big step arrives for its CPU. According to Samsung, the Exynos 2500's CPU features a 10-core structure (1+7+2).</p><p>The Korean OEM attributes its 15% boost in big core performance capabilities to the use of the "ultra-modern" Arm Cortex-X925 core.</p><p>Thanks to this, Samsung says the Exynos 2500 is capable of running "heavier apps" simultaneously without worry (and likely without causing too much strain on the phone). Graphics are important, especially when you're looking for a good flagship phone for mobile gaming. Samsung says it utilizes the fourth-generation Xclipse 950 GPU with the latest Exynos SoC.</p><p>It's also partnered with AMD to utilize its RDNA 3 architecture (again) for improved rendering speeds and hardware-accelerated ray tracing in games. Samsung adds in a separate note that it has boosted the available frames per second (FPS) in games by 28% with ray tracing enabled, a feature that typically demands a lot from a piece of hardware.</p><h2 id="the-next-gen-exynos-is-here-2">The next-gen Exynos is here</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1369px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:42.29%;"><img id="ZR98tdbu9ewtyYHiWCHrNe" name="samsung-exynos-2500-launch" alt="The Exynos 2500 brings notable AI improvements thanks to its upgraded NPU." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZR98tdbu9ewtyYHiWCHrNe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1369" height="579" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Other than the larger upgrades, Samsung detailed some of the smaller (yet equally important) specs for the Exynos 2500. Similar to the Exynos 2400, the 2500 supports 4K resolution displays at 120Hz. Moreover, its specs state the chip can support 8K resolution video recording at 30fps and 8K/60fps recordings.</p><p>Regarding photographs, Samsung says the chip can support a single (primary) camera at 320MP maximum. It also adds single camera 1080p/30fps and dual camera 64MP plus 32MP support.</p><p>Specifications include LPDDR5X memory support and UFS 4.0 storage.</p><p>The Exynos 2500 SoC's arrival comes after Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-fe-exynos-2500-impact-rumors">reportedly struggled with the chip's development</a>. In March, there were apparently uncertainties behind the chip's "production plan." As a result, it was rumored that Samsung <em>could </em>have to delay one of its devices.</p><p>More than that, Samsung's official debut of the Exynos 2500 comes at a time when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-z-flip-7-exynos-2500-chip-usage-rumored">there are rumors</a> of the Galaxy Z Flip 7 using the chip in May. Those rumors claimed the Flip 7 would do so in "most" places. So, it seems Samsung will explore a dual-chip strategy like it has done with devices previously. Speculation states regions like India and South Korea might use the Exynos 2500.</p><p>Other countries like the U.S., Canada, and China might pick up Qualcomm's chip, instead.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

That is, unless I go ahead and buy the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Razr-Unlocked-256GB-Camera/dp/B0F49DS7GH"><strong>Motorola Razr Plus 2025 for $300 off</strong></a> right now! But I may try to hold out for something even better.</p><p>I'm ready to hop on the foldable phone train. As a runner, I'm accustomed to the annoyance of gripping my slab phone for long workouts.

But a brand new phone isn't likely to have the best deals outside of carrier contracts and trade-ins; if I want to pay outright for one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">best foldable phones</a>, the Razr 2025 series seems like the best bet.

The Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 chip with 4GB more RAM is closer to flagship-quality speed, and the Victus protection on the cover display makes it more likely to survive a drop.</p><p>On the other hand, its 4,000mAh battery capacity isn't the best; I've gotten accustomed to my long-lived <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">Pixel 9a</a> with 5,100mAh capacity, and I wouldn't want my phone dying on me mid-hike or run.</p><p>I may want to hold out for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Motorola Razr Ultra 2025</a>, which has even <em>faster</em> performance, extra battery capacity with 68W charging, and the best peak brightness of 3,000 nits for the cover display. Too bad it's currently $1,169, even with a 10% discount! That's out of my price range, so Prime Day 2025 will need to come through with a massive deal.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4036px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="oqRYFdM42GqzZDdcjwbkrB" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-review-26" alt="Moto AI options on the Razr Ultra 2025 cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oqRYFdM42GqzZDdcjwbkrB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4036" height="2270" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The main reason I haven't bought a clamshell foldable before now is that I'm worried about longevity and durability. I appreciate that the Razr series is water resistant, but all it takes is some dust to mess up the inner display. Plus, all three models get <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-software-update-support">OS updates to Android 18</a>, so I'm hesitant to spend flagship-level money on the Razr Ultra when it won't stay on the cutting edge of features for long.</p><p>That's why I may decide to copy Brady and go for the base Motorola Razr 2025. Despite its downgrades compared to the Plus, I appreciate that it's more compact in hand and gets better battery life.</p><p>The Motorola Razr 2025 is normally $699, so getting the Plus for the same price right now is pretty great. But if the base model falls by a couple of hundred dollars for Prime Day — combined with a trade-in deal — and I can get this phone for the same price as a smartwatch? That would be pretty darn amazing.</p><p>So ultimately, I'm holding out for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/amazon-prime-day">Prime Day 2025</a> in the hopes of getting a great foldable deal! If the Razr isn't cheap enough, maybe Samsung will be trying to clear out stock on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>, and I can save on that instead.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The Galaxy Watch 8's design sports a moderate black border/bezel around the face's circumference. The renders also show two physical buttons on one side.</p><p>Things take a turn when it comes to the Classic variant, renders show the alleged Galaxy Watch 8 Classic in a rugged and thicker, silver and black colorway, sporting what looks like a rotating bezel. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-gear/massive-galaxy-watch-8-classic-leak-all-but-confirms-its-squircle-look">Previous leaks </a>suggest that the Classic variant will supposedly arrive in a single size (47mm), with a 1.5-inch display, and will have a 450mAh battery capacity.</p><p>As for the Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025, which we've been hearing a lot lately, it could show up in a deep blue colorway with a smoother silver bezel surrounding the dial. It remains unclear if this watch will have a rotating bezel, as it seems to have a much smoother outer bezel without the ridges. The renders show the watch will possess the same two physical buttons seen on the other two models and an additional smaller orange button on one side.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming smartwatch, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p> ]]></dc:content>

Pre-orders kicked off shortly after the livestream concluded, and as expected, AYANEO has already met the "target goal" for its latest handheld.</p><p>Unlike the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocket-s-review">Pocket S</a>, AYANEO is taking a different route with its offerings this time around. We still have the Pocket S2, with either 8GB or 12GB of RAM and up to 256GB of storage.

However, the S2 Pro will sport a larger 10,000mAh battery (compared to 8,000mAh), support up to 60W PD charging, come in a 16GB/512GB configuration, and sport a detachable D-pad.</p><p>The last bit was even more surprising than AYANEO introducing a "Pro" version, as it's not often we see easily interchangeable parts on handhelds. However, the company has a bit of experience in this area, as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ayaneo.com/product/AYANEO-3">AYANEO 3</a> launched earlier this year, featuring swappable control modules.

For many, a pair of truly wireless (TWS) earbuds or headphones is an essential that is carried with them every day. It makes sense — you want to watch videos, play games, listen to music, and generally hear audio without disturbing those around you. But if you only have one pair of headphones or earbuds for every situation, you're doing it wrong.</p><p>For a complete audio setup, you need three pairs of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">headphones and earbuds</a>. One pair of wireless earbuds for everyday listening, another for sleep or working out, and finally, a pair of over-ear headphones. If you have one pair of headphones in each of these three categories, you'll be covered for every type of situation.</p><p>You see, headphones and earbuds aren't a one-size-fits-all solution for all times and activities. Sometimes, you just need the right tool for the job. That tool could prioritize sound quality, comfort, fit, active noise-canceling, or battery life depending on the situation. You can cover all these needs with three pairs, and here are the ones I'd recommend.</p><h2 id="everyday-wear-samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-2">Everyday wear: Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="aLUy8iuHciU2NHQBpkHwui" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-ui-8-beta-1-auracast" alt="Using a pair of Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro to connect to an Auracast stream running on One UI 8 on a Samsnug Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aLUy8iuHciU2NHQBpkHwui.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The first pair of headphones everyone should own is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds" target="_blank">a pair of truly wireless earbuds</a> for everyday wear. These are the kind of headphones most people own, and for good reason — they're an essential. With a slim profile, decent sound quality, and great battery life, you can throw these in a pocket or bag and forget about them. When you need personal audio, you'll have it, even in times you weren't expecting to need headphones.</p><p>For most Android users, the pair of TWS earbuds to get is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro</a>. They get a lot of things right while often selling for less than their $250 list price. For starters, they're the only pair of earbuds I've tested that can match the AirPods Pro 2 in terms of active noise-canceling. Additionally, I <em>prefer</em> the sound quality of the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro to that of Apple's popular earbuds.</p><p>The sound signature feels fuller and louder, with more powerful bass that doesn't overshadow the rest of the sound you hear. You'll have plenty of battery life, with six hours in the earbuds with ANC on and a total of 26 hours with the charging case. Speaking of the case, it plugs in with USB-C and has wireless charging available too.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2tmbQWqBtYZjYeRixp3AdW" name="galaxy-buds3-pro-buds-alone.jpg" alt="Galaxy Buds 3 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2tmbQWqBtYZjYeRixp3AdW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You can get the Galaxy Wearable app on any Android phone, so Galaxy Buds 3 Pro owners will get a nearly complete feature set even if they don't own a Samsung device.

Truly wireless earbuds designed for everyday wear just aren't built for intense runs, gym workouts, or fitness activities. They lack the secure fit that is needed for a good workout, and some don't have IP ratings that protect against sweat and rain.</p><p>That's why, if you listen to music or podcasts while working out, you <em>need</em> a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones-working-out">dedicated pair of workout earbuds</a>.

In terms of sound, bigger is better. Earbuds are limited by the small size of their audio drivers and simply cannot match the sound quality of headphones with larger drivers. That's why if you want the best sound, best comfort, and best ANC, you'll need to pick up a pair of over-ears.</p><p>There are so many great options, from brands like Apple, Sony, and Bose, but my go-to favorite is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sonos-ace-review">Sonos Ace</a>. They're not the best sounding; however, they nail the essentials. Comfort is stellar with memory foam cushions and vegan leather coverings, meaning I can listen for hours without needing to take them off. That makes Sonos Ace perfect for long listening sessions, perhaps like on a plane.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="99856VeUPkeNYDJPT9VRKU" name="Sonos-Ace-both-colors.jpg" alt="Sonos Ace headphones in black and soft white." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/99856VeUPkeNYDJPT9VRKU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Aside from the benefits that come with a comfortable fit and a slim and light profile, Sonos Ace also sound excellent.

If you build out this audio kit over the course of a few years, you'll set up a nice upgrade schedule so you're not spending a bunch of money all at once.</p><p>You can also go for budget options in each category to match your ideal price point. For instance, you can get <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/beats-solo-buds-review">Beats Solo Buds</a> as a pair of cheap everyday earbuds for as low as $50 with a good sale.

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I've tested the Sonos Ace regularly in the year since the headphones were first released, and truth be told, they're not perfect. The $449 retail price tag is steep compared to some members of the competition, for starters. Sonos does get a lot right in its first pair of over-ear headphones, including industry-leading comfort. If they were priced about $100 cheaper, they'd be an absolute slam-dunk buy, and that's why a deal from Walmart caught my eye.</p><p>The retailer is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1943169/565706/9383?subId1=ac-us-1122730035479278889&sharedId=hawk&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSonos-Ace-Wireless-Noise-Canceling-Headphones-Black%2F5902797595%3F" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">slashing $117 off the usual price of Sonos Ace</a>, bringing the cost down to $332.29. That's now significantly less than Sony's WH-1000XM6, Bose's QuietComfort Ultra, and Apple's AirPods Max. It's also only a bit more than you can find the last-gen Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones for at a discount.</p><p>With all this in mind, anyone in the market for a pair of quality over-ear headphones should consider snatching up the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sonos-ace-review">Sonos Ace</a> at just over $300, and I'll tell you why.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="2f72eb08-eef2-4019-99e7-512f93b480ab" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Sonos Ace:  $449.00" data-dimension48="Sonos Ace:  $449.00" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="4uieFX5MgKGvbDAahtBHrG" name="Sonos-Ace-Render-Square" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4uieFX5MgKGvbDAahtBHrG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Sonos Ace: </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Sonos-Ace-Wireless-Noise-Canceling-Headphones-Black/5902797595?" target="_blank" rel="sponsored" data-dimension112="2f72eb08-eef2-4019-99e7-512f93b480ab" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Sonos Ace:  $449.00" data-dimension48="Sonos Ace:  $449.00" data-dimension25=""><del><u>$449.00</u></del><u> </u><u><strong>$332.29 at Walmart</strong></u></a></p><p>Sonos made (sound)waves when it launched the Ace last year, its first pair of over-ear headphones. With a comfort-first design, quality ANC, and excellent sound quality, the Sonos Ace have turned out to be a popular pair of headphones. However, their price left a bit to be desired, and that's why Walmart slashing over $100 off the MSRP is huge. </p><p><strong>Price comparison:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sonos-Ace-Wireless-Headphones-Cancellation/dp/B0CYHGTMNH/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">Amazon - $388.53</a>| <a href="https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/sonos-ace" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">Sonos - $449.00</a><a class="view-deal button" href="" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="2f72eb08-eef2-4019-99e7-512f93b480ab" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Sonos Ace:  $449.00" data-dimension48="Sonos Ace:  $449.00" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you care about stylish design and comfort; you are familiar with Sonos products and have ecosystem hardware already; you want solid sound quality and active noise canceling.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you prefer Apple, Sony, or Bose noise-canceling; you expect Sonos Ace to pair with your Sonos speakers and equipment; you need the lightest pair of over-ears.</p><h2 id="ready-for-the-long-haul-2">Ready for the long haul</h2><p>Sonos Ace are the most comfortable pair of headphones I've ever worn, and you can overlook almost any of the Ace's minor shortcomings because of this. For the earcups and headband, Sonos uses memory foam cushions on the inside and a vegan leather covering on the outside. When you put Sonos Ace on, the cushions will conform to your individual head shape and retain their position for optimal comfort.</p><p>In a practical sense, this means that I can wear the Sonos Ace on a long-haul flight without ever feeling discomfort. That isn't something that I can say about the AirPods Max or the Dyson OnTrac. It also means that the 312-gram weight of the Sonos Ace isn't a problem, despite these headphones being heavier than competing options from Bose and Sony.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="gbEAWBdLUuQBCHyMwk7nPK" name="Sonos-Ace-cups-face-up.jpg" alt="Sonos Ace headphones folded flat and ear cups facing up." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gbEAWBdLUuQBCHyMwk7nPK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In terms of music listening, Sonos fans, be warned — these aren't like your Sonos speakers at home. Sonos Ace only use Wi-Fi connectivity for one thing, and that's connecting to an Arc soundbar and an iOS device <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/sonos-ace-dual-listening-truecinema-beefier-sound-realistic-update">for watching movies and TV shows</a>. For everything else, the Ace will use Bluetooth 5.4.</p><p>Sonos Ace are the only Sonos product that behaves this way, as they usually connect via Wi-Fi, but this is typical for Bluetooth headphones. Still, connectivity and sound quality are excellent, as there are two 40mm drivers right next to your ears that provide a surprisingly full spatial experience. You get dynamic head tracking, spatial audio, and Dolby Atmos support on the Sonos Ace, all of which are optional.</p><p>In terms of raw sound quality, Sonos Ace is all about balance, as you get a nice and even soundstage distribution. You won't hear overpowering bass or miss out on subtle high-end sounds, like cymbals. If you do like a bass-heavy sound, the AirPods Max provide that best, but I tend to like Sonos' balance here.</p><h2 id="the-sonos-ace-is-a-steal-at-more-than-100-off-and-you-shouldn-t-pass-on-it-2">The Sonos Ace is a steal at more than $100 off, and you shouldn't pass on it</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="99856VeUPkeNYDJPT9VRKU" name="Sonos-Ace-both-colors.jpg" alt="Sonos Ace headphones in black and soft white." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/99856VeUPkeNYDJPT9VRKU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I have a collection of over-ear headphones at my disposal, and I use a few of them for different things.

However, it seems that Samsung might not cut back on its display for the FE, giving consumers a flagship experience in that regard.</p><p>In March, renderings of the alleged Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE surfaced, and it pretty much rocked a design <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-z-flip-7-fe-leaked-minty-design-renders-specs-rumors">we've all seen before</a>. The tab-reminiscent indent for the cameras, there's a chance the Flip FE will look like the Flip 6. Rumors purported the phone could have a 3.4-inch cover display and a 6.7-inch internal screen.</p><p>Those cameras could also be 50MP and 12MP.</p><p>There hasn't been much else about the Flip 7 FE, especially amid the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-alleged-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-leak-ahead-of-rumored-launch">Flip 7 and Fold 7 leaks recently</a>.

That means your screen grabs will finally keep all the juicy contrast and brightness from what you actually see on your display.</p><p>With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a>, real <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-16-hdr-screenshots-3528355/" target="_blank">HDR screenshots are finally here</a>. Now, when you snap a shot of any HDR content, it doesn’t lose that punch you see in the original image or video.</p><p>Instead of flattening the image, it now saves everything as a PNG packed with all the right metadata, including gain maps. So when you view it on a display that’s HDR-ready, what you see is exactly what was meant to be seen, not some washed-out version.</p><p>Back when most content was SDR, Android didn’t really need HDR screenshot support. But SDR has its limits, such as muted colors and weaker contrast. You’ve probably been there: you snap a shot of a super-detailed photo, only to check the screenshot and it looks flat, dull, maybe even washed out. That’s because standard screenshots default to SDR, which just can’t keep up with all the color and brightness HDR brings to the table.</p><h2 id="hdr-screenshots-are-finally-happening-2">HDR screenshots are (finally!) happening</h2><p>According to leaker Ice Universe, the latest One UI 8 ZYF7 beta—still limited to closed testing—adds support for HDR screenshots (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-is-bringing-hdr-screenshot-support-to-one-ui-8" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>). That’s a big step up from the old SDR-only screen captures.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">By the way, Samsung S25 Ultra One UI 8 ZYF7 (Android16 feature) supports screenshot HDR.

If this sticks through to the final One UI 8 release, your screenshots will keep all the bold colors and deep contrast that make HDR content pop.</p><p>Given that beta features are always a bit of a gamble, there is no guarantee they’ll make it to the final build. But seeing HDR screenshot support show up in One UI 8’s closed beta is a solid sign.</p> ]]></dc:content>

There really hasn't been an option that provides both, but I think the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 is exactly what we've been looking for.</p><p>I was lucky enough to be invited to a briefing for the device launch, alongside a bunch of other creators and executives from both Google and Lenovo. We were told about a lot of new features that are on the way for all Chromebook owners, such as "Select to search with Lens" and "Text Capture."</p><p>It's been rather difficult to be excited about Chromebook hardware over the past eight months or so. There was such a significant gap between device launches earlier this year that I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/where-have-all-the-chromebooks-gone">pondered</a> whether consumer Chromebooks were on their way out the door. However, all of that excitement has come rushing back with the debut of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/lenovo-chromebook-plus-14-advanced-hybrid-ai-powerhouse-launch">Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14</a>.</p><h2 id="power-performance-and-features-2">Power, performance, and features</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="4nGXobJSQyJnSzaSGbXAAo" name="lenovo-chromebook-plus-14-hands-on-8" alt="Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 on a desk connected to a monitor" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4nGXobJSQyJnSzaSGbXAAo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What drives that excitement is a few things. First and foremost, we have the MediaTek Kompanio Ultra 910 at the helm, making this the first Kompanio Ultra-powered Chromebook. As you might suspect, this is an ARM-based processor, which should mean we'll have excellent battery life, with Lenovo claiming the Chromebook Plus 14 will last for up to 17 hours on a single charge.</p><p>That's not completely unheard of in the Chromebook world, but it's impressive considering that the Kompanio Ultra 910 features both a dGPU and NPU. What this amounts to is an on-device Gemini experience that is said to be 32% faster and 44% more efficient. These aren't insignificant improvements; we're looking at the type of boost that was last seen when the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apple-m1-chip-helping-apple-expand-its-brand-lock">Apple M1</a> was introduced.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="j2J7TyN7RUhn9VL5fHMT9o" name="lenovo-chromebook-plus-14-hands-on-mediatek-kompanio-ultra-sticker" alt="MediaTek Kompanio Ultra logo on Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/j2J7TyN7RUhn9VL5fHMT9o.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When the various demos were being performed, the Chromebook Plus 14 didn't break a sweat. And the thing that I kept reminding myself of is that more and more of these features are being handled on-device, as opposed to being offloaded to the cloud. I'm excited about the prospect of having access to more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> features, even if I'm not connected to the internet.</p><p>Unique to the Chromebook Plus 14 are "Smart grouping" and "Image editing in the Gallery app." As someone who has at least 20-30 tabs open at any given time, I breathed a sigh of relief during the presentation.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item"

It screams "premium" from top to bottom, starting with the display.</p><p>We have a 14-inch 2K OLED display that looks fantastic, with great viewing angles and vivid colors. There's even a slight protrusion along the top, where you'll find the admittedly disappointing 5MP webcam.

Oh, and I was happy to see the return of the Quick Insert Key, something that debuted with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review">Galaxy Chromebook Plus</a>, but has yet to be added to other Chromebooks.</p><p>If there's one concern I have here, it's with the trackpad. Apple spoiled me with its Magic Trackpad, and outside of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/hp-dragonfly-pro-chromebook-review">HP Dragonfly Pro</a>, I've yet to find anything that comes close. While it didn't feel like the Chromebook Plus 14 was using a glass trackpad, it also didn't feel very cheap like some of the other options out there. So this is something I'll be paying closer attention to once my review unit arrives.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="3URuo4rCdaEbzDXa4oJ8Ao" name="lenovo-chromebook-plus-14-hands-on-9" alt="Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 close-up on keyboard, trackpad, and fingerprint scanner" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3URuo4rCdaEbzDXa4oJ8Ao.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The last thing I wanted to touch on regarding the design is the bottom casing. While aluminum adorns the lid and keyboard deck, we have plastic on the bottom, and it might look familiar to those who owned a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/pixelbook-go-second-opinion-review">Pixelbook Go</a>.</p><p>Neither Google nor Lenovo explicitly came out and said that it was inspired by the Pixelbook Go, but it's pretty obvious that's the case. Lenovo did share that it opted for this design because it makes it easier to carry around the Chromebook Plus 14 without feeling like it is going to slip out of your hands. No matter the reason, it's kind of cool to see, if not just for adding another layer of uniqueness to this device.</p><h2 id="this-could-be-the-change-chromebooks-needed-2">This could be the "change" Chromebooks needed</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="3qihZzf3Ve962cjz9wYk6o" name="lenovo-chromebook-plus-14-hands-on-6" alt="Generating images using Gemini on Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3qihZzf3Ve962cjz9wYk6o.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Ultimately, I think what makes me so excited about the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 is that this <em>might</em> just be the "Apple M1 moment" we've been waiting for. Lenovo and Google have been working on this specific device for some time, culminating in a Chromebook that is elegant, powerful, and cuts very few corners.</p><p>I already know it's not <em>perfect</em>, as we should definitely have something better than a 5MP webcam. Plus, offering a version with 256GB of storage is a good start, but I do wish there were configurations with more storage. There's a specific reason as to why (<em>cough</em> AI <em>cough</em>), but I'll save those thoughts for later.</p><p>Nevertheless, on the surface, Lenovo and Google checked most, if not all, of the important boxes for a flagship Chromebook Plus device. I'm seriously excited to spend more time with the Chromebook Plus 14 and will report back soon with my final thoughts, once my review unit arrives and I can dig in.</p> ]]></dc:content>

As a bit of house cleaning, the company states the laptop is available with a 14-inch display. The latest Chromebook Plus focuses on professionals, creators, and students, delivering a premium feel throughout the device. Lenovo states this display features a 2K resolution.</p><p>Design-wise, the post highlights the laptop's minimalist design elements, its aluminum chassis, and a backlit keyboard.</p><p>Lenovo touts its Chromebook Plus' touchpad, which should provide a more seamless scrolling approach. On the front of the laptop is a 5MP webcam that also features a physical privacy shutter. Those looking to multitask a little might find the laptop's support for two external displays at 4K resolution useful.</p><h2 id="ai-for-here-and-ai-to-go-2">AI for here and AI to go</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1062px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.50%;"><img id="HXsk4FChWXRzxjZDwpT2MR" name="lenovo-chromebook-plus-overview" alt="The Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14's overview, highlighting its flagship MediaTek chip and loads of AI software." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HXsk4FChWXRzxjZDwpT2MR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1062" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Lenovo)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Lenovo and Google claim this Chromebook Plus is extremely powerful in terms of its AI capabilities. Even Lenovo's executive director and general manager of Chromebooks, Benny Zhang, said, "Whether you are an executive needing AI performance through the day, an artist wishing to create out the studio, or an everday user looking to browse, learn or play, this premium device is your perfect everyday companion."</p><p>What's empowering this laptop is MediaTek's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek/mediatek-kompanio-ultra-next-gen-chromebook-plus-announced">Kompanio Ultra processor</a>, the brand's flagship CPU. This enabled the companies to build <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> directly into the 14-inch Chromebook Plus by Lenovo. With the AI available in the device's shelf, Gemini brings "Select to Search" backed by Lens, so users can find items on their screen without switching tabs/windows. Text Capture comes in as a quick note-taker, grabbing important dates or blurbs from your documents and popping them into Calendar or Docs.</p><p>Moreover, Lenovo states this Chromebook Plus features an upgraded variant of "Help me Read," simplifying heavy, jargon-filled text with the option to ask follow-up questions.</p><p>On Google's side, the company introduced two exclusive features that you'll only find on Lenovo's new Chromebook Plus: Smart Grouping and AI Image Editing. When using the former, the laptop's on-device AI will "intelligently" understand and organize your tabs and documents into like-minded groups. For your images, the AI Image editor enters for the Gallery app, letting users remove backgrounds and turn photos into stickers.</p><h2 id="ready-when-you-are-2">Ready when you are</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:900px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="bg5t3bicYq7xCfxYDmJWEb" name="lenovo-chromebook-plus-14-official-render" alt="The Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bg5t3bicYq7xCfxYDmJWEb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="900" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Lenovo)</span></figcaption></figure><p>According to Lenovo, their latest Chromebook Plus "can be available with Google's Chrome Education upgrade." This lets schools and IT admins manage the ChromeOS and tailor it to their specific needs.</p><p>The laptop has a lot going on under the hood, but portability and longevity are the name of the game, so here's a battery that fits. Lenovo states its laptop is outfitted with a 17-hour battery in a package that weighs roughly 2.6 pounds. More than that, it should remain strong enough to handle multiple tasks, thanks to 16GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage. The device also supports Wi-Fi 7 connectivity.</p><p>The Lenovo Chromebook Plus is available today (June 23), starting at $649 through your expected consumer/commercial channels.</p><ul><li><strong>Laptop deals: </strong><a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-us/category/laptop-deals"><u><strong>Dell</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/promo/laptop-and-computer-deals"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/laptops/1089430"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/d/deals/laptops/?tabkey=Laptop%20Deals"><u><strong>Lenovo</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/slp/weekly-deals/laptops"><u><strong>HP</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.newegg.com/PCs-Laptops/EventSaleStore/ID-1071"><u><strong>Newegg</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Laptops-Todays-Deals-Computers-Tablets/s?rh=n%3A565108%2Cp_n_deal_type%3A23566064011"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Rokid has been around for the better part of a decade, but the Chinese brand is just now starting to break out into the global market.</p><p>The Max 2 is key to that vision; the AR glasses use a Micro-OLED panel that delivers a 215-inch screen anywhere you go, and you get decent built-in sound and connectivity via USB-C. But where the Max 2 stands out is the design; Rokid did all the right things in this area, and the level of adjustability you get with these glasses is much better than the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/rayneo-air-3s-review">RayNeo Air 3S</a>, which I tested earlier in the year.</p><p>So if you need AR glasses to consume entertainment on the go or need a portable screen to level up your Steam Deck gaming sessions, Rokid's Max 2 is one of the best options available today.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-rokid-max-2-pricing-and-availability"><span>Rokid Max 2: Pricing and availability</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5129px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="d3vT8JRgsn8wFKCk3iYrTn" name="Rokid Max 2 AR Glasses" alt="Rokid Max 2 AR Glasses review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/d3vT8JRgsn8wFKCk3iYrTn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5129" height="2889" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Rokid's Max 2 glasses made their debut in Q1 2025, and they're now available in select global markets.

As much as I like RayNeo's products, they require plenty of adjustments to dial in on the fit, and that's thankfully not an issue on the Max 2. The glasses have a plastic chassis that's relatively light at 76g, and the frame has a decent amount of adjustability to it.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="yuYdtbJBWzhTuJpCCEkESn" name="Rokid Max 2 AR Glasses" alt="Rokid Max 2 AR Glasses review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yuYdtbJBWzhTuJpCCEkESn.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5000" height="2816" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4971px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="W7f5H2QJAxer73fLDF5eCn" name="Rokid Max 2 AR Glasses" alt="Rokid Max 2 AR Glasses review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/W7f5H2QJAxer73fLDF5eCn.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4971" height="2800" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Where the design truly shines is the customizability. The Max 2 comes vision adjustment, giving you granular control over the focus of the Micro-OLED panel according to your eyesight. This makes a huge difference in usability, and it ensures the Max 2 delivers a crystal-clear picture at all times.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5115px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="9tTbnwWkAceWB7mEZvPXJn" name="Rokid Max 2 AR Glasses" alt="Rokid Max 2 AR Glasses review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9tTbnwWkAceWB7mEZvPXJn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5115" height="2881" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Honestly, after using these glasses for the better part of a month, I don't see myself going back to AR glasses that don't have this feature. You can use the built-in dials above the rim, and there's no fringing whatsoever once you adjust either lens. The nose bridge has soft pads that are comfortable, and I didn't see any fatigue even after using the Max 2 for well over an hour.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4778px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="Y5JkpCUaxJWJewN7h9h4Mn" name="Rokid Max 2 AR Glasses" alt="Rokid Max 2 AR Glasses review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Y5JkpCUaxJWJewN7h9h4Mn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4778" height="2691" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another positive is the coating on the front shade; it is sufficiently dark that it tunes out ambient light, allowing for a clearer picture. Basically, Rokid nailed all the basics here, and the Max 2 showcase the potential of AR glasses. On that note, there are controls under the right side of the frame, and the USB-C connector is located at the end of the left frame.</p><p>I didn't see any issues connecting the Max 2 to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x200-ultra-review">Vivo X200 Ultra</a>, Pixel 9 Pro Fold, Pixel 9 Pro XL, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a>, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-ipad-pro-m4-13-inch-long-term-review">iPad Pro M4</a>. The Sony Micro-OLED panel is a known quantity in this category, and it delivers good brightness levels and excellent image fidelity.

While it was confined to earbuds, the company  is debuting over-ear headphones dubbed Headphone 1. Ahead of the launch, we now have the first proper look at them, revealing their design.</p><p>The leak comes from multiple sources (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/06/20/nothing-headphone-1-leaks-show-off-unique-translucent-design-gallery/">9to5Google</a>), which showcases the alleged Headphone 1 in all its glory. The over-ear headphones, at first glance, appear to carry Nothing's signature translucent design.</p><div class="instagram-embed"><blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version="6" style="width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);"><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DLGDyP2s8X0/" target="_blank">A post shared by 𝙽𝚘𝚝𝚑𝚒𝚗𝚐 𝙱𝚕𝚘𝚐 (@nothing_fan_blog)</a></p><p>A photo posted by  on </p></blockquote></div><p>The shared images of the alleged Headphone 1 indicate that it will have a sizable ear cup featuring a rectangular or slightly squircle design around the corners. They will further feature translucent design, the elements of which were teased by the company for over the past few weeks.
