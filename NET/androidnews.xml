The specs are spectacular, but that's no secret. What's not being talked about as much as it should, however, is the diverse offering of textures and colors. We need to appreciate the many shapes and forms of all three devices.</p><p>You can have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-series-hands-on">Razr 2025</a> made of wood or one with a nylon-like woven fabric backside. Then there's the marvelous, luxurious marble imitation that oozes opulence and grandeur. It truly is a sensory delight.</p><p>Motorola is innovating the tactile sense of a phone.</p>

<h2 id="motorola-acknowledges-the-public-s-desire-for-fun-and-unique-designs-2">Motorola acknowledges the public's desire for fun and unique designs</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4064px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="koLWjXKCDwQYaL7Ksi9VWd" name="Motorola-Razr-2025-series" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 with the Razr Plus 2025 and Razr 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/koLWjXKCDwQYaL7Ksi9VWd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4064" height="2286" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Motorola is clearly having fun doing things its own way, just like the brand always has. In a world where Google is taking a leaf out of Samsung's bland book to give us the bar of soap that is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a">Pixel 9a</a>, Motorola is rebelling. It's such a legendary move, to be honest. I'd expect nothing less from the makers of the most iconic flip phone in the history of technology.</p><p>The Razr 2025 lineup consists of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/which-motorola-razr-2025-model-should-you-buy">Razr 2025, Razr Plus 2025, and Razr Ultra 2025</a>. The first and last models come in four colorways each, whereas the middle child is available in three finishes.</p><p>Motorola collaborated with Pantone to curate colors for every single color variant, and then meticulously decided to pair those shades with the right materials and finishes. The attention to detail and dedication to ensure that each variant is on the Pantone scale of standardized colors is admirable.</p><p>Leather-backed smartphones aren't new, and many brands like Xiaomi and OnePlus have colorways that offer this texture for their flagship phones. But there's usually one "unusual" option along with two or three other commonplace finishes like plastic or glass on the roster. With the Razr family, every single option brings something different to the table.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Q4uD6JrUXYHyJc2Us5C4se" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-hands-on-17" alt="Different colors of the Razr Ultra 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Q4uD6JrUXYHyJc2Us5C4se.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Introducing three phones in one go is already a risk, but offering four individual colors with unique textures for two of the three models is a big gamble. And it's not your average vegan leather, either—the Razr 2025 series comes in some seriously uncommon finishes.</p><p>For instance, there's the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/what-motorola-razr-ultra-2025-color-should-you-buy">Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 colorway</a> in Scarab that's made of Alcantara, the stuff used to line the insides of a Porche or Ferrari. They could've used any other type of synthetic material to get that soft matte look, but Alcantara is a high-grade material that offers improved durability and longevity. Not to mention, it looks and feels just as premium as it sounds.</p><p>And if you're an environmentalist or an avid adventurer with a penchant for nature, the Razr Ultra 2025 is also available in a gorgeous wooden option called Mountain Trail. It's literally a phone made with polished wooden bits incorporated into its core. What a lovely concept!</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4089px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hgU4hPwJptqeQeMjBMRSMe" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-hands-on-15" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 AI key" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hgU4hPwJptqeQeMjBMRSMe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4089" height="2300" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We get fun phones on and off, particularly futuristic-looking designs like Nothing's transparent shtick or that heavy gamer aesthetic that brands like ASUS and Red Magic favor. But beyond that, flagship brands like Apple, Samsung, and Google have all moved towards bland blocks of glass and metal with as little character and individuality as possible. I'm sick of it.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/why-google-pixel-9a-ditched-camera-bar">Pixel 9a losing its signature camera</a> bar was the straw that broke the camel's back for me. I'm tired of Samsung regurgitating the same tired designs year after year. This is not a trend; it's the death of creativity. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> did nothing to differentiate itself from its predecessor, visually speaking, and I've got a funny feeling the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> will be just as disappointingly predictable.</p>

<p>Frankly, it's refreshing to see a mainstream phone brand like Motorola doing things differently. I'm so glad they didn't commit such a crime against the Razr family.</p><p>From a business perspective, it's a really smart move too. Product differentiation is crucial when going up against well-established brands in the market. Motorola is slowly but surely building its own base of loyal customers whom the brand will certainly retain if it continues down this path.</p><p>If Samsung doesn't add uniquely distinguishable features to the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a>, Motorola will surely win the battle for the clamshell foldable pie of the smartphone market.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>All the conversation around Apple in India has centered around tariffs, and for good reason — the brand is aiming to move a bulk of its iPhone production out of China to India. Doing so will undoubtedly be time-consuming, and we'll need to wait and see if the factories assembling iPhones in India can handle the increased demand.</p>
<div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Hardwired</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5u6gVPowTCuSQ8NJeoktj7" name="lloyd-hardwired.png" caption="" alt="Android Central's LLoyd with a bionic eye" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5u6gVPowTCuSQ8NJeoktj7.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text">In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/hardwired">Hardwired</a>, AC Senior Editor Harish Jonnalagadda delves into all things hardware, including phones, audio products, storage servers, and networking gear.</p></div></div>
<p>Apple in general is enjoying a heady momentum in India, gaining sizeable market share on the back of strong sales. But what I like the most is the attention the brand is paying to Indian consumers on the software front; iOS 18.4 debuted a month ago, and while it doesn't bring much in the way of bold new features, it adds Indic language integration to the OS, and it is wonderful.</p><p>In typical Apple fashion, the brand took a while to add localization to iOS, but having used the feature over the last month, I can say with some confidence that it is a much better implementation than Android. I switched the system language to Telugu on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a> and Hindi on another device, and both languages have tight integration; it's great to see the attention to detail Apple lavished towards its localization efforts.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="mVyGfaT28hih9yH5dEhofa" name="iphone-indic-language-2" alt="iPhone 16 Pro Max running Telugu and Hindi languages within iOS 18.4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mVyGfaT28hih9yH5dEhofa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are still a few labels that show up in English — like Apple Intelligence — but everywhere else, you'll see Indic languages as standard. What's interesting about this is that all the sub-menus and details in utilities like Fitness and Health are also translated into Indic languages, and that makes it easier to understand key metrics like calories burned and activity data.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="uHNyTrrMGG7bA9QKyvaWda" name="iphone-indic-language-3" alt="iPhone 16 Pro Max running Telugu and Hindi languages within iOS 18.4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uHNyTrrMGG7bA9QKyvaWda.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Apple stuck to a standard notation in settings where it transliterated text into Telugu without changing the English naming — it's just that the alphabet has changed. Google does things a little differently where it translates the word into the source language, and it's not as easy to locate menus and sub-menus within settings because of that (at least for me).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="7mxm6AdJx7UvWWwL4W3qha" name="iphone-indic-language-6" alt="iPhone 16 Pro Max running Telugu and Hindi languages within iOS 18.4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7mxm6AdJx7UvWWwL4W3qha.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If anything, the only limitation I can think of is that Apple Intelligence isn't available with most Indic languages, so you miss out on most of the AI-assisted features. Other than that, Apple did a thorough job integrating most Indic languages into iOS, and it's refreshing to use the iPhone in my native language.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="DeNUh5ddzqpwHR6ETD6Nia" name="iphone-indic-language-4" alt="iPhone 16 Pro Max running Telugu and Hindi languages within iOS 18.4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DeNUh5ddzqpwHR6ETD6Nia.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While English literacy is high in India, the ability to use regional languages with an iPhone makes it that much more enticing. This should lead to a meaningful increase in sales, and I know one loyal Android user who's willing to switch to iOS as a result of this change. My dad has been using Android phones for the last decade — he's currently on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-apex-edition-review">OnePlus Open</a> — and while he likes using the device, he's run into several issues with Bluetooth connectivity and pairing with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-vs-watch-2">OnePlus Watch 2</a>.</p><p>I suggested he switch over to an iPhone several times in the past, but he's found iOS to be restrictive. But with the switch to Indic languages, he's interested in trying out the platform; he likes to type in Telugu and uses Gboard extensively, and the tight integration of local languages combined with the fact that Gboard is just as good on iOS as it is on Android was enough to get him at least intrigued about switching over.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="wUGjxDrGdcKkbEg7nvdVga" name="iphone-indic-language-5" alt="iPhone 16 Pro Max running Telugu and Hindi languages within iOS 18.4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wUGjxDrGdcKkbEg7nvdVga.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another plus point is the broader ecosystem. My dad is very active, and he likes using smartwatches; he's wanted something like the Apple Watch but on Android, and there just isn't something that has a similar design and feature-set. Now that he's moving to an iPhone (I'm giving him an iPhone 16), I'm setting him up with an Apple Watch, and I'm excited to see how he likes the platform.</p><p>On the whole, iOS 18.4 is a definite step in the right direction, and combined with the increased attention to the country and positioning its products aggressively, it's obvious that Apple is gaining considerable momentum.</p>

I plan to stick with my Lite subscription for the long haul. And only one thing would make it better: if Google worked Lite into its group and annual membership plans.</p><p>YouTube is apparently testing a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube/youtube-launches-new-two-person-premium-subscription-tier-for-select-countries">couples' Premium membership</a> in India, France, Taiwan, and Hong Kong, a nice two-person middle ground for people who can't take full advantage of the Family subscription for five people.</p><p>It could take months or years for this promotion to reach the U.S., if it comes here at all. But even if it does, Google has thus far only offered group rates for the full-price Premium plan with YouTube Music and all the bells and whistles.</p>

<p>My fiancée and I both stream way too much YouTube every day, from her Critical Role and cat videos to my Let's Plays. But no one else in our respective families cares all that much about YouTube, so a $23/month family Premium plan felt like overkill.</p><p>But a YouTube Premium Lite two-person plan? That we could easily fit into our budget! So I can only hope Google decides to offer a wider range of unconventional family plans soon.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1338px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="ELVgXVYhtf64SvhbQDTEXi" name="YouTube-Premium-vs-Premium-Lite" alt="The YouTube Premium chart showing the different Premium and Premium Lite features, with "Pick a membership that fits you" at the top.

<p>I don't have official stats on YouTube ad frequency, but ever since I let my Premium subscription lapse after the 2023 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-raising-price-of-youtube-premium">price hike</a>, it has sure <em>felt</em> like Google has piled in more ads per video in the past year than I ever remember seeing.</p><p>I still tense up when I click a thumbnail, my brain trained to expect 5–15 seconds of garbage as I wait frantically for the Skip ad pop-up. Skip ahead a minute? That's usually an ad. Pause the video for five minutes to check on my screaming cat? Time to auto-reload the page with a fresh ad!</p><p>That's why Premium Lite has been such a simple joy, easily worth the $8/month.</p><p>I let my original Premium subscription lapse because I couldn't justify $14/month to remove ads when I already had another preferred music app. It didn't matter how good YouTube Music was; I just wanted the <em>choice</em> to bundle it in or not.</p><p>When I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-made-a-mistake-with-youtube-premium">made this argument</a>, I usually got one of two responses: I was an idiot for not switching to YT Music — even my managing editor bullies me about this — or I was a moron for not using Brave, Pie, NewPipe, or other workarounds to avoid ads for free.</p>

<p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-will-finally-uncouple-youtube-premium-and-youtube-music-with-premium-lite">making Premium Lite available</a> felt like validation; clearly, I wasn't alone in wanting this option, and I was right to cancel my sub until Google let me pay for what I needed <em>and nothing else</em>. The only thing I really miss is having background play — and I can live without it — and downloadable videos.</p><p>As for ad blockers or ad-free browsers, yes, I'm aware that they exist. But I disabled my AdBlock years before <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-three-strikes-policy-for-ad-blockers">YouTube started punishing people for using these methods</a>.</p><p>I didn't think much about it during my college days, but once I had a full-time job, I felt pretty conflicted about using a loophole that stopped the YouTubers I liked from getting paid for their work. Plus, my favorite creators apparently earn much more from my Premium views than from ad revenue, so it feels good to support my favorite channels more directly.</p>
<h2 id="waiting-for-more-premium-lite-sub-options-2">Waiting for more Premium Lite sub options</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="6pvjASLAuGSMQzSoFxqBqG" name="YouTube-Premium-lifestyle.jpg" alt="YouTube Premium homepage on Android" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6pvjASLAuGSMQzSoFxqBqG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now I'm just hoping that Google eventually offers a Premium Lite annual subscription, maybe for $79.99/year instead of $95.88 total with a monthly sub. After that, Google should move on to two-person and family Premium Lite plans.</p><p>Google bundled Premium and YouTube Music to get families hooked on both, but it means families already invested in Spotify Premium Family or Apple One Family won't give Google money because it means double-dipping.</p><p>A Premium Lite family or couple plan would be more tempting as a standalone, and once Google hooks a family, it's much harder to unsubscribe because all your freeloading family members will complain. So it should benefit their bottom line, too.</p><p>Make these new Premium Lite plans happen, Google! In the meantime, I'll keep happily paying for myself.</p>

<p>The May 2025 security update is rolling out for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Google Pixel</a> devices as of today, May 6, and it includes a critical patch for a zero-day security vulnerability. The update also includes three bug fixes and 28 total security patches for issues affecting Android and Google services. The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/342521516/google-pixel-update-may-2025?hl=en&sjid=665115666812218645-NC" target="_blank">says</a> that the May 2025 update's rollout will continue over the next week, depending on your carrier and device model, so you might not see it immediately.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/2025-05-01" target="_blank">Android Security Bulletin</a> outlines the security issues addressed with this month's Pixel update, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-users-just-dodged-a-bullet-as-the-cve-cybersecurity-tracker-stays-funded">the zero-day exploit tracked as CVE-2025-27363</a>. The bulletin notes that "there are indications that CVE-2025-27363 may be under limited, targeted exploitation." Essentially, this means you should update your device as soon as the May 2025 patch is available to avoid falling victim to this security exploit.</p><p>The May 2025 security patch will also update your device's bootloader to add anti-rollback measures. After updating, you won't be able to run older versions of Android 15 on your device. This is likely in response to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-april-security-update-screen-flicker-camera-fixes">both the April and May patches including fixes</a> for zero-day exploits.</p><p>"The May 2025 update for Pixel 6 (6, 6 Pro, 6a) and Pixel 8 (8, 8 Pro, 8a) devices contains a bootloader update that increments the anti-rollback version for the bootloader," Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developers.google.com/android/images" target="_blank">explains</a>. "This prevents the device from rolling back to previous vulnerable versions of the bootloader.

<hr>
<p>Google is rolling out an exclusive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>-backed feature for iOS users on its Google App. The tech giant announced this feature, dubbed "Simplify", in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/search/simplify-google-app-ios/">Keyword</a> earlier today (May 6).</p><p>As the name suggests, this feature breaks down complex concepts into easily understandable text. This is particularly useful when users are trying to learn about something new on the web; they might come across content that uses jargon or technical concepts they're not familiar with.</p><p>Google added that Simplify "uses AI to make dense text on the web easier to understand — without leaving a web page." Thus, people can understand long, winding words seamlessly without losing their research/reading flow.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Kaemmp72eLHxctPw2HGzHQ" name="Google-Simplify - iOS" alt="Google's experiment to test Simplify feature" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Kaemmp72eLHxctPw2HGzHQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>According to the tech giant, the goal here is to simplify text while making sure that the meaning of the original text isn't lost along the way. Google refers to this as "minimally lossy" simplification.</p><p>Before rolling out this feature on a large scale, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://research.google/blog/making-complex-text-understandable-minimally-lossy-text-simplification-with-gemini/">Google Research tested this</a> on a large cohort of nearly 4.500 participants, who were handpicked for topic expertise.</p><p>"We used 31 diverse, real-world text excerpts across domains known for complexity: medical research, biology, law, finance, literature, philosophy, aerospace, and computer science," Google stated.</p><p>These participants were given either the original text, the simplified version, or both. Following this, these users were tested on their ability to retain the text. And were judged based on two conditions: one where they could refer back to the text while answering questions, and one where they could not.</p><p>This resulted in people who read the simplified text understanding the information significantly better and retaining it more compared to reading the original complex text.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oFqaEsnwXb3i9ku6HNdcLo" name="Google-Simplify - iOS" alt="Google Search rolls out "Simplify" on iOS" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oFqaEsnwXb3i9ku6HNdcLo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To use Simplify, select any complex text on a web page you’re visiting in the Google app. Tap the <strong>“Simplify” </strong>icon that appears, and a new window with a simpler version of the text will pop up.</p><p>iOS users with the latest version of the Google App might spot this new feature in action starting today. While it remains unclear when this could roll out to Android users, Android Central has reached out to the tech giant and will update this article when we have more information.</p>

<h2 id="there-s-more-than-enough-great-motorola-razr-2025-cases-available-2">There's more than enough great Motorola Razr 2025 cases available</h2>
<p>The best Motorola Razr 2025 cases come in various shapes, colors, and styles. You can go for a simple clear case or choose something flashy. The Razr 2025 is pretty robust on its own though, and it's one of the few phones I would use naked. Any case adds some level of drop protection, but generally the thicker the case the better the impact absorption, so it's never a bad idea to get one.</p><p>Since you can use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-motorola-razr-2024-cases">Razr 2024 cases</a> on the Razr 2025, you might want to hang on to its covers if you're upgrading devices. When buying new, however, the search might feel a little overwhelming. That's why I've curated this guide of the best cases you should get for your Razr 2025, depending on your needs.</p><p>The best overall pick is the Fin2feel Magnetic Motorola Razr 2024/2025 Case because it's affordably priced, adds 10ft drop protection, promises not to yellow over time, and has a magnetic ring on the back so you can use MagSafe and Qi2 accessories. A clear case like this also lets you admire the color of your Razr 2025 while keeping it fresh. For such a decent case, $14 is a pretty sweet price to pay.</p><p>Another highly functional option is the CCSmall Crossbody Wallet Case. This might be too bulky for some, and that $25 asking price isn't exactly cheap, but the colorways are unique, the crossbody strap is super useful, and the wallet slots are really generous. You could even prop up your Motorola Razr 2025 while watching something thanks to the wallet compartment.</p>

That is, until the Viture x 8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Controller arrived at my doorstep a few weeks ago.</p><p>While it certainly resembles my favorite GameSir controller, it has a special superpower that no other controller to date has: the ability to plug a pair of smart glasses in while getting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/these-smart-glasses-really-saved-my-neck">the neck-saving comfort</a> of smart glasses. More specifically, a pair of Viture Pro smart glasses plugs into the new 8BitDo Ultimate controller, putting the screen on your face so your arms can relax.</p><p>We've named Viture the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">best smart glasses</a> ecosystem because the company has so many different gadgets that work with its glasses, while most other smart glasses are just designed to plug into a smartphone or laptop. This new controller solves a very real problem in the mobile gaming sector, and it does it without eliminating the ability to charge the phone <em>and</em> <em>still</em> play on your glasses.</p>

<p>The Viture x 8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Controller gets all the basics right. It's got dual Hall Effect joysticks, a <em>proper</em> d-pad (read: not one of those circular garbage ones), four face buttons, a screenshot and home button on the front, start and select buttons, two bumpers, two back buttons, and two analog-style triggers.</p><p>The contours are incredibly comfortable, and the controller itself is a smidge smaller than the GameSir G8 Galileo, which makes it feel less cumbersome than that controller. Don't get me wrong, I love the Galileo, but it can feel a little on the chunky side if you have smaller hands.</p><p>The controller connects to your phone via a USB-C port on the right, which is great for most of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best smartphones</a>, but large book-style foldables like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> should remain closed unless you like a big phone hanging down below your controller.</p>

<p>All of the buttons are customizable via the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bbitdo.advanceandroidv2&hl=en">8BitDo Ultimate Software V2 app</a>; just make sure you're using the <strong>V2</strong> app and not the original release. Why these can't be combined is beyond weird to me, as it's terribly confusing, but only V2 seems to allow you to customize the button mapping properly.</p><p>Viture's newly launched <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.viture.gamepal" target="_blank">GamePal app</a> provides a list of recommended games, but is more focused on future feature launches than anything. Viture tells me it's working on a "Full-FoV" feature that lets you launch full-screen games through the app, similar to how the experience feels when connecting Viture smart glasses to a Samsung phone that supports <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-samsung-dex">Samsung DeX</a>.</p><p>Of course, the real draw here isn't just the controller comfort or the customizable buttons — all the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-game-controllers-android">best mobile controllers</a> do those already — instead, it's the ability to connect to your Viture Pro smart glasses while enjoying the ultra-low-latency that only a USB-C gaming controller can deliver.</p>

<p>Since neither the glasses nor the controller has an internal battery, they're both powered by your phone's battery. I've been mostly using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> to test this pair, but I haven't seen any obvious battery drain issues on it or on some other phones I've tested, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review">Honor Magic V3</a>. If the phone does happen to need a top-up, you can plug a USB-C cable or any of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-battery-packs">best power banks</a> into that top USB-C port, and the cord won't even get in the way since it's up top. Brilliant!</p><p>The bulk of my play sessions were spent in Monster Hunter Wilds via GeForce Now on my phone, and my gosh, did it ever look good in 1440p at 120FPS on those Viture Pro smart glasses. It doesn't even require setup or anything like that, either. Just plug the glasses into that dedicated port on the controller, and you're good to go.</p><p>If you'd rather skip the smart glasses and just use it handheld from time to time, there's no need to change any settings or do anything extra.

<p>Motorola has raised the bar for what a premium flip phone should look like with the new Razr Ultra 2025. The $1,299 price tag officially makes it the most expensive Motorola flip phone yet, and has its eyes set squarely on the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7</a>.</p><p>The reason for introducing this third option in the Razr line was to try to capture the premium end of the market, according to Motorola. This calls for a Galaxy Z Flip 7 vs. Razr Ultra 2025 comparison since it's a choice most users in the U.S. are going to have to make once the former is formerly introduced.</p><p>We don't know exactly what the Galaxy Z Flip 7 will be like, but we've got enough leaks for a rough sketch. We might finally get a larger outer display, a slightly bigger battery, some tweaks to the design and hinge, and new software. All of this is speculative right now, but one thing's for sure: Samsung better wow us with its upcoming foldable if it hopes to take down Motorola's dominance and claim the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone" target="_blank">best foldable</a> title.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4SKK4pMU3d5DEjsMzpqELe" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-hands-on-05" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4SKK4pMU3d5DEjsMzpqELe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> is expected to start at the same price as the Z Flip 6: $1,099.99 for 256GB of storage and $1,219.99 for 512GB. Both variants come with 12GB of RAM. This would make the Flip 7 fairly expensive, just like its predecessor. Hopefully, the flurry of expected upgrades should help justify the price. One area where Samsung leads is in the length of software upgrades.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-series-hands-on">Motorola Razr Ultra 2025</a> only comes in a single variant with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage, for $1,299. It's only a little more than Samsung's equivalent storage variant, but you get a lot more RAM. Additionally, buying the phone directly from Motorola will score you 1TB of storage, more than Samsung has ever featured on a flip phone.</p><p>Preorders for the Razr begin on May 7, and the phone goes on sale on May 15. Apart from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-software-update-support">long-term software support</a>, the Razr Ultra 2025 has equally good or better specs than the expected Z Flip 7, making it look like a much better value.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1420px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="v6uuYkHb7LK3DJveFWFgLV" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-7-leaked-render-2" alt="Leaked image of a blue Galaxy Z Flip 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v6uuYkHb7LK3DJveFWFgLV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1420" height="799" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks via Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The big upgrade we're all curious to see is if Samsung actually goes with a larger, edge-to-edge cover display on the Galaxy Z Flip 7. The recent leaks and renders all point towards it, and it should be true in all likelihood.</p><p>We hope Samsung unlocks the ability to natively <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-set-up-and-use-apps-on-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-cover-screen">run standard apps on the cover screen</a> too, and not just widgets, which should be a great utility upgrade. The phone is also expected to have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-might-finally-give-the-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-flip-7-the-screen-upgrades-they-need">slightly larger 6.8-inch folding display</a>, which could make it slightly wider or taller, depending on the new aspect ratio. It will lilely feature a FHD+ resolution and 120Hz refresh rate.</p><p>If the Galaxy Z Flip 7 is anything like the render above, we're looking at a more boxier design compared to even the past generation. We fear that the Flip 7 could be less comfortable to hold than the Flip 6, but we'll have to wait and see.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KuyQUn9CEfDpMLw4EWxpCe" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-hands-on-18" alt="Different colors of the Razr Ultra 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KuyQUn9CEfDpMLw4EWxpCe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Motorola Razr Ultra 2025's design and displays are in another league altogether, which is interesting when you consider how poorly Motorola lagged behind Samsung when both had just introduced their first-gen flip phones. Motorola's obsession with adding different textures to the bottom half of the phone continues as the Razr Ultra gets two unique finishes, including one with wood and another with Alcantara.</p><p>The Ultra's display specs are epic. Both screens on the Razr Ultra 2025 have a 165Hz refresh rate and are bright pOLED panels. The Super HD+ resolution of the internal display is also quite high, finding a medium between FHD+ panels on many flagships and QHD displays on premium models. The outer glass gets Corning Gorilla Glass Ceramic, which should help it survive scratches and cracks well.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TWRFBH69hmoT5yMMNVDz25" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-hands-on-26" alt="Perplexity on the Razr Ultra 2025 cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TWRFBH69hmoT5yMMNVDz25.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We're not expecting a big change when it comes to cameras on the Galaxy Z Flip 7. The cameras on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> were fine and did a decent job, and that'll probably apply to the Z Flip 7 too.</p><p>We should expect a main 50MP sensor with optical stabilization and a 12MP ultrawide camera on the outside. All the leaks so far point to it being a dual-camera setup once again, so it's unlikely that we'll have a third telephoto. The camera in the folding display will probably be the same 10MP sensor again. Real-world image quality should be better, especially if the phone gets the Snapdragon 8 Elite's new ISP and improved software tuning in One UI.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="f2PjhiTXGxJuKTS74nZa8f" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-mint-01.jpg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 cameras and cover panel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f2PjhiTXGxJuKTS74nZa8f.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Meanwhile, the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 now comes with Pantone Validated cameras, which Motorola says should deliver better skin tones and color reproduction. The Razr Ultra also has a 50MP main camera with a similar apeture and specs. There's also a 50MP ultrawide, which in all likelihood, should be able to capture greater level of details than the Z Flip 7. Motorola uses a 50MP sensor for the selfie camera too, which again, should produce much better photos than Samsung.</p><p>Both phones might offer similar performance in daylight shots, but Motorola should have the edge in low-light and ultrawide photos. It can also shoot at 8K, while the Z Flip 7 could be limited to 4K, but we don't know for sure until the phone launches.</p>

<p>On the performance front, the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 could potentially be on equal footing, assuming they both have the Snapdragon 8 Elite. This hasn't been confirmed yet for the Galaxy but we're almost certain it would use that chip, although come rumors have indicated it may <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-might-not-use-a-snapdragon-chip-after-all">use the Exynos 2500</a> instead.</p><p>Benchmark numbers would be up and down for both phones, with some favoring the Razr and vice versa. I don't think you'll notice any difference in real-world usage, though. Games and apps should perform similarly on both. The Razr Ultra could have an advantage for AI tasks and long-term usage thanks to the higher RAM.</p>

<p>Software will also play a big role in how these phones perform, and here, Samsung has Motorola beat when it comes to updates. The Galaxy Z Flip 7 will most likely get seven years of OS and security updates, just like the current flagship S series. That's a big commitment and will ensure your phone is still relevant even if you decide to sell it a few years later.</p><p>Samsung had a few hiccups with the rollout of One UI 7, but it has generally been timely with new software updates. We should also see some new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> features being introduced with the Flip 7.</p><p>The Razr Ultra will only get three OS upgrades, which is not great when you're paying above $1,000. Plus, Motorola doesn't have the best track record for issuing timely updates either, which means it's a bit of a leap of faith here. Motorola is doubling down on AI this year to better compete with Samsung.</p><p>The Razr Ultra 2025 has a dedicated button to activate the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a> hub, which is genuinely useful and does not feel like an afterthought. One of the unique new features is Look and Talk, which lets the phone's owner simply look at the phone in tented mode and start conversing with the AI. We'll be testing all the AI features in our full review, so don't forget to check that when it drops.</p>

<p>The Galaxy Z Flip 7 is expected to have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-z-flip-7-could-get-a-slightly-wider-display-a-new-leak-suggests">slightly larger battery</a> than last time, at 4,300mAh. This should provide a little boost and help the phone last a little longer. Plus, the new chip and software optimizations could help deliver double-digit battery gains compared to the Z Flip 6.</p><p>Charging specs are expected to be the same too, at 25W, although there is a good chance we could see 45W as Samsung has begun using this for its budget A-series phones too. Wireless charging should be present as well at 15W.</p><p>The Razr Ultra 2025 has a much larger 4,700mAh battery, which should deliver vastly better battery life than the Z Flip 7 on paper, although they both could end up being similar. We're yet to test the Razr, but that battery also needs to power two incredibly bright and high-resolution displays, which could negate the advantage of having the higher capacity. We'll know for sure once we have tested both phones, but don't be surprised if both end up having similar battery life in real-world usage.</p>

<p>I know it's easier to recommend the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 for its potential for wider availability and longer software support, but the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 just feels like the better product, as of now anyway.</p><p>The Z Flip 7 is not yet official, so our opinion could change based on what it ends up offering, but the Razr Ultra is a better value pick right now. It's expensive, sure, but you get some of the best specs not found anywhere on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phones</a> in the U.S., along with excellent carrier support. If you're not too bothered with keeping the phone for very long, then the Razr Ultra 2025 looks like a winner through and through.</p>

<h2 id="there-s-only-three-ways-you-can-go-when-choosing-a-motorola-razr-plus-2025-color-2">There's only three ways you can go when choosing a Motorola Razr Plus 2025 color</h2>
<p>To make it simple, you only have three options when Motorola Razr Plus 2025. It comes in pink, brown, and blue. Depth, tone, and texture bring a lot of much-needed context to the three color variants. Of course, getting a good look at all the options is your primary step. That's why this guide focuses on explaining the finish in detail before helping you pick on shade to buy.</p><p>Now that you've seen the shades, you know that all three Razr Plus 2025 finishes are either leather or similar to satin. If you don't or do prefer a certain texture, that's already enough for you to narrow down the colorways. For example, only Hot Pink comes with a satin finish, so you can either prioritize that or cut it out of your shortlist.</p><p>The two vegan leather options also differ slightly, as the Midnight Blue option is an imitation of basic leather. Meanwhile, Mocha Mousse is a lot more complex as it is speckled with little dark spots just like grains of coffee in an actual cup of mocha.</p><p>Based on how much of a grainy texture you like, Mocha Mousse may or may not be the perfect fit for you. It all depends on your preferences and style. Personally, I find that this tan coffee-colored foldable is the most stunning variant of the Motorola Razr Plus 2025. That's a tough call even for someone like me because I adore pink and I love the legacy of that shade on the Razr.</p><p>Even so, Mocha Mousse plays with texture and brings something new to the table. The little details like the dark specks are such an underrated touch. It's definitely the Razr Plus 2025 colorway that stands out the most. So if you're still confused after all this advice, go for it.</p><p>And if you're not even sure about which exact model of the Razr 2025 series you're looking to purchase, we have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/which-motorola-razr-2025-model-should-you-buy">a handy guide for that</a> too.</p>

<ul><li>Android 16 is about to bring a robust Battery Health page to Pixel phones with key performance data.</li><li>The page will show estimated battery capacity as a real-time percentage compared to a new battery.</li><li>Notably, Google is confirming that only the Pixel 8a and newer will receive the useful features.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is adding a Battery Health statistics page to the Settings app for Pixel phones with Android 16, but most models won't be supported. The company says that the feature will be available "on Pixel 8a and Pixel 9 products including 9 Pro Fold" in a reply to an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/403373209?pli=1#comment6" target="_blank">Issue Tracker</a> ticket concerning Battery Health availability. That leaves out all Pixel models released before the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Google Pixel 8a</a>, including the rest of the Pixel 8 series and the original Pixel Fold.</p><p>"The Battery Health Indicator feature is currently supported in Beta 3 on Pixel 8a and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> products including 9 Pro Fold," a Google employee wrote on May 1. "Due to product limitations, this feature will not be available on older in-market Pixel devices."</p><p>Newer Google Pixel devices <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-check-android-phone-battery-health">already showed cycle count data</a> as of last year, but the Battery Health page is set to bring more detailed analytics. Specifically, battery capacity will be shown as a percentage compared to its new state. This should give users an easy-to-understand idea of how their battery will perform on a daily basis, even years after their phone purchase.</p>

<p>"This [battery capacity] is an estimated percentage of charge the battery can currently hold compared to a new standard battery," the Battery Health page in the Android 16 beta explains. "Battery capacity decreases over time."</p><p>Additionally, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/pixel-phones-might-finally-introduce-battery-health-feature-with-android-16">Battery Health page</a> shows a green checkmark and a <strong>Normal</strong> status if the battery is working as expected. It also offers quick links to battery-related support articles, and lists any charging optimization features that are enabled — such as Adaptive Charging.</p><p>While it's unclear what "product limitations" prevent Pixel phones older than the Pixel 8a from supporting the Battery Health page, it may have something to do with the batteries themselves.</p><p>Starting with the Pixel 8a, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/15738128?hl=en" target="_blank">Google says</a> Pixel phones can reach 1,000 charge cycles before needing a battery replacement. Older Pixel phones, namely the Pixel 3 through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a> and Pixel Fold, are only rated for up to 800 charge cycles before a battery replacement is recommended.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a>, and the Battery Health feature for Pixels, will likely be shown off at Google I/O 2025.

But Motorola left no holes barred, giving us four unique textures and color options across the board for every Razr 2025 model.</p><p>With all those options, it's only natural that this decision isn't easy. And that's after you've decided on which model you want to buy.</p><p>I'm here to simplify this process for you. Each one of the Motorola Razr 2025 colorways are epic, so regardless of what you choose don't doubt yourself. However, if you simply can't break the tie between a few shades, I'd say go for the uniquely textured Lightest Sky variant.</p><p>That stunning marble-like back is so opulent and grand, you'll start sticking your pinky out whilst sipping on tea. It's the best take on the beige/cream colorway that Samsung, Google, Apple, and many other name brands have dabbled in before. All of them pale in comparison to Motorola's way of doing things.</p>

<p>Let's go a little more in-depth about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-series-hands-on">Motorola Razr 2025</a> and its last-gen counterpart, the Razr 2024. Both devices have the exact same measurements, and they even weigh the same.</p><p>It's not always true that these factors determine whether you can use the same case on both phones though. After all, Samsung is notorious for changing camera lens positions or button placement just enough that you can't use an older case on a newer phone model. However, Motorola didn't go down that path and we are thankful for it.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-vs-razr-2024">Motorola Razr 2025 and the Motorola Razr 2024</a> are mirror images of each other, except for the color options (and of course the internals are completely different, but that doesn't matter here). Everything from the button placement to the location of the cameras is identical. This is what makes it possible for you to use a Motorola Razr 2024 case on the newer Razr 2025.</p><p>In fact, most smartphone case manufacturers that cater to Motorola didn't even bother to release new cases made specifically for the Motorola Razr 2025. As far as I've seen, a good 80% to 90% of them have just renamed their pre-existing product listings for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-motorola-razr-2024-cases">Razr 2024 cases</a> to include the Razr 2025.</p><p>This isn't a bad thing. In fact, it's quite the opposite. Manufacturers don't need to make a new mould to make new cases for the latest Razr model, so the price stays the same. And since the Razr 2024 is already old now, its cases are cheaper than they were at the Razr 2024 launch.</p><p>This means all Razr 2025 owners have access to a cheaper and much more diverse and wider assortment of cases than they would if they had bought another newly launched phone, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">Pixel 9a</a>. The cherry on top is that it's good for the environment too, since you can reuse your old case should you choose to upgrade. Everybody wins.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you&apos;re a Samsung user looking for a great deal on wireless earbuds; you value great sound and noise cancellation in your audio equipment.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you don&apos;t regularly use Samsung devices; you&apos;re looking to spend $100 or less on earbuds. </p><p>As we described in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">our Galaxy Buds 3 Pro review</a>, these wireless earbuds are pretty much perfect for any user already immersed in the Galaxy ecosystem. Pairing the buds with a newer Galaxy phone like Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">S25 Ultra</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Z Flip 6</a> will let you experience Samsung&apos;s proprietary SSC (Samsung Scalable Codec) technology in action. This means you&apos;re getting better dynamic range, clearer audio, and less noise when you use the Buds 3 Pro. These premium earbuds also deliver 24-bit hi-res support with spatial audio, up to 30 hours of battery life, and active noise cancellation (ANC) straight out of the box. </p><p>Of course, if you aren&apos;t a Galaxy user and you just want a great pair of earbuds, something like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sony-wf-1000xm5-review">Sony WF-1000XM5</a> may be a better, albeit more expensive, choice. Furthermore, Google Pixel users may be better off skipping these Samsung earbuds altogether and buying something like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-review">Pixel Buds Pro 2</a>. Needless to say, there are plenty of excellent wireless earbuds to choose from nowadays, but if you&apos;re already a Samsung user, this might just be the best earbuds deal on the web today.</p>

<ul><li>Another One UI 8 rumor claims Samsung is preparing to upgrade the security strength of its Secure Folder.</li><li>An X tipster alleges Secure Folder will leverage Google's Private Spaces API instead of Android's Work Profiles, which had a vulnerability in One UI 7.</li><li>Other One UI 8 rumors saw the build reportedly working on a Galaxy S25, showcasing weather app changes and phone calls on the Now Bar.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>One UI 8 rumors press on, and a new set claims Samsung is working on upgrading the security/privacy of a key Knox security feature.</p><p>Tipster IposDev has allegedly been sifting through an early Samsung One UI 8 build, claiming the OS <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/DevOfIpos/status/1919344240036872260">will upgrade Secure Folder</a> with Google software (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/one-ui-8-to-make-samsungs-secure-folder-even-more-secure/">SamMobile</a>). Supposedly, the early test build offers insight into the API swap of Secure Folder from Samsung's old work profile preference to Google's Private Spaces.</p><p>In the comments, the tipster responded to a user, stating, "There are some private space APIs on the system side." The tipster went further, adding that they went through the profile IDs, which apparently doubles down on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-enable-secure-folders-your-samsung-galaxy-phone">Secure Folder's</a> swap to Private Spaces.</p><p>The provided snapshots don't highlight any sort of forward-facing change for users. Secure Folder's description reads mostly the same, highlighting its ability to provide "an extra layer of protection" for items you want to keep secure and private on your device, like apps, photos, and more.</p>

<p>This change could be beneficial for users as Secure Folder previously leveraged Android's Work Profiles to separate your data — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsungs-most-secure-feature-seems-to-have-a-few-holes">and that backfired</a>. A vulnerability in One UI 7 was discovered earlier this year, which exposed users' media files in Secure Folder (images, videos) to other apps, which wasn't supposed to happen. This problem was reportedly restricted to people who had <em>physical </em>access to your device.</p><p>Work profiles set up by third-party apps for Secure Folder were also at risk during the initial discovery. Samsung acknowledged the extreme security flaw in February 2025, but didn't offer a potential solution. However, with what's presently rumored for One UI 8, perhaps this is the fix we're looking for.</p><p>In other news, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-android-upcoming-security-privacy-layers">Private Spaces</a> was announced by Google during its 2024 I/O event as a tool to help users safeguard their important, sensitive data. The feature, when enabled, would create a new area on a user's Pixel to store sensitive apps and data. Private Spaces requires users to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-create-private-space-for-your-apps-on-pixel">create a whole new PIN</a> (or fingerprint) for maximum safety.</p><p>It's been a day for One UI 8 rumors, as a recent report stems from a user <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/someone-with-a-galaxy-s25-ended-up-getting-an-alleged-one-ui-8-update">who allegedly got One UI 8 working</a> on a Galaxy S25. The user showed off Samsung's changes to the weather app, like 3D images and animations, as well as the phone call update to the Now Bar.

<hr>
<p>Google's experimental versions of Gemini 2.5 Pro are getting a boost, as there's a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/pro/" target="_blank">Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview</a> (I/O edition) model available for tasks that involve coding and advanced reasoning. The early access comes ahead of Google I/O 2025, an annual developer conference later this month, the company announced in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-2-5-pro-updates/" target="_blank">blog post</a>. The full update will be released at the event, but the preview is already a top performer on key AI benchmarks.</p><p>Users will find "meaningful improvements for front-end and UI development, alongside improvements in fundamental coding tasks such as transforming and editing code, and creating sophisticated agentic workflows," the company explained in a separate post on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/gemini-2-5-pro-io-improved-coding-performance/" target="_blank">Google for Developers blog</a>.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview</a> ranks first on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://web.lmarena.ai/leaderboard" target="_blank">WebDev Arena leaderboard</a> at the time of publishing, a benchmark that specifically tests AI models' performance in web development exercises. It tops <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-7-sonnet" target="_blank">Claude 3.7 Sonnet</a>, which now holds second place. Google holds two of the top three WebDev Arena leaderboard spots, with Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental still holding third place.</p>

<p>You can start using Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview today using the Gemini API in Google AI Studio or Vertex AI for enterprise users. The company says Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview is available at the same price as Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental for paid users, and users can still select the <strong>gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25</strong> version for free.</p><p>Here's everything you need to know about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-io-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">how to watch Google I/O 2025</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-make-the-most-sense-out-of-google-io">how much you should care</a>.</p>

<ul><li>Google's Pixel 9 Pro is poking fun at Apple over a recent string of iPhone 17 rumors.</li><li>The rumors suggest the device could adopt a horizonal camera bar, which looks a lot like the latest Pixel lineup.</li><li>Google's design director stated last summer that the Pixel 9's large camera bump is a product of consumer interests, as people want to take good, high-quality photos.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google's #BestPhonesForever series is back, and this time, the company is teasing Apple over a rumor.</p><p>Google posted a new entry to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/A26C66LX2AA">series on YouTube</a>, saying the show's host, Pixel, is "Responding to the Rumors" with its best buddy, the iPhone. The two devices are discussing the recent string of rumors regarding Apple's potential design for the iPhone 17. As talks begin, the iPhone says, "It's crazy, can you imagine me doing the same thing you did first years later?" The Pixel quips back, "Sounds pretty far-fetched."</p><p>One look at this rumored design can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pixel_phones/comments/1igpd3m/iphone_17_air_features_google_pixel_look/">be seen on Reddit</a>, where users discussed the purported new Pixel-like look. The rumored render shows Apple's iPhone with a horizontal camera bar situation, which gives us serious Pixel 9 series vibes.</p><p>On the other hand, our friends at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/google-pokes-fun-at-apple-for-the-iphone-17s-rumored-pixel-style-redesign">TechRadar</a> highlighted a set of alleged CAD renderings, which continue the horizontal bar narrative. Image runs through a few variations, even a small vertical island, but the Pixel-esque design is still apparent. However, as the publication notes, the rumors suggest the bar will be slightly higher on the device and could expand even more for Apple's iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max if it's to be believed.</p>
<h2 id="google-s-unapologetic-camera-bar-2">Google's Unapologetic Camera Bar</h2>

<p>Regardless, these are nothing but rumors, as the Pixel and iPhone state in their podcast. Google didn't end there with the rumors, as the iPhone walked through other ways Apple "copied" the Pixel. The video highlights Google's Night Sight and Apple's Night Mode "a year later." There's also the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-eraser-non-pixel-phones">Magic Eraser</a> and Clean Up comparison, too.</p><p>Google's Pixel 9 series camera bar is (unapologetically) huge, but the company's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-design-lead-discusses-large-camera-visor">design director says there's a reason why</a>. Last August, Claude Zellweger, Google's Director of Design for Pixel phones, held an interview where they discussed <em>why </em>the camera bump is the way it is. The main takeaway was that the Pixel 9's camera bar was the product of consumer interests. Zellweger stated Google understands that consumers want the ability to take good, high-quality pictures.</p><p>Achieving such a feat, in a handheld device like a phone, requires strong sensors and lenses. Those pieces of hardware aren't small or thin, thus the massive camera bump we have today. Zellweger teased that the major bump might not last forever, and that's recently come true with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a">the Pixel 9a</a> reveal.</p><p>Some of you may remember Google's #BestPhonesForever ad campaign from the company's efforts to draw awareness to the similarities between its Pixel and the iPhone. A previous one we've covered involved the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-campaign-best-phones-forever">Pixel 7 Pro highlighting its ability</a> to unblur photos and capture the night sky, while also providing a VPN to users. Google also showed off the Pixel Fold, poking Apple as it's yet to create a foldable iPhone. There are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnKtcw5mIGUR-aMBz9AphxHzEH7Kt-azY">28 videos in total</a>, all of which feature banter between the two devices.</p>

This means you'll get the basic wireless charging compatibility but won't benefit from the improved magnetic alignment or faster speeds offered by Qi2-enabled devices.</p></article></section>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-series-hands-on">Motorola Razr 2025</a> family offers several upgrades, including improved batteries on some models. While the battery capacity has increased (on the Razr and Ultra models), the phones still use the original Qi standard, which remains the most common and widely supported option for wireless charging.</p><p>One benefit of Qi is that it works seamlessly with a broader range of existing chargers. In contrast, Qi2, although backward compatible, is primarily found in iPhones and a few newer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones" target="_blank">2025 Android flagship devices</a>, offering additional features, such as magnetic alignment, which none of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025">Razr 2025 models</a> support.</p><p>Qi2 charging would have been a plus due to the magnetic alignment, which makes positioning easier and results in faster and more efficient charging. The latest charging technology reduces heat through precise alignment and helps preserve battery health over time, providing a more reliable charging experience.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4064px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="koLWjXKCDwQYaL7Ksi9VWd" name="Motorola-Razr-2025-series" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 with the Razr Plus 2025 and Razr 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/koLWjXKCDwQYaL7Ksi9VWd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4064" height="2286" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For most Android users, the Razr 2025 lineup's lack of Qi2 likely won't be a dealbreaker. The first-gen Qi standard still provides reliable charging speeds and is suitable for everyday use, such as overnight or casual daily top-offs. Nonetheless, without Qi2's magnetic alignment, Razr 2025 model owners must be more cautious when placing the phone on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-wireless-chargers" target="_blank">wireless charging pad</a> to ensure proper positioning.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4136px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="7bNDiJnnfpHtFReerYVuDQ" name="Motorola-Razr-2025-hands-on-1" alt="The Razr 2025 next to the Razr 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7bNDiJnnfpHtFReerYVuDQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4136" height="2327" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>So, why did Motorola decide not to include the Qi2 charging technology in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/which-motorola-razr-2025-model-should-you-buy">Motorola Razr 2025 series</a>? Talking specifically about the Razr Ultra, Motorola said that "incorporating Qi2 charging would have compromised the design due to the size of the magnet." Motorola did not specifically comment on the other Razr 2025 models, but none include Qi2 support, nor do they appear to support the Qi2 standard, similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-support-qi2-wireless-charging">Galaxy S25 series</a>, which is "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-will-come-to-more-android-phones-in-2025-with-help-from-samsung-and-google">Qi2 Ready</a>."</p><p>If you want the fastest wired charging, you'll need a Motorola TurboPower charger of 33W or higher. The Razr 2025 and Razr Plus 2025 support 15W wireless charging, while the Ultra supports 30W wireless charging, which is still plenty fast. Be cautious when using other chargers, as they are not recommended and may harm the charging performance.</p>

<hr>
<p>Motorola shows no signs of slowing down, as a new set of leaks surfaces about another upcoming phone.</p><p>Well-known <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/1919399217031762112">X tipster Evan Blass</a> posted a screenshot of the upcoming Moto G56 midrange phone, and its supposed specs in totality. While the entire alleged spec sheet is there for the taking, there's one striking highlight: Motorola's supposed varied OS update support for <em>each </em>RAM variant. According to the post, the Moto G56 could arrive with a 4GB and 8GB RAM model for its available 128/256GB internal storage pairs.</p><p>However, the spec sheet claims the 4GB RAM version could receive one OS upgrade (one year) and three years of "bi-monthly" security updates. The 8GB variant is said to bring two years of OS upgrades and four years of bi-monthly security updates.</p><p>It's a strange rumor, to say the least. So, we'll have to see what happens for certain once the device launches.</p>
<h2 id="unwrapping-the-leaks-2">Unwrapping the leaks</h2>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">"Bogota" pic.twitter.com/aijaaTzHpj<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1919399217031762112">May 5, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Aside from that, the tipster's post suggests the Moto G56 will debut with a flat, rounded-corner 6.7-inch LCD with a 120Hz refresh rate. Internally, the device is supposedly powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 7060. It's unclear if the back sports some sort of texture (like a faux leather); however, the device's rendering shows a squared dual camera array. Inside is a 50MP primary lens and an 8MP ultrawide camera.</p><p>Giving you a boost during the day is reportedly a 5,200mAh battery, shored up by 33W wired charging strength.</p><p>The rumored Moto G56 is the next-gen follow-up to the G5 from 2024, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/moto_g56_specs_leak_along_with_an_officiallooking_render-news-67655.php">GSMArena</a> states is a bit different. The publication highlights notable changes Motorola is seemingly preparing. The upcoming G56 specifically features a larger display and a slightly bigger battery compared to its predecessor.</p><p>The X leak concludes by stating the G56 could feature Pantone Black Oyster, Gray Mist, Dazzling Blue, and Dill color options. The G55 dropped in August last year, so there's a chance Motorola <em>could </em>try and keep the launch this year close to that.</p>

<p>Motorola's been cruising recently, dropping a couple of phone launches in April. One of the most notable reveals was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-arrives-as-a-trio">the Moto Razr 2025 trio</a>, which introduced consumers to the Razr Ultra. While all three foldables sport Android 15 out of the box, a key highlight is the addition of new Moto AI features and enhanced camera capabilities. The Ultra model even brings back a wood variant that feels like a blast from Motorola's storied past.</p><p>Regarding the recent Moto G56 leak, the company unveiled its new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-edge-60-fusion-announced">Edge 60 Fusion</a> early last month. The design language is quite similar to what we're seeing rumored today: a square camera array, flat display, and rounded corners. The Edge 60 Fusion is a mid-range device with immense durability, thanks to Corning Gorilla Glass 7i and the MIL-STD 810H standard.</p>

<p>It has been raining One UI 8 leaks for the past few weeks. The most recent one comes from a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25</a> user who took to X to post screenshots of the software update screen showcasing the alleged One UI 8.</p><p>The first set of images was posted on May 4, revealing all the details of the update, including the build number: BP2A.250605.015.S938BXXU3BYE2.

<p>There's a high possibility that this user is seeing a pre-release build that Samsung could be testing out on select Galaxy S25 users. Following the initial post, the user took to X to post other UI changes that came with the supposed One UI 8 update. This includes the recent rumors about the major <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/samsungs-one-ui-8-leak-reveals-enhanced-weather-app-with-upgraded-animations">changes</a> to the weather app, showcasing upgraded 3D images and animations</p><p>The tipster also posted screenshots of new watch faces with the UI update that allows users to change fonts and other complications on them.</p><p>They also shared a video of the improved interface with the One UI 8 update, showing apps like the Weather app opening and closing much faster and smoother.</p><p>Beyond that, a blur effect appeared when the user attempted to access media, revealing options for viewing it.

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I love gardening. I've been doing it since I was a kid, and it's something I look forward to every spring. But I've got a full-time job. My wife is a full-time teacher. We've got one kid and are fiercely protective of our family time, despite all the extracurricular activities that come with having an 11-year-old boy. Plus, we've got a house, pets, and a seemingly endless supply of things to fix and people to visit.</p><p>All of that means there's relatively little time for gardening, even though we love it. Thankfully, I've got a little weed-eating robot named Tertill to help me with the arduous task of weeding, and a clever AI-powered app called Seedtime that helps me plan everything I want to do this season.</p>

<p>I've been using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Tertill-Garden-Weeding-Robot-Automatically/dp/B08NXQPZPG">Tertill</a> for years, and this marks the first season since its inception that the product is officially sold out for the foreseeable future. The little $150 robot roams around your garden plot like an old Roomba, covering as much ground as it can in short bursts of time.</p><p>The robot runs off a solar-powered rechargeable battery and has cambered wheels so it's stabilized even when the ground isn't perfectly flat. Sensors keep it from running over tall plants, while another sensor on the underside senses small weeds and uses the built-in weed wacker to remove them from your garden’s existence.</p><p>While Tertill has helped me over the years with one of the most time-consuming tasks in the garden, it wasn't until this season that I found an app to help me with the rest of the work.</p><p>It's early in the gardening season still — we're not even supposed to put things in the ground here until after Mother's Day — but this delightful combo of “robots + AI” has been a massive help in getting things started on time this year.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="p7iqnSbG8PjVPKBEnDuCfe" name="seedtime-app-bigme-color-e-ink-tablet" alt="The seedtime app running on a BigMe B1051C color E Ink tablet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p7iqnSbG8PjVPKBEnDuCfe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I first heard about Seedtime in March of this year, and it immediately caught my eye. It's a garden planner app that helps you understand when the plants you want need to be sown, planted, and ultimately harvested. All the calculations are done for you! All you have to do is follow the task list that's automatically created. I've got it running on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="B1051C ">BigMe B1051C color E Ink tablet</a>, which is perfect for using outdoors.</p><p>Seedtime has a massive database of garden plants, including all the vegetables and herbs you're likely to plant, no matter where you live. The app is free, but I've been using the premium subscription as part of the testing and review process.</p><p>Anyone starting out for the first time this year can stick with the free option, as it provides plenty of functionality and doesn't force you to pay for the basics. If you find you need some of the premium functionality, upgraded accounts start at around $4.55 per month.</p><p>You'll begin your Seedtime journey by giving your garden a name, selecting the region you live in, and then adding in all the crops you plan to plant this year. Seedtime automatically calculates the best time to seed your crops, prepare the beds, transplant plants that need it, and even start looking for things to harvest, all added neatly to the calendar in the app.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The scheduling feature is incredibly smart and will even reschedule tasks based on when you complete them.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>There's even a tasks section that makes it easy to understand what needs to be done <em>right now</em>. Even if you're late to a task — I was several weeks late planting a few crops — Seedtime will automatically catch up your tasks and recalculate when the next action needs to happen based on when you check tasks off your list.</p><p>This part of the app blew me away, as it completely cut out the guesswork often associated with when you need to plant/transplant/harvest, even if the back of the seed package gives you rough estimates. If nothing, it completely solves the daunting task of writing down everything you want to plant and trying to calculate when you need to do things.</p><p>Initially, I felt adding drops was overwhelming because there are so many sections you can fill in, but <strong>can</strong> is the operative word. Everything you need is filled in by default, so long as the app has a premade crop entry.</p><p>Of course, that means that Seedtime doesn't have entries for <em>everything</em> you might want to plant. While it has a million different types of tomatoes, herbs, carrots, and most other staples, you won't find entries for fruit trees or bushes just yet, although those may be added in the future.</p><p>You can manually add these things, and the basic seeding/transplant/harvest/etc sections will still automatically calculate things out for you, but it's a bit more manual work than crops that already have entries.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="N8gjpjKqDpCk2K7pXXRmSe" name="seedtime-app-layout" alt="Creating a garden layout on the Seedtime app on a computer" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N8gjpjKqDpCk2K7pXXRmSe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Once you've got a list of crops selected, you can take those into the layout section of the app and create a full visual garden layout. This part of the experience only works on a web browser for now, although I had no issue opening it up in Chrome on an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablet</a>. If the calendar portion of the app impressed you, the layout section is going to blow you away.</p><p>While Seedtime is working on more automated ways of creating layouts in the future, the process is still manual at this time. You'll drag out squares, rectangles, circles, or a number of other shapes and give them a name.</p><p>After your beds are in the layout, you can drag out each crop and position it where it belongs. It'll even show you the proper spacing, letting you iron out all the nitty-gritty details with very little effort.</p><p>This doesn't just give you a pretty garden layout, though; it also gives you a visual layout of all your calendar entries. A quick glance at the layout portion of the app will let you know what you need to do and <em>where</em> to do it, just in case you forgot where you planted those radishes. The combination of colored calendar entries and visual locations of garden plots is a game changer, and it's going to make the rest of my gardening season a breeze.</p>
<h2 id="ai-you-ll-actually-want-to-use-2">AI you'll actually want to use</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PSYDsfp2tEZtWf7wQsMSde" name="seedtime-app-ai-schedule" alt="Using AI in the Seedtime app to select the next best planting date for crops" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PSYDsfp2tEZtWf7wQsMSde.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The most recent update of Seedtime added an AI-powered companion planting section, giving you five immediate ideas of what to plant near all your favorite crops. This includes staples like marigolds, which can help ward off nematodes, and other companion plants like dill, which can be paired with cucumbers to enhance their flavor. Seeing these companion plants right on each crop’s tile is one of the most genius ways to integrate AI that I've seen yet, and it doesn't stop there.</p><p>Let's say you're adding a specific cultivar of broccoli that the app doesn't have, and you don't know when you need to plant it. On the “add crop” card, you can tap a little sparkly AI button to perform a calculation based on your crop type, cultivar, region you live in, and more. After a few seconds, the app will return a suggested date, plus make any other necessary changes to the crop’s card.</p><p>When Seedtime CEO Paul Dysinger told me about this feature during an interview, I was seriously impressed. A lot of AI-powered features on our devices are cool, but they're not always implemented in useful ways. While AI could always make a mistake and give you the wrong date, Seedtime lets you make a decision before implementing it and gives you other suggestions based on the response, which helps introduce a level of trust in the process.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>AI is built into the Seedtime app, giving you suggestions for what companion plants to plant and when to plant them based on what you want to grow and where you live.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>For now, AI functions are unlimited since this is a brand-new feature, but the company will implement a token system once the process has been finalized. Free users will get a few tokens to use for basic tasks, while paid users will have much wider use with the concept and more tokens included every month.</p><p>The new companion crop planting feature just launched last Tuesday, so a lot of this new AI-driven content is <em>very</em> fresh and shows that the company is adding features that are actually helpful, not just fluff.</p><p>When I asked Dysinger about the potential of adding crop rotation schedules and a few other features like it, he said they weren't out of the question and have been requested in the past. As far as features go, this was the only big one I could think of that would be extremely helpful for many gardeners when planning next year's garden.</p><p>I'm excited to see how Seedtime affects my gardening this year and if I end up being more productive because of it. My biggest problem every year is that I often get overwhelmed with the number of things that need to be done and often miss important dates because of it. Seedtime should fix that entirely, and hopefully it helps you out a lot, too!</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-42">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Samsung’s new Tap to Transfer makes sending money as easy as a phone bump, and it's rolling out to the US later this month.</li><li>Debuted with the Galaxy S25, this feature is Samsung’s answer to Apple’s Tap to Cash, but more open and flexible.</li><li>It's backed by Visa and Mastercard, so you can send money using your debit card inside Samsung Wallet.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Splitting the bill after dinner or concert tickets is always a pain. But Samsung just made things a whole lot easier with the new "Tap to Transfer" feature for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung/what-is-samsung-digital-wallet">Samsung Wallet</a>.</p><p>Samsung first showed off its peer-to-peer payment method when it launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> series earlier this year. It works a lot like Apple’s “Tap to Cash,” where iPhone users can just bump phones to send money.</p><p>But unlike Apple’s walled garden, Samsung’s version plays nice with a bunch of third-party digital wallets too.</p><p>Starting later this month in the U.S., users can send money to friends and family just by tapping their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phones</a> together.</p>
<h2 id="backed-by-visa-and-mastercard-2">Backed by Visa and Mastercard</h2>
<p>Samsung says it has teamed up with Visa and Mastercard to let users send funds using their debit card stored in Samsung Wallet. If the person you’re sending to also has their debit card set up in a digital wallet, the cash moves instantly with just one tap.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:601px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:141.43%;"><img id="QjMgNtKhdj8GkLpwT2Uz6M" name="Samsung-tap-to-transfer" alt="Two phones with Samsung Wallet bumped together" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QjMgNtKhdj8GkLpwT2Uz6M.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="601" height="850" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nonetheless, even if they don’t have a digital wallet, it still works — as long as they’ve got a physical debit card with tap-to-pay powers, Samsung Wallet can link up via the chip.</p><p>If you need to send money from a distance, you can just find your contact by their phone number and send cash their way, no matter where they are.</p><p>Samsung Wallet already lets you store everything from your driver’s license and student ID to that random coffee shop loyalty card you forgot existed. This new update turns it into an all-in-one life organizer and money mover.</p>
<h2 id="money-moves-in-minutes-2">Money moves in minutes</h2>
<p>And in case you’re wondering, the money shows up within minutes (depending on your bank).</p><p>It's worth pointing out that Tap to Transfer isn’t locked into Samsung's ecosystem. It’ll also work with a bunch of third-party digital wallets. That’s because it taps into your existing accounts and debit cards, not just Samsung’s own setup.</p><p>Of course, there might be some limits or fees depending on your bank, and not every card will play nice from day one. But for Galaxy users, this could mean the end of payment app hopping.</p>

<p>Oura <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ouraring.com/blog/introducing-metabolic-health/">announced</a> on Tuesday (May 6) that it is launching two new features to its existing AI-powered lineup designed to help users in the U.S. track their overall metabolic health. Oura has developed a way to track users' blood glucose levels by integrating data from a secondary device directly into the Oura app.</p><p>The ring maker has partnered with Dexcom, an American healthcare company that manufactures glucose biosensors to help users gain insights into their blood-glucose levels during the day.</p><p>This feature can be accessed when users purchase or already own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.stelo.com/">Stelo</a>, a small FDA-approved biosensor worn on the back of the upper arm, which leverages Dexcom’s most accurate glucose technology and reveals how lifestyle factors can affect glucose.</p><p>Members who integrate Stelo with Oura will see their daily glucose readings throughout the day, and also gain insights as to how nutrition, stress, movement, and sleep also have a role to play when it comes to balancing their blood-glucose levels.</p>

<p>Much like other health parameters, this feature will show users contextual graphs on a new "Glucose screen" and insights from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring/oura-rolls-out-its-ai-powered-personal-trainer">Oura Advisor</a> to help them understand glucose levels throughout the day. This way, they can tailor their lifestyle habits to help them maintain or "achieve optimal glucose balance"</p><p>When tracking blood glucose levels, users need to understand a key metric, called “Time Above Range,” which is the time spent above their target glucose range. The Oura app uses AI to analyze this metric and showcases glucose trends for that particular day, based on the user's lifestyle.</p><p>"Meal-induced glucose spikes can vary significantly due to factors like sleep, stress, exercise, and meal timing," said Shyamal Patel, senior vice president of science at Oura.</p><p>And with this feature, the company aims to help users experiment and discover lifestyle habits that impact their glucose levels rather than solely relying on foods that spike it.</p><p>"With this approach, members can maintain a healthy relationship with food while building long-term habits that support metabolic health," Patel added.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the company is launching a seamless method for users to log their meals. Unlike other apps that require manually inputting each food item to track calorie consumption, with the "Meals" feature, Oura's App will analyze an entire plate simply by using a picture. "After several months of testing in Oura Labs, Meals will now be a permanent feature in the Oura App," the company stated.</p><p>Steering away from traditional calorific intake insights,  Meals focuses on macronutrients. As seen below, once users click a picture of their plates, the feature breaks things down for them. Showing each "Meal Item" and the nutrients their plate contains.</p><p>Showcasing elements like protein, fiber, processing level, added sugars, total fats, and total carbs to give users an at-a-glance summary. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring/oura-rolls-out-its-ai-powered-personal-trainer">Oura's AI-powered Advisor</a> also comes into play, which helps users understand their plate better, personalized "non-judgmental" tips about their meals.</p>

<p>ASUSTOR unveiled the Flashstor 6 Gen2 in November 2024, and the NAS is now available globally. The FS6806X model I'm testing has six M.2 slots and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Asustor-FLASHSTOR-FS6806X-Attached-Diskless/dp/B0DKJG5QXS">retails for $999 on Amazon</a>, and ASUSTOR also has a 12-drive model dubbed the Flashstor 12 Pro Gen2 FS6812X <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Asustor-FLASHSTOR-FS6806X-Attached-Diskless/dp/B0DKJJD94W">that costs $1,399</a>.</p><p>In my view, the 6-bay FD6806X should be more than adequate, considering you can add traditional HDD bays if you need to via USB 4. Like the brand's other NAS systems, you get a standard three-year warranty with either model.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-asustor-flashstor-6-gen2-fs6806x-design"><span>ASUSTOR Flashstor 6 Gen2 FS6806X: Design</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="jS4u8dJuBsgBatnvgqfPPY" name="ASUSTOR Flashstor 6 Gen2 FS6806X" alt="ASUSTOR Flashstor 6 Gen2 FS6806X NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jS4u8dJuBsgBatnvgqfPPY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The key benefit of an all-flash NAS is that it is considerably smaller than a traditional home server as it doesn't need to accommodate 3.5-inch drive bays. ASUSTOR went with a horizontal design for the FS6806X, and the NAS reminds me of ASUS routers; the angular design is characteristic of the brand, and it looks cool.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CkYYZtKbWTTWm2HFWTBUPY" name="ASUSTOR Flashstor 6 Gen2 FS6806X" alt="ASUSTOR Flashstor 6 Gen2 FS6806X NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CkYYZtKbWTTWm2HFWTBUPY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, it is bigger than the F8 SSD Plus while not providing as many SSD slots. You get six M.2 slots on the underside, and I can't help but feel that ASUSTOR could have done a better job with the sizing of the NAS. Then there's the location of the buttons; I'll admit that it took me an embarrassingly long time to locate the power button (it's located on the right).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="XD9k5HLoXyXpmWaCzfSuMY" name="ASUSTOR Flashstor 6 Gen2 FS6806X" alt="ASUSTOR Flashstor 6 Gen2 FS6806X NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XD9k5HLoXyXpmWaCzfSuMY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The button glows (obviously), and other than that, you just get the usual status indicators. There's a dual-tone design with a brushed metal effect, but the chassis itself is made out of plastic. The build quality isn't the best; there's a noticeable flex to the chassis, and it doesn't quite have the same sturdiness as other NAS models I tested.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="uvsCmQP9FFybvVDpqPwwSY" name="ASUSTOR Flashstor 6 Gen2 FS6806X" alt="ASUSTOR Flashstor 6 Gen2 FS6806X NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvsCmQP9FFybvVDpqPwwSY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are other issues with the design, particularly with the M.2 drive bay; while most NAS systems use a traditional screw to secure the SSD after it's installed, ASUSTOR went with a plastic backing system that just doesn't measure up. I broke two mounts just by pulling back after installing SSDs, and it is annoying. There's a reason every other SSD NAS in this category uses screws to mount NVMe drives, and I don't know why ASUSTOR decided to innovate in this area.</p><p>Thankfully, the brand nailed the thermal management, and the addition of a fan over the SSD slots ensures the drives don't overheat. I believe the design needs an overhaul, and ASUSTOR needs to do better with the build quality in general.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9jnUjEBtqeTBAahxKdDJZY" name="ASUSTOR Flashstor 6 Gen2 FS6806X" alt="ASUSTOR Flashstor 6 Gen2 FS6806X NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9jnUjEBtqeTBAahxKdDJZY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The FS6806X doesn't have any shortcomings when it comes to connectivity; the NAS has 10 Gigabit Ethernet as standard, and it has dual USB-C connectors based on USB 4 ports alongside two USB-A ports that use the3.2 Gen2x1 standard. You even get a USB-A up front, and it's convenient to back up external drives using the connector.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="bJCPtvN7MTMB6QQ2zkASbY" name="ASUSTOR Flashstor 6 Gen2 FS6806X" alt="ASUSTOR Flashstor 6 Gen2 FS6806X NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bJCPtvN7MTMB6QQ2zkASbY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The NAS is powered by a 2.3GHz quad-core AMD Ryzen V3C14 platform, and it isn't short on power. If anything, it is one of the better choices in this category, and the only issue I have with ASUSTOR going with AMD is that there's no hardware transcoding, so you miss out on that ability. If you're using Plex and need transcodes, you'll need to get an Intel-based model instead, such as the F8 SSD Plus.</p><p>Other than that, you get 8GB of RAM installed out of the box, and as it uses regular SO-DIMM slots, you can switch out memory modules, with the NAS accommodating up to 64GB.</p>

<p>Setting up the FS6806X is easy; just slot in the drives, and you'll be able to configure ADM, the brand's software. ASUSTOR did a much better job in this area in the last two years, and ADM has a decent interface with plenty of great utilities. I was able to set up Plex and Tailscale without any issues, and install the usual slate of services I use on with every NAS.</p><p>I slotted in WD SN770 drives and connected the NAS to my 10GbE network, and it did a fantastic job. It held its own against the F8 SSD Plus in this area, and while there was an issue transferring a 240GB volume of data once, I didn't see any problems after starting over.</p><p>The NAS does a good job as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-nas-plex">Plex server</a>; the native client doesn't have any problems as such, but you don't get hardware transcoding. Outside of that, the FS6806X handles the usual tasks without any issues; backing up photos and videos, accessing data outside the house, and generally using the drive as a media streaming device proved to be hassle-free.</p>

<p>I still think the F8 SSD Plus is the best all-flash NAS around; it doesn't cost as much as the FS6806X, and you get eight SSD slots alongside the same 10GbE connectivity. There's plenty to like with the software as well, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/TERRAMASTER-F8-SSD-Plus-NAS/dp/B0D9HWLDX5">coming in at $799</a>, the NAS is a good value.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a powerful all-flash NAS</li><li>You want 10GbE connectivity</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You want hardware transcoding in Plex</li><li>You need the best value</li></ul>
<p>With SSDs getting affordable, it's not that difficult to set up an all-flash NAS, and the FS6806X has the basics covered. While I'm not a fan of the design, the NAS has good thermal management, and that's what ultimately matters in an SSD enclosure. With 10GbE and USB 4, there are no issues with connectivity either.</p><p>ASUSTOR is making positive strides with its software, and while there are still a few rough edges, it's in a much better position than previous years. Ultimately, there isn't anything wrong with the FS6806X as such, but it isn't quite as good a value as the F8 SSD Plus. The FS6806X gets a recommendation because of the hardware and connectivity, and if you want to maximize value, just know that there are other choices available.</p>

<p>There is <em>a lot</em> to like about the EarFun OpenJump open-ear earbuds! They are one of the least expensive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/best-open-ear-earbuds" target="_blank">open-ear products</a> and compete with more expensive options, like the excellent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/nothing-ear-open-review" target="_blank">Nothing Ear Open</a>.</p><p>Let’s talk hardware and features first. Unboxing the EarFun OpenJump, you’ll find the earbuds case with the earbuds inside. Below the tray the case sits in, you’ll find the usual paperwork and a short charge cable. There are no ear tips because this is, after all, an open-ear affair.</p><p>Though not as large as some, the case will dominate a pocket despite being very light and not feeling particularly reassuring regarding its build quality. That said, it doesn’t creak, and the hinges don’t have any lateral give, making the “plasticky” feel a bit deceptive.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="VPDHPhBp8JQQZGaFSq7RLS" name="earfun-openjump-case-charging.JPG" alt="EarFun OpenJump case, showing the USB-C charging port" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VPDHPhBp8JQQZGaFSq7RLS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At this price point, you do get a well-spec’d clamshell case. It comes with USB-C charging and Qi wireless charging support, which is something even more expensive offerings don’t have. There is a pairing button inside the case, and a status LED on the front face of the case, just below the opening. EarFun says you’ll get a total of 42 hours of additional charging out of it.</p><p>After examining the case, it was time to set up and pair the EarFun OpenJump. When I first opened the app, I was notified that a firmware update was available. Once that was done, my review began in earnest.</p><p>Listening to the EarFun OpenJump in its default setting is enjoyable, but the experience comes alive when you customize the sound to your hearing, with a caveat. We’ll get to that in a moment.</p>

<p>I’ve worn these all day at my day job, and I have to say that they are <em>quite</em> comfortable! They don’t have the adjustability of the AeroFit 2 that I just reviewed, and they aren’t as large as the Nothing Ear Open, but they are tiny, light, and for my ears, a great fit. Depending on the size and shape of your ears, your mileage may vary, though.</p><p>I’ve found them for as cheap as $60, and at that price, they have <em>a lot</em> to offer in the sound quality department. I went back to some of my favorite open-ear TWS earbuds that I’ve reviewed over the last year and performed some A/B testing. They are competitive with open earbuds that cost much more. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/soundcore-aerofit-2-review">Soundcore AeroFit 2</a>, the Nothing Ear Open, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bose-ultra-open-earbuds-review">Bose Ultra Open</a> all fare a bit better when it comes to clarity in the mids and sparkle in the high frequencies.</p><p>Given the cost difference, even with the sub-$100 AeroFit 2, that difference is expected. That said, if cost is your primary concern, the sound signature of the OpenJump is nothing to sneeze at.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="pZF9SgojNbWdAj4zUvC6cT" name="earfun-openjump-app-settings.JPG" alt="EarFun OpenJump EaarFun audio Android app, showing the settings menu" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pZF9SgojNbWdAj4zUvC6cT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I tested the OpenJump with LDAC activated. Doing so deactivates multipoint functionality, but it's worth it to increase the dynamic range. Having tested quite a few open earbuds, in my opinion, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bluetooth-audio-terms-codecs-explained" target="_blank">HiRes Wireless Audio support</a> makes a difference in the listening experience.</p><p>As with all open-ear earbuds, in the silence of a quiet room, the sound signature is much different than when you’re out on the streets or at a beach. In a quiet room, the EarFun OpenJump sound very good. The highs, lows, and mids are all well represented with my custom EQ profile.</p><p>While my custom profile is great in quiet rooms or out on the streets with busy metropolitan life buzzing around me, the <strong>Bass Boost 1</strong> preset gave me an enjoyable representation of all the frequencies despite competing audio from passing cars and other urban jungle sounds. Most importantly, playing at the lower volumes that you’ll want to listen to open-ear products, I still had solid sounds pumping into my ears.</p>

<p>Battery life is excellent with the EarFun OpenJump. Playing a Tidal LoFi stream at about 55% of maximum volume from a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Google Pixel 9</a> with LDAC activated in the app, I saw about 10 hours of battery life. EarFun advertises 11 hours, and those estimates are usually under “ideal conditions,” so having a high-quality codec activated, which drains battery faster, makes that an excellent showing.</p><p>Why didn’t I test them at max volume? That isn’t a realistic use case for open-ears. The whole point is to have your volume mixed with ambient sound at a level where the ambient sound is not only audible but also discernible — enabling you to hear cars or people coming up from behind you, for example.</p>
<h2 id="room-for-improvement-2">Room for improvement</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="3tJAvSvQeLYPbaFuoMDtLS" name="earfun-openjump-more-buds-in-hand.JPG" alt="EarFun OpenJump showing touch control surface" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3tJAvSvQeLYPbaFuoMDtLS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are some things you should know if you’re seriously looking at the OpenJump. At full price, or on sale, there are some tradeoffs. They aren’t deal breakers, just things you should be aware of.</p><p>The Spatial Audio feature, <strong>Theater Mode</strong><em>,</em> is not effective in creating a larger soundstage with quality sound. It also overemphasizes mids and highs to the detriment of the music or video content you're listening to. Music sounds better with it deactivated.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4XodMc8YsatCJx6S2tXokc" name="earfun-openjump-angled-touch-surface" alt="Image of the EarFun OpenJump being worn by Tshaka, showing the touch control surface positioning on his ear" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4XodMc8YsatCJx6S2tXokc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The touch controls could be better implemented. The part of the earbud that sits over your ear and houses the speakers is angled, making it a bit awkward to tap the controls. In the couple of weeks I've had the earbuds, those controls are still problematic for me. Part of that is the diminutive size of the touch surface.</p><p>All is not lost, though. You can customize the controls, adding or removing features to make them work for your situation.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-the-competition-2">What about the competition?</h2>

<p>The EarFun OpenJump competes with Soundcore AeroFit 2 (more expensive) and Baseus Eli Sport 1 (cheaper). Outside the US, Honor and Huawei are also competitors. While I haven’t tested some of those, Harish Jonnalagadda's reviews of the Baseus Eli Sport 1 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/honor-earbuds-open-review" target="_blank">Honor Earbuds Open</a> are positive.</p><p>The most significant difference here is that EarFun has significantly better battery life. Given this, and the OpenJump's good sound quality, it may have the edge over the Eli Sport 1 and Earbuds Open.</p>
<h2 id="the-earfun-openjump-are-a-steal-under-100-2">The EarFun OpenJump are a steal under $100</h2>

<p>At the sale price of $60, these are the budget open-ear earbuds to beat in the States! At their suggested retail price of $80, they’re still a compelling option compared to earbuds priced at $100 or more.</p><p>For their fit, their sound quality, HiRes Wireless Audio support, wireless charging support, and battery life, the EarFun OpenJump are easy to recommend for those looking for open-ear TWS earbuds.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google is gearing up to reveal Material 3 Expressive at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-i-o-2025-prepares-sessions-list-android-xr-ai">I/O 2025</a> later this month, but it accidentally shared its research and design process for the user-interface design shift ahead of time. A blog post published early, captured by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250501004611/https://design.google/library/expressive-material-design-google-research" target="_blank">Wayback Machine</a>, gives us a sneak peek at the future of Android design, and why it's getting more "expressive" (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/05/05/material-3-expressive-leak/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>The conversation started in 2022, when a Google research intern questioned why Material Design apps all started looking the same, and "boring." That led to 46 individual studies with over 18,000 total participants over three years, all trying to figure out how Material Design in Google apps could be improved. In the end, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-ui-icons-panel-redesign-leak">Material 3 Expressive</a> is "both beautiful and highly usable," per the company.</p><p>"Material 3 Expressive principles are rooted in solid research and built on longstanding usability best practices, so designers can confidently use these new components and principles, knowing they're building something that will be easy to use and that people can connect with," the blog post explains.</p>
<h2 id="google-says-expressive-designs-are-cool-2">Google says expressive designs are cool</h2>
<p>Google's blog post reveals that its studies found that Material 3 Expressive design resulted in a higher perception of "brand coolness." The company claims that the coolness factor has a direct correlation to behavioral intent. In other words, Google thinks a "cool" Material 3 Expressive could push users to switch to Android.</p><p>Here's a quick rundown of Google's other findings about Material 3 Expressive:</p>
<ul><li>Google found a <strong>32% increase in subculture perception</strong>, "which indicates that expressive design makes a brand feel more relevant and 'in-the-know.'"</li><li>The company's research also showed a <strong>34% increase in modernity</strong>, "making a brand feel fresh and forward-thinking."</li><li>The studies also pointed to a <strong>30% increase in rebelliousness</strong>, "suggesting that expressive design positions a brand as a bold and innovative leader, willing to break from convention."</li></ul>

<p>The company's research studies for Material 3 Expressive included the following focus areas:</p>
<ul><li>Eye tracking: Analyzing where users focused their attention</li><li>Surveys and focus groups: Gauging emotional responses to different designs</li><li>Experiments: Gathering sentiment and preferences</li><li>Usability: Seeing how quickly participants could understand and use an interface</li></ul>
<p>Google's blog post directly compares Material 3 Expressive to Apple's iOS Human Interface Guidelines. "We have found that well-applied expressive design is strongly preferred by people of all ages over non-expressive design that followed the iOS Human Interface Guidelines, with that preference being particularly strong—up to 87%—among 18-24 year olds," the company writes.</p>
<h2 id="what-s-changing-in-material-3-expressive-2">What's changing in Material 3 Expressive?</h2>
<p>The early Material 3 Expressive blog post shows many examples of how the design language can be used, but it isn't necessarily indicative of the exact changes we'll see in future Android updates. A few design elements we can expect to see appear later on are floating toolbars and accent coloring that make "key actions stand out."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:57.40%;"><img id="dW4DvztadByqyYfNpSzsXB" name="Material-3-Expressive-leak-11.jpeg" alt="The leaked Material 3 Expressive design images." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dW4DvztadByqyYfNpSzsXB.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1148" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google / Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Additionally, the Material 3 Expressive elements were designed with accessibility in mind, as the design guidelines exceed the minimum standards for tap target size and color contrast. The team also made sure to make the design language feel premium while remaining "expressive."</p><p>If you'd like a glimpse of how Material 3 Expressive will directly impact Android's UI and UX, there's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/androids-leaked-battery-status-indicator-bears-a-striking-resemblance-to-ios">a leaked version of the new battery status indicator</a> that serves as a neat preview.</p>
<h2 id="google-s-material-3-expressive-tips-for-app-developers-2">Google's Material 3 Expressive tips for app developers </h2>
<p>The company concludes its blog post by warning developers that expressive design is not "a one-size-fits-all solution." While it works in some situations, it might not be the best choice in others. Google gives the example of how Material 3 Expressive is great for a music app, but not a banking app. In the end, Google says designers need to "respect well-established UI patterns and standards."</p><p>Here is a full list of tips provided by Google to product designers:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Start experimenting:</strong> Dive into the updated <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250501004611mp_/https://goo.gle/4jBGm9S" target="_blank"><u>Material 3 Design Kit for Figma</u></a> and start playing with the expressive design options.</li><li><strong>Try the tactics:</strong> Explore using the seven expressive design tactics [deep link to tactics section of blog post], while also tailoring your UI to support core user journeys.</li><li><strong>Be intentional and start from user need:</strong> While there was broad appeal for vibrant expressive design, a strong minority of users preferred calmer, less intense versions. Always start with what your users need. Work to understand their requirements and critical user journeys before determining the right choice of tactics and components.</li><li><strong>Prioritize functionality:</strong> Don't compromise your product’s core functionality for visual flourishes. No amount of emotion can compensate for a lack of clarity.</li><li><strong>Follow accessibility standards:</strong> Ensure your expressive designs adhere to established guidelines for color contrast, screen reader compatibility, navigation, and other best practices for accessibility.</li><li><strong>Iterate, iterate, iterate:</strong> Use research to identify the right use of our tactics to find the balance between coolness and familiarity or playfulness vs. professionalism.

<hr>
<p>YouTube seems to be finding new ways to increase its premium subscribers. According to a new report, it looks like the streaming platform has piloted a new subscription tier in India, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. This allows users to share their premium subscription with another household member, as opposed to having two subscriptions in the same house.

<p>YouTube told the publication that it is "experimenting with new ways to provide greater flexibility and value to our YouTube Premium subscribers, including offering a two-person Premium plan option, allowing two people to share a subscription at a reduced cost.”</p><p>This move could make it feasible for more people to adopt the premium subscription, specifically between couples, roommates, or family members in the same house, instead of paying for the same subscription twice, which comes up to Rs 298 (149 *2). That would cost almost the same price as YouTube Premium's Family Plan, where six people get to share the subscription for Rs 299.</p>

<p>YouTube Premium has seen a steady price increase over the last two years in many countries across the world. India was also one of the markets that was hit by hike in prices. Rates <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-increases-prices-of-youtube-premium-plans-in-india-here-are-new-prices-vs-old-and-the-plan-that-has-seen-maximum-hike/articleshow/112832224.cms">went up </a>anywhere between 12-60% based on the tire you've subscribed to.</p><p>During the most recent earnings call, Alphabet reported record first-quarter earnings, attributing some of it to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtubes-affordable-ad-free-premium-lite-officially-rolls-out">YouTube's </a>advertising, which brought in $8.93 billion. "Through all this growth, subscriptions are now a big part of the business. We continue to diversify subscription options," CEO Sundar Pichai said during the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/alphabets-q1-earnings-exceeded-expectations-with-a-12-percent-increase-in-overall-revenue">earnings call</a>.</p><p>It remains unclear if this tier will expand to other countries across the globe, considering it would be beneficial and frugal for many with multiple streaming subscriptions. Android Central has reached out to Google about this and will update this article once we have more information.</p>

<p><em><strong>Jaqueline asks:</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>I know a bit about Auracast but I'm not sure how it will work when it arrives in Android 16. I understand I can tune into broadcasts, but can I create one? My husband and I would like to share a podcast on our daily walk, but he wears hearing aids and I do not. Will there be a way to broadcast to his aids while listening on my own Pixel buds at the same time?</strong></em></p>
<p>Hi Jaqueline and thanks for the question, as well as the kind and encouraging words that came with it. Please accept this virtual internet hug of appreciation.</p><p>And this happens to be a great question. It's about something new and potentially really cool, but also very specific concerning the feature itself. When they tell us all the wild things something new can do, companies never talk about any real use cases. So we're gonna :)</p>

<p>First, the good news: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/audio/bluetooth-auracast-broadcast-audio-announcement">Auracast</a> is able to do exactly what you want. You are able to create a password-protected broadcast of audio from your phone that any compatible equipment can connect to, so you can play your podcast and listen through your buds while your husband connects with his hearing aids.</p><p>In fact, Samsung told me its compatible phones can do this right now since they have incorporated Auracast already and pointed me to an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/support/answer/ANS10001042/" target="_blank">article it has already written</a> that details the process. Without the right hardware here, I can't test it for myself. I believe them, though, because this is exactly the type of thing Auracast was advertised as able to do.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ibubzYBf4UEb2UWKjF2u4h" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Buds-2-Pro-Auracast-menu-IFA-2024.jpg" alt="The Bluetooth menu for the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro with Auracast" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ibubzYBf4UEb2UWKjF2u4h.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You knew this part was coming, but that doesn't mean it will work that way everywhere.</p><p>Auracast is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-you-need-know-about-bluetooth-le-audio">Bluetooth LE</a> feature and has a set of complete specifications, meaning it should work universally no matter what hardware you are using. If it's compatible, it should be 100% compatible. That never happens in the real world.</p><p>In fact, Bluetooth is a great example of how "standards" are already seemingly random, and the version number and the equipment manufacturer mean more than anything it says on the box. Ask anyone with two different brands of phone and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-android-automotive-15-features-detailed">Bluetooth infotainment system</a> from a car maker all about it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="pfCwgAvrXh4Wf8PcVddieN" name="ReSound-Nexia-Hearing-Aids.jpg" alt="Auracast-enabled hearings aids" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pfCwgAvrXh4Wf8PcVddieN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I would not be surprised if things didn't work the way we expected or were told they would, especially at first. Normally, that's not a big deal as long as we get some sort of functionality, but in this case, you might be buying new hearing aids and making sure your phone is advertised as capable, so it could get a little pricey.</p><p>No amount of money is too much to spend if it makes you and your husband happy or have a better life, but if it was supposed to and doesn't, that's a bitter pill to swallow.</p><p>I hate suggesting this, but I am going to anyway — wait. Let the feature arrive on more devices and somebody will test it to make sure it works the way we expected it to work. Look at your favorite tech websites and audio/Hi-fi websites until someone tries it. If it works, you'll even know what hardware it works with.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Uqxr59qzLbWWsE3PsiDZDP" name="Auracast-experience-airport-smartphone-IFA-2024.jpg" alt="A phone connected to another phone's Auracast broadcast" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Uqxr59qzLbWWsE3PsiDZDP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I'm very interested in the accessibility aspect of Auracast myself, so I'm in the same boat. Listening in a crowded bar or to a sports announcer seems pretty cool, but to me, the best part of the tech is its (hopefully) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://hearingassociatesmc.com/blog/what-is-auracast">better functionality with hearing aids</a>. If I can source the things I need, I'll be sure to give it a load of testing myself and would definitely share any and all experiences.</p><p>In the meantime, I'm holding on to a few dollars until I know it will work the way I want it to work with the things I spend my own money on. If you do check it out, please drop me a line and let me know how it went!</p>

Ahead of that expected launch, numerous leaks and APK teardowns are r<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-ui-icons-panel-redesign-leak">evealing key elements of Material 3 Expressive</a>. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://t.me/mysticleaks/104" target="_blank">Mystic Leaks on Telegram</a> recently shared a preview of the redesigned Clock app, and it is now giving us a look at Android's new battery status indicator (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/android-new-battery-icon-up-close-look/" target="_blank">Android Police</a>).</p><p>For the most part, Android's new battery status indicator is a horizontal battery icon with black numerical text showing the current percentage. However, it'll change based on the charge state. The colors pop more than the existing battery indicator, filling up the portion of the battery icon that's remaining in charge.</p><p>You'll see a green icon when your phone is charging, a yellow icon when battery saver is active, and a red icon when your phone has low power. A lightning bolt will appear beside the status indicator when an Android device is charging, and a plus sign indicates battery saver is turned on.</p><p>You can see the various iterations of the new Android battery status indicator in the screenshots below, as revealed by Mystic Leaks:</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1660px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:30.36%;"><img id="EBLCDyYNikikBPxBNeiMNi" name="Android-16-Battery-Icon-Leaked" alt="The variations of the new Android battery icon." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EBLCDyYNikikBPxBNeiMNi.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1660" height="504" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Mystic Leaks / Telegram)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If it wasn't obvious already, Android's upcoming battery status indicator seems to take more than a few cues from iOS. The horizontal, color-coded battery icons with bolded percentage information have been a staple of Apple's mobile operating system for some time now. Based on the screenshots above, Google's variant appears to feature larger, bolder text.</p><p>It features black percentage text within the icon, whereas Apple's icon shifts between white and black text based on the current background. If you're using a dark background on iOS, you'll see a white battery icon and black text, and vice versa. It's currently unclear whether Android's new battery status indicator will work the same way.</p><p>We don't know when Google's planned Material 3 Expressive design changes will roll out. The company has a session regarding the changes set for Google I/O 2025, so it's expected we'll learn more there, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-teases-a-special-i-o-edition-of-the-android-show">at The Android Show beforehand</a>.</p><p>Here's everything you need to know about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-io-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">how to watch Google I/O 2025</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-make-the-most-sense-out-of-google-io">how much you should care</a>.</p>

<p>Roku users looking to enjoy Andor Season 2 aren't having a great time, as reports fly off the shelves.</p><p>Over the past few days, Roku owners have taken to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.roku.com/t5/Issue-Tracking-Board/Under-investigation-Disney-Plus-Washed-out-colors-on-content-after-recent-update/td-p/1071118/highlight/true">official forums</a> to report issues when streaming Disney Plus using the company's products (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/660950/roku-hdr-issues-washed-out-colors-gray">The Verge</a>). A main thread for reports was created by a Roku moderator to gather information. Users quickly chimed in, stating that, while watching Disney Plus, the colors in the content appear "washed out." One <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.roku.com/t5/Issue-Tracking-Board/Under-investigation-Disney-Plus-Washed-out-colors-on-content-after-recent-update/td-p/1071118/highlight/true#:~:text=a%20week%20ago-,Disney%2B%20Colors%20Washed%20out%20after%20recent%20update,-Hello%2C">user states</a> they own a TCL model 65S405 and their colors are "bright/washed out."</p><p>The user <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.roku.com/t5/Issue-Tracking-Board/Under-investigation-Disney-Plus-Washed-out-colors-on-content-after-recent-update/td-p/1071118/highlight/true#:~:text=a%20week%20ago-,Re%3A%20Disney%2B%20Colors%20Washed%20out%20after%20recent%20update,-My%20issue%20sounds">goes in-depth</a>, stating they're encountering these issues while watching content in 4K/HDR resolution. The post states that tinkering with HDR's settings only provides a minimal (positive) difference, but the Disney Plus content still appears washed out or extremely bright. Moreover, these issues seem to extend to YouTube videos, but aren't "nearly as bad."</p><p>Another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.roku.com/t5/Issue-Tracking-Board/Under-investigation-Disney-Plus-Washed-out-colors-on-content-after-recent-update/td-p/1071118/highlight/true/page/2#:~:text=Tuesday-,Re%3A%20Disney%2B%20Colors%20Washed%20out%20after%20recent%20update,-Having%20same%20exact">report claims</a> to have encountered issues with Roku's streaming device on Amazon Prime, as well as Disney Plus. This user states problems disappear when streaming at HD quality.</p><p>One thing in common that all of these reports share is <em>when </em>the problems occurred: right after Roku's v14.5 software update. The problems appear quite closely connected, considering the sheer number of reports citing the same version and issue across several video streaming apps. The Roku moderator said the company is investigating, so hopefully, a resolution will arrive sooner rather than later.</p>

<p>The Verge dug deeper, and discovered that while the bulk of user reports concerned TCL TVs, there were a few that involved Hisense devices.</p><p>Strangely, these reports report severe issues with the streaming quality/experience of Roku's devices <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.roku.com/article/228844467">following v14.5</a>. The update, which rolled out in April, didn't focus on streaming "quality," per its patch notes. Roku cited bug fixes, security improvements, and the like. However, it did note the addition of "performance optimizations." There's a chance there's some conflict going on between the previously mentioned TVs and the latest OS.</p><p>Roku was also on our minds recently, as users started noticing its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/roku/rokus-autoplay-ads-on-startup-are-rubbing-users-the-wrong-way">autoplay ads on startup</a>. The experiment involves displaying ads to users before they're able to reach the stick's true home screen. Regardless, users haven't reacted too kindly to seeing these ads while trying to relax with their shows or movies. Users reported the ads are "unskippable," but Roku claims there is a way to close them.</p><p>Another report tested this theory and concluded that the option to jump past these ads wasn't available. Users on Reddit added they were stuck watching movie trailers, unable to get to the content they truly desire.</p>

<ul><li>Google's code seemingly points toward a new security feature called "Intrusion Detection," which could debut in Android 16.</li><li>The feature, if granted permission, would let your device log encrypted entries about key device information to help you identify suspicious activity.</li><li>Android 16 Beta 4 arrived for testers in mid-April, as Google prepares for its expected May launch of the software.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A report claims Google is working on a new security feature for Android 16 that keeps your finger on the pulse of suspicious activity.</p><p>Surprisingly, the discovery was made in a recent Google Play Services app beta by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-16-intrusion-detection-3550583/">Android Authority</a>, and not in Android 16's Beta. This feature, known in the code as "Intrusion Detection," could be part of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-is-expanding-passkeys-to-its-advanced-protection-program-as-us-election-nears">Advanced Protection</a>. Alongside tipster AssembleDebug, the publication discovered the feature will contain its own "Log Collection" and store key details about several aspects of your device.</p><p>Specifically, Intrusion Detection will log information about your browsing history, app installs, saved Bluetooth connections, lock screen credentials, and Wi-Fi.</p><p>A user's Google account comes into play here as the early surfaced code suggests all of these important details will be stored there. What's more, findings suggest the logs will be placed within a "private and encrypted" Google Drive, which only you (the owner) can get into.</p><p>Google's code adds the information it stores "can be used for forensic analysis in case of suspicious activity."</p>

<p>On the surface, this feature seems like a useful addition for users looking to keep an extra close eye on their data. The tipster discovered that, as you'd expect, users have to enable this feature by granting permission to store their data. On the other hand, Intrusion Detection <em>feels </em>like an extension of Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-is-expanding-passkeys-to-its-advanced-protection-program-as-us-election-nears">Advanced Protection Program</a>. The purpose of the program is to bring extra, fortified security for users to protect their account information.</p><p>Advanced Protection can not only help users avoid malicious downloads, but the company introduced passkey support for sign-ins to the program. This is a part of Google's efforts to move users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chrome-m108-passkey-support">away from passwords to passkeys</a>, which require biometric credentials.</p><p>The program was also designed to help users who are more "at risk" for cybersecurity attacks, like campaign workers, journalists, human rights activists, and more.</p><p>The publication states this isn't the first time its observed Intrusion Detection in Google's code, but it has seemingly progressed since then. Still, there's no telling if we'll see this during Android 16's arrival or after. Speaking of, the company dropped <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-drops-android-16-beta-4-before-the-big-stable-launch-in-may">Android 16 Beta 4</a> for testers in mid-April. The update cleaned up some loose ends as Google prepares for its Q2 2025 launch, which might happen this month.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung might surprise us with a faster-than-expected One UI 8 beta launch, possibly as soon as June.</li><li>One UI 8 isn’t expected to bring big new features like One UI 7 but will likely focus on improving and refining what’s already there.</li><li>Leaks point to a July or August 2025 release window, which lines up with Samsung's foldable launch plans.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Even though Samsung has been pretty quiet about what's next for One UI, some early information hints that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-will-bring-one-ui-8-sooner">things might be moving faster than usual behind the scenes</a>. Word on the street is we could see the beta version of One UI 8 drop as early as June this year, which would be a solid head start compared to the previous rollout.</p><p>This scoop comes from Tarun Vats on X. According to the leaker, Samsung might be shaking things up this year, with a testing schedule for One UI 8 that veers off from how the company handled things with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review">One UI 7</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/samsung-one-ui-8-june-launch/" target="_blank">Android Police</a>).</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey Galaxy Fam!!Hearing from sources that Samsung might launch the One UI 8 Beta as early as June!But as always — take it with a grain of salt. Samsung’s update timelines can shift anytime! pic.twitter.com/s0URGAJMwv<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1918632520632901992">May 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Samsung has built a solid reputation for being on point with software updates, rarely missing a beat. But the One UI 7 rollout threw folks off a bit, as it came in slower than expected. Still, looking at its history, it feels more like a random blip than a sign of a bigger shift in how Samsung does things.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="UBfByb7JCLTyZoeu3ywnWT" name="Android-16-logo-purple-Honor-200" alt="A purple and green Android 16 logo on an Honor 200 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UBfByb7JCLTyZoeu3ywnWT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now that Android 15 is officially landing on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Galaxy devices</a>, all eyes are naturally turning to One UI 8. Samsung potentially kicking off as early as next month would be a pretty quick turnaround.</p><p>Still, Vats urges folks not to get too locked into that date just yet. Samsung’s timelines tend to shift depending on how things shape up during development, so it’s all still a bit up in the air.</p><p>If the June beta launch actually happens, Vats thinks there’s a good chance the stable One UI 8 (powered by Android 16) could land as early as August or September. That’d be a way tighter rollout than what we saw with One UI 7.</p>
<h2 id="no-major-overhauls-this-time-2">No major overhauls this time</h2>
<p>It’s also worth pointing out that One UI 7 was a pretty major leap for Samsung, packed with big changes. One UI 8, on the other hand, is expected to be focused on polishing things up rather than introducing a bunch of flashy new features.</p><p>Leaked details from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s25-caught-testing-samsungs-upcoming-one-ui-8-android-16-update">internal tests</a> on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> point to a release window around July or August 2025. This timing lines up with the expected launch of Samsung's next-gen foldables.</p>

<p>As described in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">our 4/5-star review</a>, the Google Pixel 9 is a powerful flagship phone with a ton of AI-boosted software features, 12GB of RAM, and seven years of OS/security upgrades straight out of the box. The phone also features the excellent camera tech that Google is known for, plus you&apos;ll enjoy a vibrant 6.3-inch AMOLED display, awesome haptics, and smooth performance from the phone&apos;s Tensor G4 chipset. </p><p>If you&apos;re trying to decide between the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-vs-pixel-9">Pixel 9a and the Pixel 9</a>, it&apos;s worth mentioning that the cheaper phone has a slightly larger battery and a lighter build than its counterpart. Other than that, the Google Pixel 9 is a considerably better phone by just about every metric.

<ul><li>Google's AI Mode is rumored to receive a new "Live for AI Mode" feature following newly spotted code.</li><li>The feature seems to leverage Google Lens quite heavily, and could provide a more vocal or conversational experience with AI Mode like Gemini Live.</li><li>A few days ago, Google's AI Mode opened to all Labs testers in the U.S. and adds visual cards for products and places.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google isn't slowing down the development of its latest AI feature, as a newly spotted mode could help take things further.</p><p>AI Mode for Search is Google's latest focus, and a post by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/05/05/google-ai-mode-live-lens-teardown/">9to5Google</a> suggests there's a little more on the way for mobile. The publication's Google app teardown reportedly contains code about a "Live for AI Mode" feature in the works. Supposedly, early code leads speculation to believe it'll function similarly to Gemini Live. Aside from the "Live" tag in the code, there is a button to "End Session" and mute your microphone.</p><p>A description within the code states this "Live" feature lets users "have a real-time voice conversation with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-tests-experimental-ai-mode">AI Mode</a> to find exactly what you’re looking for."</p><p>Other than these similarities, the post states "Live for AI Mode" will primarily piggyback off the mode's Google Lens integration. Many of the code strings begin with "lens_live," furthering this report. So, it seems users can bring an item or place within Google Lens' view and "start speaking to search." Additionally, users may be able to interrupt the AI to offer more information or to guide it in a new direction.</p><p>However, this feature seems to have a small limitation: an inability to ask follow-up questions. If the AI understands a would-be question as a follow-up, it'll be treated as a brand new question for a whole new search.</p>

<p>As the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/04/07/google-ai-mode-lens/">publication notes</a>, Google rolled out its Lens integration for AI Mode in early April. The feature worked like Lens in other places, where users can take a snapshot and then speak their query for a search. However, what we're seeing rumored now is a little more flexible and intuitive, as users can have a more conversational experience with the mode. What's more, during that same time, Google Lens received <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-lens-new-search-feature-lets-you-find-objects-using-a-mix-of-text-and-images">an update for "multisearch."</a></p><p>In short, the update brought the ability for users to combine images with text when searching for items through Lens. As an example, Google says users could take a snapshot of a dress they like and add a new color in the text field. Lens would take everything into account and try to locate a similarly styled dress (or the same one), but in your preferred color.</p><p>There's no telling when "Live for AI Mode" could arrive for users; however, AI Mode <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/geminis-ai-mode-opens-up-to-more-people-with-new-features">picked up a new update</a> on May 1. After opening to everyone using Labs in the U.S., AI Mode will now display a history of your previous queries, like Gemini. Google also detailed users would soon receive the ability to tap for more details when using AI Mode. Such details would be contained within blocks for "local spots," like restaurants and stores.</p><p>Reviews, ratings, store hours, and the like will be available for interested parties.</p>

<ul><li>Early leaked renders of the Moto Edge 70 showcase a design reminiscent of the recently launched Moto Edge 60.</li><li>The device is likely to feature a triple-camera setup and be powered by a Dimensity 7000 series chipset with 12GB of RAM as standard.</li><li>A potential launch date in late September is hinted at through an easter egg in the leaked render's wallpaper, following a pattern from previous Motorola releases.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Motorola very recently unveiled the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-edge-60-fusion-announced">Edge 60 series</a>, and a couple of weeks later, we now get to see what the successor would look like, thanks to a new leak.</p><p>The leak comes from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/motorola-moto-edge-70.html">Android Headlines</a>, which has showcased possible renders of the Moto Edge 70. It is quite early to see a successor render within weeks of the predecessor’s launch; however, they reveal the device in full, and it looks a lot like the recently released Moto Edge 60.</p><p>The Edge 70 is likely to carry the curved edges, and the device will also be boasting vegan leather back and a familiar camera visor with three cameras. And, like the Edge 60, the successor is also expected to have a 50MP primary camera, next to a 10MP telephoto lens and 50MP ultra-wide angle lens, the publication notes.</p>

<p>Underneath, the device is rumored to have a Dimensity 7000 series chip, likely the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-7400-7400x-ultra-efficient-gaming-ai-chips">Dimensity 7400</a> SoC. The RAM upgrade is also expected, and 12GB should be common across all storage variants.</p><p>As for the launch, the publication indicates that it could be somewhere around September 24 or in the same month. The date here is obtained through the Easter egg found in the phone render’s wallpaper, which is September 23. The logic considered here is also interesting because the Edge 60 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-arrives-as-a-trio">Razr 60 series</a> official renders showcased the April 23 date, while the devices were actually launched on April 24.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Moto Edge 60 series from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://motorolanews.com/the-new-motorola-edge-60-series-is-here-sporting-the-worlds-most-immersive-quad-curved-display-a-pro-grade-quad-camera-system-and-advanced-moto-ai-features/">early last month</a> included two new devices, the Moto Edge 60 Pro and Edge 60, joining the Edge 60 Fusion, which was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-edge-60-fusion-announced">announced</a> early last month. The Edge 60 and 60 Pro came as quad-curved devices in the segment they fall in and also equipped with the popular IP68/69 rating for ultimate protection against water and dust. Both devices are further incorporated with a host of advanced Moto AI features.</p>

<hr>
<p>Let's just say it's pouring <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide">Samsung Galaxy foldable leaks</a>. Samsung is due to launch this year's foldables sometime in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-unpacked-could-take-place-in-new-york">July</a>, and it seems inevitable that more information about these devices will keep popping up. With this fresh set of leaks, we got insight into the display and battery capacity of the devices.</p><p>First, avid Max Jambor took to X to reveal that the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide"> Galaxy Z Flip 7 </a>will have a wider display than the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-hands-on" target="_blank"> Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> (as first spotted by<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sammyguru.com/tipster-confirms-wider-display-slimmer-bezels-for-galaxy-z-flip-7/" target="_blank"> Sammy Guru</a>). Jambor posted a cryptic X post that states, "B7 Display: 161.57 x 69.96 mm."</p><p>According to the publication, B7 is an internal codename given to the Galaxy Z Flip 7, meaning the phone will have the above-mentioned dimensions. The Galaxy Z Flip 6's dimensions are 165.1 x 71.9 x 6.9mm, and the leak suggests that the next Flip will have a 166.6 x 75.2 x 6.9mm display.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">B7 Display: 161.57 x 69.96 mm<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1919350260058481088">May 5, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>They also seemed to have calculated the device's aspect ratio, which could be 22:9.53. This is a slightly wider aspect ratio compared to the rumored 22:9 of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review" target="_blank">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>. If the above information is close to the truth, then the upcoming Galaxy Z Flip 7 might be wider and slightly taller, featuring thinner bezels than its predecessor.</p><p>In a separate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thetechoutlook.com/tech-whispers/samsungs-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-galaxy-z-flip-7-batteries-spotted-on-the-ul-demko-certification-platform/">leak</a>, the upcoming foldables were spotted in a  UL Demko certification platform. Samsung's upcoming clamshell was mentioned in the certification, with the model numbers: ‘EB-BF766ABE’ and ‘EB-BF767ABE.’</p><p>The publication notes that the charging capacities of the Galaxy Z Flip 7 totaled 4,174 mAh, which could show up with a typical capacity of 4,300 mAh, based on previous rumors. This means that the latest Galaxy Z Flip 7 could carry a larger battery than the Galaxy Z Flip 6 (4,000 mAh).</p><p>The certification also listed the alleged Galaxy Z Fold 7 batteries with model numbers ‘EB-BF966ABE’ and ‘EB-BF967ABE,’ stating that they have received the UL Demko certification.</p>

<p>According to The Tech Outlook, the certification lists that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> will show up with two Li-ion batteries totaling 4,272 mAh in rated capacity.

<p>A couple of weeks ago, Instagram <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/instagram-private-blend-reels-spotted">announced a new feature</a> to keep its users more engaged, especially in the Direct Messages (DMs). The head of the social media platform, Adam Mosseri, had introduced the feature, dubbed Blend, and it appears the feature is seeing a wider rollout across regions.</p><p>Blend is a new way for Instagram users to connect with friends in DMs. It is a shared feed of popular Reels that combines recommendations from individual users and their friends—both can see a shared feed of Reels according to their tastes. Generating a shared feed is quite easy, and it can be created with a friend or in a group DM.</p>

<p>Heading over to the DM and clicking the new Blend icon would start the invite process. These suggested feeds of Reels will be based on each person’s activity on Instagram, which can include the Reels they individually watch and interact with. And when a couple of friends join a Blend, the Reels shared in the chat will be informed, and the Blend gets updated for everyone in the chat if it is a group chat or DM.</p><p>Each user in the chat has an option to either stay in the blend and also have an option to opt out at any time per their preference.</p>

<p>As noted, the feature was first announced a couple of weeks ago, and while some users started experiencing the feature the same week, other users have started witnessing the new Blend icon last week, including in regions like the U.S. and Canada. It appears to be a phased rollout, and if you are not seeing the option yet, you could soon be having it in the coming days or weeks.</p><p>Meanwhile, Instagram has also introduced not a feature but an entirely new app, dubbed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/instagram-finally-launches-edits-app-for-both-android-and-ios-users">Edits for Android and iOS platforms</a>, late last month. It is the company’s take on Byte Dance’s CapCut as it features advanced editing tools like clip-level precision, green screen feature, and AI image animation. It further allows content creators to see their real-time stats, including viewer engagement on Reels. It was initially announced in January, but the global rollout began last month.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung is gearing up to unveil the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26</a> lineup in early 2026, and it looks like the company's split-chip play is making a comeback. Rumor has it Europe is locked in for the Exynos 2600, while the rest of the world gets the next-gen Snapdragon.</p><p>A new leak on X from user @Jukanlosreve claims Samsung is going back to its old chipset-splitting ways for the Galaxy S26 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s26-with-exynos-2600-might-only-be-sold-in-europe-snapdragon-everywhere-else/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>). And even though the launch is still a ways off, the rumor mill is already heating up.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Latest industry note related to Samsung:Exynos 2600 is indeed planned to be used in the S26.Currently, due to reportedly low yield, it is likely to be equipped mainly in European models.An industry source emphasized that even in the AP for the S26, Qualcomm’s Snapdragon…<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1918512446777770308">May 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>What’s wild is that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/early-rumors-galaxy-s26-exynos-change">buzz about the S26 using Exynos in certain regions started popping up</a> even before the S25 was officially announced.</p><p>The latest rumor seems to back up earlier leaks, at least partly. Samsung is reportedly making strides with its 2nm Exynos 2600, but production still isn’t smooth enough for a worldwide release. So for now, it looks like regions like Europe will be the ones getting the Exynos-powered Galaxy S26.</p><p>Meanwhile, the U.S. and a few other regions are expected to get the Galaxy S26 with Snapdragon power under the hood.</p>

<p>We heard this same song and dance last year, with talk of Samsung possibly using the Exynos 2500 in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> lineup. But when the phones dropped in January, that didn’t happen, and Samsung went all-in on Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite instead.</p>
<h2 id="history-repeats-itself-2">History repeats itself</h2>
<p>Samsung is no stranger to using its own Exynos chips in European <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Galaxy flagships</a>. But over the years, these in-house chips have taken heat for lagging behind Snapdragon in performance, battery efficiency, and heat control.</p><p>Galaxy fans in Europe have been sounding off for years about Exynos chips falling short, especially when it comes to graphics power and battery efficiency compared to Snapdragon.</p><p>Still, Samsung seems set on sticking with its in-house silicon. The upcoming Exynos 2600 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-exynos-2600-chip-urgent-push-reported">rumored to be 15–25% more energy efficient</a>, but it's got a ways to go, with its production yield sitting around 40%, while TSMC is hitting 60%.</p><p>The latest scoop shows Samsung is all in on its Exynos chips, but we’re still not sure how the regional split will play out. It’s still up in the air whether every Galaxy S26 model will follow this pattern, or if the top-tier S26 Ultra will get Snapdragon everywhere, like the S24 Ultra did with its Snapdragon processor worldwide.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>There are few consumer tech products that are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-is-the-most-exciting-phone-around">as interesting as the Mate XT</a>; Huawei somehow managed to create a tri-folding design that actually holds up to daily use, and the device gives us a great preview of where foldables are headed. There are so many things to like in the Mate XT; it is the thinnest foldable you can buy today, with Huawei outmatching the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">Find N5</a> in this regard.</p><p>The phone has unmatched flexibility; you can use it as a regular slab phone, a fold-out device, or a full-fledged 10.2-inch tablet, and I switched between all three modes extensively in the two months I had the foldable. The internals aren't quite on par with the best that Qualcomm has to offer, but I didn't run into any slowdowns as such, and the battery life is fantastic considering the sheer size of the device.</p><p>But the most impressive feature has to be the cameras; most foldables have a camera system that doesn't measure up to traditional flagships, and this is one of the main reasons why I still haven't switched to one as my daily driver. I enjoyed using the Find N5, but it doesn't deliver the same caliber of photos as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/oppo-find-x8-ultra-review">Find X8 Ultra</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a>.</p>
<p>This is where the Mate XT has a distinct advantage; Huawei put its best imaging modules into the device, and the foldable easily pulls ahead of every other device in this category. I tested it against the Find N5, and there's no question that Huawei did a stellar job with both photos and videos. What's interesting is that the Mate XT manages to hold its own against the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-ultra-review">Xiaomi 15 Ultra</a>, and that is an achievement in and of itself.</p>

<p>The Mate XT produced photos with accurate color rendition; it was an overcast day, and the foldable did a good job highlighting that. The Find N5 has cooler colors, and it had issues with shadows, often failing to deliver the same level of detail around the edges.</p>
<iframe allow="" height="480" width="100%" data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=e4c52042-295a-11f0-bb23-0936e1cb08fb"></iframe>
<p>Both foldables did a decent job in this image, but once again, the Find N5 has increased contrast and saturation, and it doesn't quite have the same accuracy. It also loses out on detail when you zoom in to the image.</p>
<iframe allow="" height="480" width="100%" data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=10a30670-295b-11f0-bb23-0936e1cb08fb"></iframe>

<p>You get great versatility with the Mate XT as well, and the phone delivers the same caliber of photos with the wide-angle and tele lenses. The wide-angle camera has a greater field of view, and it produces better quality of photos than the Find N5.</p>

<p>Similarly, the Mate XT did a good job preserving color balance at 2x and 5.5x zoom, and you get a good amount of detail.</p>

<p>The biggest difference is with portrait shots; in this photo, the Mate XT got all the details right and correctly blurred out the background while having both phones visible, and it took several tries to get a similar result on the Find N5.</p>

<p>In a similar vein, the Mate XT does a great job in low-light situations, producing consistent colors and managing highlights well.</p>
<p>What's notable is how well the phone holds up against the Xiaomi 15 Ultra, which has one of the strongest camera packages of any 2025 device.</p>

<p>Xiaomi does a better job overall as the sensor is able to take in greater light, and the brand's camera tuning delivers cleaner photos with great vibrancy. That said, the Mate XT is pretty close, and that is praiseworthy.</p>

<p>The differences between the two is diminished in low-light scenarios, particularly when using the wide-angle lens.</p>

<p>On the whole, Huawei did an incredible job with the Mate XT. While the main attraction is clearly the panel that unfolds to a 10.2-inch tablet, the cameras and great battery life turn it into a fantastic daily driver. Yes, it is the costliest phone around — by a significant amount — but the device is an all-rounder like no other.</p>

<ul><li>Android now natively supports OpenID standards for digital credential presentation and issuance.</li><li>Users can securely store and send cryptographically verifiable digital documents across different apps.</li><li>This update enables wider use of digital credentials for various purposes, including account recovery and identity verification on different platforms.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google recently expanded its Digital ID access through its Wallet app for residents in the U.K. And to further expand the interoperability across different apps that store digital identities, the search giant is aiming to support open standards via various identity providers and services through the Android operating system.</p><p>Last week, through an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/04/announcing-android-support-of-digital-credentials.html?m=1">Android Developers blog post</a>, the company has announced that, “Android, via Credential Manager's DigitalCredential API, now natively supports OpenID4VP and OpenID4VCI for digital credential presentation and issuance respectively.”</p>
<p>As the search giant further explains, the Digital Credentials are cryptographically verifiable documents. They can include documents like driver's licenses, passports, or national IDs. And, through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-apps">Android apps</a> and with the help of the respective app developers, more can be incorporated and submitted digitally like education certifications, insurance policies, permits, for example in the near future.</p><p>Currently, the supported digital documents can be stored in "credential holders" apps like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet">Google Wallet</a> and Samsung Wallet. Some apps like banking or airline apps would, however, sometimes require the digital document for verification, which is not necessarily stored in the respective banking app.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3375px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="X7hXneZDSgYkAMBeaPL3ii" name="android-digital-credentials-selection-interface" alt="Android Digital Credentials selection interface" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/X7hXneZDSgYkAMBeaPL3ii.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3375" height="3375" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Since Android supports secure sharing between devices through CTAP protocols. Users will be able to store multiple credentials across apps and choose which one to pick using OpenID4VP requests from websites or Android Credential Manager API.</p><p>The process involves verifier sending an OpenID4VP request to the Digital Credential API, prompting the user to select a credential. The user here only chooses a credential, not a digital wallet app. Android then redirects the request to the digital wallet app holding the credential to complete the action. The app can further perform additional due diligence before releasing the credential.</p>

<p>Per the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pay/google-wallet-brings-digital-id-support-to-uk-and-other-us-states">Google Wallet announcement</a>, soon users can use digital credentials to recover "Amazon accounts, access online health services with CVS and MyChart by Epic, and verify profiles or identity on platforms like Uber and Bumble."</p><p>Next to Google Wallet, Samsung Wallet and 1Password will also be able to hold people's digital credentials as digital wallets and support OpenID standards through Android's Credential Manager API.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>One of the coolest things about Nothing’s CMF line of products is their modularity. By definition, this means that you can take parts off and readily replace them as you see fit. For products like the CMF Watch Pro 2, that means you can swap the bezels, not just the bands.</p><p>The CMF Phone 1 was even more modular, allowing you to easily drop on accessories via an external screw system, which also allowed you to remove the entire back and replace it with basically anything you could find. This caused an entire 3D-printed cottage industry to pop up on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/1812538797/custom-cmf-phone-1-rear-case-3d-printed">shops like Etsy</a>, making the CMF Phone 1 the coolest phone to debut in 2024.</p><p>However, the CMF Phone 2 Pro does things a little differently, and I didn’t realize that until it was too late. As I unboxed the phone, I took the time to unscrew the back and work on prying it off. The original phone’s back design wasn’t the easiest to get off, so I wasn’t surprised it took me a bit of work to remove this one, but I wasn’t expecting the plastic to crack the way it did as I got halfway through the process.</p>

<p>After conferring with my Nothing PR contact, the company confirmed that the back of the CMF Phone 2 Pro isn’t designed to be removable the way the CMF Phone 1 was.</p><p>Looking back at the spec sheet, it’s clear this is how Nothing improved the ingress protection (IP) rating of the phone, from IP52 on the CMF Phone 1 to IP54 on the CMF Phone 2. That number four in the rating means the CMF Phone 2 Pro can now withstand splashing of water from any direction, while Phone 1 was only resistant against water drops up to a 15-degree angle.</p><p>But none of this changes the fact that I now have a CMF Phone 2 Pro with a broken back and a need to order a replacement part.</p>

<p>Instead of the pain-in-the-butt removable back of the original — if you used it you’d know how difficult it was to remove — Nothing went with a “Universal cover” design featured in our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/cmf-phone-2-pro-review">CMF Phone 2 Pro review</a> by Android Central's Harish Jonnalagadda. This cover uses all five screws to attach to the back of the phone and not only enables the use of MagSafe accessories and several other official CMF magnetic accessories, but it also gives users the ability to click additional lenses onto the cameras.</p><p>The problem, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CMFTech/comments/1kbytl1/where_are_the_accessories_for_the_cmf_phone_2_pro/">users have already found out</a>, is that this case is not only difficult to find right after launch, but U.S. beta program users don’t seem to have access to it at all. As Nothing specifically told me, these accessories are “only available on Nothing.tech in Europe + UK with limited qty.”</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="4Pc9ySngqNcMkCJ5iJ3zzV" name="CMF Phone 2 Pro" alt="CMF Phone 2 Pro review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4Pc9ySngqNcMkCJ5iJ3zzV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That basically means it’s up to Etsy and the 3D printing community to save the CMF Phone 2 Pro’s proverbial butt since Nothing itself doesn’t seem to be making a lot of accessories for the phone. I’m relatively OK with this, as I think the community proved itself the first time around and can do it again, but it’s still disappointing to see such a major design change happen and a product not receive the support it needs out of the gate to make up for it.</p><p>Lesson learned: don’t take the back off your CMF Phone 2 Pro unless you’ve already got a replacement in hand. This semi-modular phone is going to be amazing once accessory makers get off the ground and get producing products for it. For now, at least, it’s still an incredible value-priced phone that’ll exceed any expectations you might have for what a sub-$300 phone is capable of.</p>

Garmin skimped on the Elevate v5 sensor and topo maps, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-2-solar-review">Instinct 2</a> owners still get dual-band GPS, built-in LEDs, sleep coach, training load focus, and a gyroscope on top of Garmin's usual training tools.</p><p>The problem? Garmin has reached an inflection point. Any groundbreaking features or mainstream smarts go to the $1,000 Fenix 8; then, Garmin withholds these features from "cheaper" models for years to prop up the flagships. That's why the Instinct 3 feels like a bulky Forerunner with a flashlight, with no "adventurer" tools.</p><p>Thankfully, anyone upgrading from a years-old Garmin watch shouldn't feel my dissatisfaction: The Instinct 3 is an impressive fitness watch on its own merits. But the AMOLED facelift aside, only hardcore Garmin fans who're lukewarm about mainstream "smarts" will want the Instinct 3.</p>

<p>The Garmin Instinct 3 ships in 45mm and 50mm sizes, each with AMOLED and MIP Solar variants. There are "Tactical" MIP and AMOLED models and a budget Instinct E MIP; so far, there's no Instinct 3 Surf, Dezl, or Camo edition, like the Instinct 2 had.</p><p>The Garmin Instinct 3 Solar costs $399 and $449 for the 0.9-inch and 1.1-inch models, respectively; the 1.2- and 1.3-inch Instinct 3 AMOLED cost $449 and $499.</p>

<p>My <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-3-vs-2x-vs-2">Garmin Instinct 3 vs. 2X vs. 2</a> guide breaks down specific feature differences. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-2x-solar-review">Instinct 2X Solar</a>, as a compromise upgrade, got 3rd-gen perks like multi-band GPS and the flashlight in 2023. Its solar recharging crushes the Instinct 2 Solar but falls well short of the 3 Solar.</p><p>The Instinct 3 AMOLED battery life is comparable to the Instinct 2 Solar's unless you regularly spend hours in direct sunlight to recharge. There <em>is</em> a weeks-long gap between the Instinct 3 Solar and AMOLED, if you can stomach the low-res, grayscale display.</p>

<p>The Garmin Instinct 3 AMOLED has double the pixels per inch as the grayscale Solar display. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitness-watches-mip-to-amoled-transition-long-overdue">MIP displays</a> are more readable outdoors but nearly illegible indoors. The AMOLED model is more readable at home while bright enough for outdoor treks, with no pressure to <em>seek out</em> sunlight to recharge.</p><p>Older Instincts (and new 3 Solar) tracked the same data, but their two-window, low-res displays lacked space for graphs, forcing users to use Garmin's mobile app to see their progress over time. This newest model solves that problem, making data more accessible.</p>

<p>The ten default watch faces all fit several data fields — like your steps, Body Battery, recovery time, heart rate, battery life, and the weather — saving you from searching for the data.</p><p>Unfortunately, you still rely on the Up/Down buttons to navigate the non-touch display. They're more consistent during workouts but feel slow when navigating through menus. Even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-165-review">Forerunner 165</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/leaked-garmin-vivoactive-6-looks-and-sounds-pretty-similar-to-its-predecessor">Vivoactive 6</a> have touch controls, so it's probably about battery efficiency, not cost.

<p>Display aside, the Instinct 3 sticks to the trademark bulky design you'd expect from this lineup. The raised bezel and thick, shockproof polymer protect the display and components from falls, while the 10ATM water resistance ensures the roughest water sports won't break through its shell.</p><p>The Instinct design may appeal to G-Shock fans who don't need premium materials. The new aluminum layer bisects the bezel and case so it doesn't look like one uniform heap of plastic, like past models. And I like my limited edition Neo Tropic finish: its muted greens feel at home in a forest.</p>

<p>Most people will find the Instinct 3 too <em>big</em> and buttoned to be attractive. The Instinct 2X flopped in my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-held-a-smartwatch-beauty-pageant-with-surprising-results">smartwatch beauty pageant</a>; even though the metal-edged Instinct 3 looks slightly better, it's still too bulky and athletic for most. Other Garmin watches can blend in more in professional contexts.</p><p>But if you ignore its looks, the Instinct 3 is more comfortable than you'd think. My 50mm model only weighs 59g, or 11g and 30g lighter than my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> 45mm and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> 47mm, respectively.</p>

<p>One of my biggest complaints with the last-gen Instincts was how <em>slow</em> the processor was. Noticeable lag accompanied every button press, making menu navigation a chore, and simple feature updates caused problems because of limited memory.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2025/01/garmin-instinct-3-in-depth-review-amoled-solar.html">DC Rainmaker</a> warns that the Instinct 3 Solar shares this issue since the system software takes up most of its 128MB of memory. I'm glad the Instinct 3 AMOLED has 4GB of space, with plenty of leeway.</p><p>The Instinct 3 still feels slower than other Garmin watches, even if it's faster than the Instinct 2. The missing touchscreen aside, every button press or uploaded workout has a tiny delay. But this sluggishness is the price paid to help the Instinct 3 last longer.</p>

<p>For context, the Forerunner 265 and Venu 3 last 13 or 14 days, respectively, while the Instinct 3 45mm and 50mm last 18 or 24 days. These other models aren't slouches, but an extra week makes a difference.</p><p>More importantly, the Instinct 3 lasts up to 30 hours in SatIQ mode with multi-band GPS, beating the Forerunner 265 by 14 hours, though losing to the Fenix 8 51mm by 32 hours.</p><p>Garmin's watches typically fall a few days or GPS hours short of the official battery estimates. On paper, you should only burn about 3% of your Instinct 3 battery per hour of activity; I observed at least 5%. But that's still significantly better than almost any other fitness watch I've tested!</p>

<p>The only true battery killer is the built-in flashlight. It has four white-LED intensity levels and a dimmer red LED; you can set any intensity to various strobe patterns to flash your presence, signaling your presence to cars and cyclists at night.</p><p>I've never cared to use Garmin's torch much. It's nice to whip out with a quick double-button tap to stumble to the bathroom, illuminate your pathway, or navigate a tent zipper without blinding others nearby. However, its max brightness can't match a typical phone flashlight, while still burning through your battery quickly.</p><p>I'd rather have it and not need it than the opposite. If your phone dies in an emergency, this flashlight is much better than the display flashlight mode on most watches. But if you regularly run at night, you'll still need a knuckle light or headlamp.</p>

<p>Garmin gave the Instinct 3 the same Elevate v4 sensor as the last few years of Garmin watches. While its multi-band GPS is industry-leading for accuracy, it hasn't changed much in recent years, aside from the SatIQ mode, which saves battery by only using multiple satellites when there's signal blockage.</p><p>All that is to say, if you've read any of my dozen Garmin reviews since 2022, there's nothing new to say here. I'll run through my results briefly, but the Instinct 3 is about as accurate as any other recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a>.</p>

<p>The Instinct 3's optical HR sensor did fairly well keeping up with an optical arm band, with only a little lag, and ended with the same average heart rate. But for a track workout, there's a more noticeable gap for anaerobic sprints, and it ended 1 bpm short.</p><p>That's better than most fitness watch brands and not a substantial difference for everyday athletes, but the Elevate v5 sensor in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review">Venu 3</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Fenix 8</a> is slightly more responsive.

<p>During the run, the dual-band Vantage M3 measured 0.01 miles or 16m more distance than the Instinct 3, which was using SatIQ mode. Polar's tracking was slightly more accurate at most points, while Garmin tended to drift off the trail a bit under light foliage while staying dead-on when unobstructed.</p><p>This is my typical experience with SatIQ mode, which doesn't always kick in with better accuracy quickly enough. But it also shows how Garmin's standard GPS tracking keeps pace with other brands' multi-band results, which is reassuring.</p>

<p>The map above shows me running three-mile-long loops on a set path with my Instinct 3. There's slight wavering at some points, whether because of foliage or having to run around people, but the tracking is dead-on in most cases.</p><p>If you own a GPS-only Garmin watch with older Elevate sensors, or if you switch from another brand, you'll be thrilled with this level of accuracy.

<p>Despite its extra memory and new display, the Instinct 3 isn't "smart." You won't find music storage, offline maps, Bluetooth calling, or commands. Its LiveTrack and emergency tools only work through your phone because it lacks an LTE option.</p><p>The Instinct 3's lightweight CPU helps it last longer, so I'm fine with most limitations. But I <em>fully</em> attribute its breadcrumb navigation to Garmin's rigid price tiers. Most recent AMOLED fitness watches in the $300+ range have started adding topographic maps, so you can download your regional data and follow nearby trails in an emergency. The Instinct 3 "adventure watch" should have done the same!</p>

It's easy to look at book-style foldables, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">Oppo Find N5</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>, as the premium option, with clamshell foldables serving as the more affordable entry into the market. When I first got into the foldable space, that's exactly what I thought.</p><p>My first purchase was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3</a>, and I quickly upgraded to the Galaxy Z Fold 4 as soon as I could afford it. Bigger must be better, and the more expensive one must be the best one, right? A few years later, after spending extended time with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold and Galaxy Z Fold 6 in my pocket, I can't believe how wrong I was.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kCFoS9NbMAUwvfELWfypJ9" name="Google-Pixel-9-Pro-Fold-Main-Screen" alt="The Pixel 9 Pro Fold's main screen open in hand." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kCFoS9NbMAUwvfELWfypJ9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>No matter how much I <em>want</em> to love having a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">giant foldable</a> in my pocket, I just don't end up using it. The cover screen gets used about 90% of the time, and the 10% that I use the large main screen ends up feeling like a chore. Neither option is as ergonomically sound as, say, using a clamshell foldable or a normal flagship.</p><p>All these experiences added up over years testing foldables. Eventually, they came to a head when I took my main SIM out of the Pixel 9 Pro Fold (my then-daily driver) to test the Nothing Phone 3a Pro and the Pixel 9a. After a few weeks without the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, I simply realized I didn't want to go back. Here's why.</p>
<h2 id="everything-book-style-foldables-get-wrong-and-right-2">Everything book-style foldables get wrong (and right)</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TbXMRzhz2TDzGYuePc9DtL" name="Phone-Form-Factor-Comparison-3" alt="Foldable phones compared across form factors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TbXMRzhz2TDzGYuePc9DtL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Pixel 9 Pro Fold doesn't offer as much extra space for video as you might expect. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's objectively true that book-style foldables offer more screen real estate than typical flagships and clamshells. However, whether that extra space will be useful to you will depend on what exactly you plan to do with it. I hoped to use my assortment of large foldables — including two generations each of Galaxy Z Fold and Pixel Fold models — for superior media consumption. In theory, everything from movies to YouTube videos should pop.</p><p>This led to my biggest let-down of using foldables. Due to the widescreen nature of most long-form video, using a Pixel 9 Pro Fold or Galaxy Z Fold 6 didn't make my content that much larger, as you can see in the photo above. The average video on a Pixel 9 Pro Fold is just marginally bigger than what you'd get from a standard <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>. Of course, you can crop in, but you'll lose a massive chunk of content — it becomes borderline unenjoyable.</p><p>So, the big-screen foldables weren't the content-consumption powerhouses I had hoped. What about other use cases that <em>should </em>benefit from a larger screen, like productivity and gaming? They were similarly underwhelming.</p><p>Both the Pixel 9 Pro Fold and the Galaxy Z Fold 6 suffered from odd aspect ratios and poor user interfaces, and typing is specifically difficult on the Pixel's wide form factor. Productivity apps aren't truly tapping into the big screens on large foldables, and Chrome <em>still</em> refuses to load many websites in true desktop mode. You could make the case that it should do this by default when the main screen is opened, like how it works on an iPad mini.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="F4nXdS8W3Q2CdCuPuq8dLn" name="Two-Apps-Pixel-Fold" alt="Multitasking on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/F4nXdS8W3Q2CdCuPuq8dLn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I will say that the excellent productivity feature on both the Pixel 9 Pro Fold and the Galaxy Z Fold 6 is opening two apps in split-screen mode. You can do this on many Android phones, but doing so on a large foldable with the main screen open effectively gives you two separate windows the size of the cover screen. It's amazing for times when you need to view multiple screens or apps at the same time to work.</p><p>That said, gaming was largely disappointing for me for a few reasons. On a Pixel 9 Pro Fold, it's clear that the Tensor G4 chip inside is holding the device back. Games like Fortnite, which can run on something as lowly as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/this-is-how-nintendo-aims-to-stop-switch-2-emulation">Nintendo Switch</a>, struggle to hit decent frame rates with subpar graphics. Meanwhile, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 is a much better performer, but still requires a separate controller to be great.</p><p>Not for lack of trying, I can't find a "killer" feature" of big foldables that makes me want to carry one daily.</p>
<h2 id="book-foldables-are-jacks-of-all-trades-master-of-none-2">Book foldables are jacks of all trades, master of none</h2>

<p>It's clear that book-style foldables, like the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Pixel 9 Pro Fold, are what we call a "jack of all trades." They can be a normal phone when you need them to be, and a tablet when you want a bigger screen. They make calls, handle spreadsheets, take photos, and can even play some games.</p><p>However, they're not excellent at <em>any</em> of those things. After using both for months at a time, I'm convinced the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Pixel 9 Pro Fold — and big foldables in general — are jacks of all trades, but masters of none.</p><p>I've tried to make large foldables fit into my life and workflow for three full years, starting on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4</a>'s release date. Now, I'm certain that I would rather have the right device for the task at hand than one that tries to do it all in a way that's just fine.</p><p>You can buy a new Google Pixel 9, a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Pixel Tablet</a>, and a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/these-smart-glasses-really-saved-my-neck">Steam Deck</a> for the same price or less than a Galaxy Z Fold 6 or Pixel 9 Pro Fold at retail, and I'd absolutely choose those three excellent products over a foldable. While I might give <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-series-hands-on">clamshell foldables</a> another shot in the near future, I think it's safe to say that I'm done using a book-style foldable as my daily driver.</p>

<p>AI can be fun to play around with, but it's only truly useful if you know when to use it. Specifically, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-lives-video-streaming-screen-sharing-support-comes-to-pixel-9-series">Gemini Live's camera features</a> offer the most utility when you have something right in front of you that you're not sure how to describe. Maybe it's a piece of furniture in a coffee shop you don't know the name of, or a monument with a faded plaque. In these situations, typing a written prompt into a chatbot or a search engine won't do you any good.</p><p>That's where you'd want to turn on your camera in Gemini Live. It'll help out in many situations, including identifying plants. I picked up a few small potted plants from Ikea and turned to Gemini Live to figure out exactly what they were and how to care for them. Here's how Gemini responded, based on pointing my camera at the plant:</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>That looks like an aloe vera plant! Is there anything you'd like to know about aloe vera care?</p><figcaption><cite>Gemini Live</cite></figcaption></blockquote></figure>
<p>While this is all happening off-device, Gemini returned the answer pretty fast. Sure enough, it looks like an aloe vera plant. After that, I took the AI assistant up on its offer to enlighten me on care options. Here's what it said:</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Sure, aloe vera plants are easy to care for. They need bright, sunny spots and well-drained soil. You should let the soil dry out between watering. During the spring and summer, you'll want to water it about every two weeks. In the fall and winter, you can cut back to about once a month.</p><figcaption><cite>Gemini Live</cite></figcaption></blockquote></figure>
<p>The responses were clear and concise, and they ended up saving me a ton of time researching care instructions for a plant I wasn't even sure the name of a few minutes earlier.</p>
<h2 id="it-ll-come-up-with-care-options-for-your-plants-too-2">It'll come up with care options for your plants, too</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CfxY5HjEPrXfrXTvWK6u2W" name="Gemini-Live-Plants-4" alt="Using Gemini Live to grow plants and diagnose problems." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CfxY5HjEPrXfrXTvWK6u2W.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-rolls-out-new-gemini-live-experience-with-saved-audio-recordings">Gemini Live</a> were only able to identify plants by looking at them, it would be cool, but it wouldn't be groundbreaking. The killer feature here is the care instructions that Gemini can provide just by looking at a plant. To test this, I showed it a live camera feed of my basil plant and asked how I should take care of it, and Gemini replied with the following:</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>That's a nice basil plant! It needs about six hours of sunlight each day, so a sunny spot is perfect. You should water it when the top inch of soil feels dry, and make sure the pot has good drainage. Do you have a sunny spot in mind for it?</p><figcaption><cite>Gemini Live</cite></figcaption></blockquote></figure>
<p>I then told Gemini I was planning to keep the basil out on my balcony, and it seemed to like the idea.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>A balcony is a great spot! Basil thrives with six to eight hours of direct sunlight each day. Just make sure to bring it inside if the temperature drops below 50 degrees or rises above 90 degrees Fahrenheit.</p><figcaption><cite>Gemini Live</cite></figcaption></blockquote></figure>
<p>The cool thing about going "live" with Gemini is that you can easily provide context or follow-up questions in real time. For example, when the AI suggested I bring it inside when the temperature drops, I could let Gemini know that it won't be an issue in my climate. It's easy to get context-specific advice when using your camera with Gemini Live.</p>

<p>By far, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/gemini-live-real-time-screen-sharing-now-available-to-all-android-users">Gemini Live's</a> most useful capability is diagnosing problems you might run into with your plants. As I mentioned earlier, I'm new to growing plants in the desert, and it's a learning curve. Since the sun is so intense and the temperature can exceed 120 degrees Fahrenheit, the climate is unforgiving. I was bound to run into issues, and Gemini Live helped me navigate them.</p><p>In one case, my hydroponic jalapeño and tomato plants were having a hard time. The jalapeño leaves were browning, and the tomatoes just weren't turning red. It was Gemini that suggested my apartment's temperature could be the problem, and sure enough, after turning up the heat for a few days, the tomatoes ripened. It also identified health problems with my plants, as explained in the reply below:</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Your jalapeño plant looks like it might have a few issues. The leaves are curling and have some brown spots, which could be from overwatering or a nutrient deficiency. The tomatoes also look like they might have blossom end rot, which is caused by a calcium deficiency. Do you have any plant fertilizer on hand?</p><figcaption><cite>Gemini Live</cite></figcaption></blockquote></figure>
<p>It's important to remember that while you're reading the transcript of my conversation with Gemini, this is all being spoken to me in real-time — the same way you'd have a conversation with another person.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2u42Umpxe3p5YtqGi2Y93V" name="Gemini-Live-Plants-3" alt="Using Gemini Live to grow plants and diagnose problems." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2u42Umpxe3p5YtqGi2Y93V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I realized <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/how-use-gemini-live-camera-screen-sharing">Gemini Live's multimodal features</a> were the real deal when it noticed that I was using an AeroGarden hydroponic system just from the information it could see via my camera feed. After picking up on that information, I received tailored care instructions as follows:</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Okay, great. You can try adding a balanced liquid fertilizer to the water in your AeroGarden, following the instructions on the label. That should help with any nutrient issues. For the blossom end rot on the tomatoes, you can try adding a calcium supplement to the water.</p><figcaption><cite>Gemini Live</cite></figcaption></blockquote></figure>
<p>While I might usually dive into gardening books, research studies, or Reddit threads for hours to solve these types of problems, everything you see in this article happened within just a few minutes.</p><p>Often, plant growing problems can show the same symptoms, making them hard to diagnose, especially when you're just getting started. Gemini was vital in helping me overcome them.</p>

<p>If you've gotten this far and aren't as excited by Gemini's gardening prowess as I am, fear not. This is just one way Gemini Live can help you out in your daily life, and there are many more. I used Gemini to solve problems with my plants, but in the tech world, we simply call that troubleshooting.</p><p>You could follow the exact same steps for just about anything else you need to figure out. In Google's first-ever demo of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-project-starline-astra-ar-glasses">Project Astra at Google I/O 2024</a>, it used the technology to troubleshoot a finicky record player. These are exactly the kinds of things AI can be great at — it is trained on material that includes user manuals, textbooks, and even online forums. You can tap into the online history of the internet without doing any of the work.</p><p>So, before you write off Gemini Live, give its new multimodal camera support a try. When you find <em>your</em> use case for it, it'll become invaluable.</p>

<p>This year, it will be five years since LG launched what’s considered its last flagship smartphone. The LG Wing was a very unique device featuring a swivel design that you won’t really find anywhere else, and probably for good reason. The novel design was one that turned heads, but surprisingly (or maybe not), the LG Wing ultimately failed to garner enough attention to keep LG in the game. The following year, LG announced it was leaving the smartphone business.</p><p>I’ve been holding onto the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/lg-wing-review">LG Wing</a> for the past five years, and it was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.lg.com/tw/support/announcement/TWNTC2025041101/?cjdata=MXxOfDB8WXww&cjevent=2dd6379727a011f080ac009b0a1cb828&utm_source=cj-affiliate-2470763&utm_medium=affiliate">recently announced</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/lg-smartphone-updates-3548804/">Android Authority</a>) that LG will soon shut down its update service, meaning that anyone still using an LG phone will soon no longer be able to update it.</p><p>Fortunately, I’ve managed to keep my Wing updated (as much as possible) over the years. It's mostly been collecting dust in a drawer all the time, so as a self-proclaimed former LG fanboy, I recently decided to revisit this unique device and take it for a spin now that it's been some time since LG bowed out.</p>
<h2 id="the-wing-had-some-interesting-ideas-2">The Wing had some interesting ideas</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Rfs9TCRaKLSTn569Fewe5a" name="LG-Wing-revisit-2025-01" alt="The LG Wing main swivel screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Rfs9TCRaKLSTn569Fewe5a.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The LG Wing came at a time when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> were still getting off the ground. They weren't as popular as they are today, and companies were still working out the hardware and software intricacies that came with building foldables. That's where the Wing came in, offering an alternative for anyone who worried about the longevity of a folding display.</p><p>At the time, I thought LG was smart to forgo the potential costs associated with developing a foldable phone. Instead, the company leaned on the latest (and eventually final) evolution of the Second Screen concept it had been pushing on consumers for years.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3953px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="YR5ZHN2Y8LPgCycMXLsnqY" name="LG-Wing-revisit-2025-16" alt="The LG Wing next to a bush" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YR5ZHN2Y8LPgCycMXLsnqY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3953" height="2224" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The idea was fairly simple in concept: you can use the phone as you regularly would on its primary display, but then you could reveal a secondary screen whenever you needed it. It stayed out of sight until it was needed, which I really appreciated.</p><p>LG also had some ideas of how this second screen could be used. Apps could utilize both displays in unique ways, which actually made a fair amount of sense. For instance, when the main display was swiveled up, I could watch a YouTube video in full view on the horizontal screen while the various video controls remained on the second screen underneath. This made it easy to adjust volume, brightness, skip forward, and more.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3906px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="gMmJXW9YYJYzFLMyeBbri6" name="LG-Wing-revisit-2025-19" alt="YouTube on the LG Wing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gMmJXW9YYJYzFLMyeBbri6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3906" height="2197" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The other use for the second screen was multitasking. My favorite use case was always using Google Maps on the primary display to navigate, while the second screen would be used to control music.</p><p>Of course, there's much more you can do with it, so long as you're okay with some apps being squished down to the almost-square aspect ratio. But to me, this made me think of multitasking in ways I never considered before. Since I'm not a fan of using split screen on standard candybar phones, this gave me another option that I much preferred.</p><p>LG also had a fun mouse function that let you use the second screen to control the main display.</p>

<p>Then there's the camera. LG did something pretty unique by adding a secondary ultrawide "Gimbal Motion Camera" that's rotated 90-degrees and would work when the phone is in Swivel Mode. Basically, this allowed the users to move the viewfinder around without needing to physically move the sensor and helped stabilize videos in a similar way to an actual gimbal camera system.</p><p>It's a unique way to take advantage of the phone's unique form factor, as you can simply hold the phone by the second screen for more stable handling of the phone when recording. It also potentially saves you from having to purchase a separate smartphone gimbal.</p>

<p>I will say that I was thoroughly surprised at the photo quality from the main wide and ultrawide sensors. I was always a fan of LG's video capabilities, but photo quality always left a lot to be desired on previous LG phones I've used, so it was good to see LG improve on this front with the Wing.</p><p>In the LG Wing review, it was noted how the primary camera "goes toe-to-toe with some of the best Android cameras out there, with impressive dynamic range and color clarity, plus minimal noise even in darker conditions." I wouldn't say that LG could compete with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-camera">best Android cameras of 2025</a>, but it certainly wasn't bad for 2020.</p><p>Unfortunately, camera improvements and a novel smartphone form factor were not enough to save the Wing or LG.</p>
<h2 id="too-many-compromises-2">Too many compromises</h2>

<p>Ultimately, the LG Wing was a flop. I can't say whether it was a result of the COVID-19 pandemic that saw consumers making fewer non-essential spending choices or just the overall reception of the LG Wing and its admittedly cool but strange design. Either way, the phone did not resonate with consumers.</p><p>For one, the phone was expensive at launch for what you got. It cost $999 but featured a squarely mid-range Snapdragon chipset usually reserved for cheaper smartphones. By comparison, the more conventional <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/lg-v60-thinq-5g-review">LG V60</a> cost less, featured a more powerful flagship Snapdragon chipset, and had a larger battery, making it feel like a better deal.</p><p>But more than that, it felt like LG was trying to do the absolute most with the absolute least, and the payoff just wasn't there.</p>
<div class="inlinegallery  inline-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="m6VMc5GUBRMfR5p3oYeU7a" name="LG-Wing-revisit-2025-07" alt="The LG Wing with Google Search on the Swivel screen and the LG keyboard on the Second screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/m6VMc5GUBRMfR5p3oYeU7a.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3948px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="nmDUw3MNF5TJbGrSw6mWxZ" name="LG-Wing-revisit-2025-08" alt="The LG Wing with Gboard on the Swivel screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nmDUw3MNF5TJbGrSw6mWxZ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3948" height="2221" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div>
<p>LG wasn't known for having the best software, and while I never particularly minded it, many considered the UI to be behind Samsung's One UI and others. That said, it feels like LG is stretching itself thin trying to get the Wing to work properly.</p><p>Switching from regular to Swivel mode and back feels janky, adding apps to the Second Screen is more cumbersome than it needs to be, and Gboard can't be used properly in Swivel mode; only LG keyboard will work on the Second Screen, which kinda misses the point if I have to use Gboard on the primary display while in swivel mode.</p><p>Samsung has a similar limitation on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/24-hours-using-only-the-motorola-razr-and-galaxy-z-flip-cover-screens">Galaxy Z Flip 6 cover screen</a>, where I can <em>only</em> use Samsung Keyboard, and it's a key annoyance for me.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Software and support were some of the biggest issues with the Wing.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>That highlights a key problem with Swivel Mode on the LG Wing: as cool as it was, it also felt woefully underutilized. LG just didn't garner the kind of app support that was needed to fully take advantage of it. At launch, it leaned heavily on YouTube, the Whale browser, and an optimized version of Asphalt 9 to show off how apps could utilize the second screen, but the selection remained lacking throughout its lifecycle.</p><p>This left multitasking as the main function for the second screen, which wasn't enough of a draw for this phone.</p><p>LG was also known for not having the best update cadence or policy, which also didn't help the Wing's case. Funnily enough, I feel like it improved after LG <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/its-official-lg-exiting-smartphone-business">announced</a> its departure from the smartphone market, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/lg-wing-android-13-update">the Wing has since received three OS upgrades</a> up to Android 13.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3185px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="sPZX3Kp7QYKroQSsshKHCY" name="LG-Wing-revisit-2025-12" alt="The LG Wing with two apps next to each other" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sPZX3Kp7QYKroQSsshKHCY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3185" height="1792" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Then there's the gimbal camera, which was cool in theory, but was always the phone's weakest point for me. I wanted to really like it, but the video quality was never particularly good, to the point where I would just stick to the main wide and ultrawide sensors. It didn't help that video was capped at FHD in Gimbal Mode, and the result was a surprisingly noisy and just not good.</p><p>The Wing had an opportunity to take my video, my favorite thing about LG phones, and really do something cool, but in the end, it just fell flat.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3730px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9C38DDDccCVnryG7Uv8LqY" name="LG-Wing-revisit-2025-09" alt="The LG Wing selfie camera" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9C38DDDccCVnryG7Uv8LqY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3730" height="2098" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Holding the phone years later, I also can't help but notice how the Wing also just feels surprisingly un-LG in a weird way. The unique form factor was a very LG thing to do, but the compromises felt a bit uncharacteristic, such as the lack of stereo speakers and a 3.5mm headphone jack. Even the design choices, with a curved display, fingerprint magnet on the back panel, and noisy pop-up selfie camera, make the phone feel like it was built by a different company.</p><p>The phone is also heavy (at 260g, it's heavier than even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>), only features an IP54 water and dust resistance rating, and the fingerprint sensor is very slow.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3984px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PgcyUaFBk3UaRXcMyFJijY" name="LG-Wing-revisit-2025-06" alt="The LG Wing with fingerprints all over its back glass panel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PgcyUaFBk3UaRXcMyFJijY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3984" height="2241" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>LG was great at standing out with its experimental phones, and the Wing was clearly never meant to be a huge hit, but LG made some odd choices that I feel ensured it wouldn't do well.</p><p>That said, I can't help but feel like some of what we got with the LG Wing helped prepare me for foldables, particularly flip phones.</p>
<h2 id="prepping-me-for-foldables-2">Prepping me for foldables</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4194px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Sjjgt7tJPUoNDibaCGH4LZ" name="LG-Wing-revisit-2025-13" alt="The LG Wing next to the Razr Plus 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Sjjgt7tJPUoNDibaCGH4LZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4194" height="2359" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Foldables weren't my thing back in 2020, but with the resurgence of the Motorola Razr, I've gone all-in on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phones</a>. It's a familiar design that spans generations, and now with modern smartphone technology, it can live on in a much-smarter and user-friendly way. Where LG tried to differentiate itself with the Wing, modern flip phones relied heavily on the past to gain popularity.</p><p>Still, I think the Wing was onto something with its smaller second screen. This wasn't meant to be a primary way of interacting with the phone, but an optional way for users to get a little extra out of their devices.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4036px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="atKEe6BRiJzUQ8oDGuPknZ" name="LG-Wing-revisit-2025-03" alt="The LG Wing Second Screen next to the Razr Plus 2025 cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/atKEe6BRiJzUQ8oDGuPknZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4036" height="2270" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Modern flagship flip phones take a similar approach, yet they make the smaller cover screen a first option as a way to quickly get through notifications, messages, and more. Then, if and when necessary, you can open the device to reveal a regular-sized smartphone.</p><p>With this in mind, I can't help but think LG would have done better to opt for a flip phone form factor than to try and reinvent the wheel with a Swivel phone. It may have taken a generation or two to really take off, but given the growing popularity of the Razr and Galaxy Z Flip lineups, maybe we would still have LG around to keep us on our toes with other unique devices like the unreleased <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/lg-rollable-hands-on-video">Rollable phone</a>.</p>

<p>Maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. If you're a software developer interested in Google's consumer products, or if you are interested in becoming one, then it is for you. If you're a regular Jane or Joe, like most of us, then it's a couple of days of talk about tokens and APIs with a tiny bit of interesting stuff sprinkled through.</p><p>It's my job to pay attention, and I still love to dabble with development, but even I get overwhelmed. Not that I'm some sort of tech Superman, but I am closer to the actual <em>intended</em> audience than most.</p>
<p>Don't worry though, because after all these years I have figured out exactly how to digest what's cool and different coming from Google's annual developer conference: don't pay a lot of attention to it.</p>

<p>Really, I'm serious. If you're a bit of a nerd, then the keynote and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16" target="_blank"><em>What's New in Android</em></a> presentations can be fun to watch, but be prepared to hear about stuff like those tokens, limits, AI engines, and analytical training for most of the hour.</p><p>Let people like me, who are forced to watch and pay attention, do it. Then we tell you about it, without all the tech-nerd gobbly-goo. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-teases-a-special-i-o-edition-of-the-android-show">Anything cool</a> will be all over your favorite tech websites; we'll be covering it extensively because it's what we at Android Central do best. We might even get a little nerdy from time to time (I forgive you if you don't read my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/installing-android-sdk-windows-mac-and-linux-tutorial">I/O nerd articles</a>).</p><p>When everything is said and done we will have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-biggest-announcements">complete wrap-up of everything announced</a> as well as the gems that get hidden in the individual sessions. So will other Android websites, or general tech sites like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/tech" target="_blank">The Verge</a>.</p><p>Read all of those. If it sounds cool, read it twice, even. Then, be prepared to never see any of it materialize so that when some of it does happen, it's a pleasant surprise. Cynical, but healthy.</p>

<p>Like I said earlier, Google I/O isn't for you. Really, even the stuff about what's coming in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> isn't for you. On its surface, it is meant to get developers ready, but at its core, it's all done for the shareholders.</p><p>Like it or not, all businesses work this way, and Google isn't an exception. Every single decision has to start with "How does this affect share value?" or eventually there will be no decisions to make because there will be no Google to make them.</p><p>What Google has planned for its own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-vs-pixel-9-pro">Pixel phones</a> is often cool as heck, and sometimes we even get to see some of it rub off on the software from other companies. If you <em>really</em> want to know about Android 16 for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a>, for example, you should watch Samsung's developer conference.</p><p>Either way, hearing about it can be fun. Learning about it without sitting through the slog and trying to pay attention is even better.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Smartwatch charging is a mess, with a different proprietary cable for every brand. Lose your watch cable on a trip, and you're waiting a week for an expensive replacement or hoping a knock-off Amazon cable works. However, the fitness watch brand COROS has found a unique solution to the dilemma of charging cable for watches.</p><p>When COROS launched its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-pace-pro-review">PACE Pro watch</a>, it replaced its usual three-pin cable with a tiny USB-C dongle; you insert a USB-C cable into it, then plug the dongle's pins into your watch. This way, you don't need to keep a phone <em>and</em> watch charging cable on hand — just slide the dongle onto your phone cable every couple of weeks when the battery dies.</p><p>That "A2" dongle was PACE Pro-exclusive, but this new "USB-C to COROS A1 Charging Adapter" works with the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-pace-3-review">PACE 3</a> and 2, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-apex-2-review">APEX 2</a> and 2 Pro, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-vertix-2s-vs-garmin-forerunner-965-vs-polar-vantage-v3-fitness-test">VERTIX 2S</a> and 2. I also assume future COROS watches will match the A1 adapter, making it the universal option.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="EquUBYynGwXpfU2PpfeU88" name="Coros-usb-c-adapter-plugged-into-pace-3-watch" alt="The USB-C to COROS A1 Charging Adapter with a USB-C cable plugged into it, plugged into a COROS PACE 3 smartwatch." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EquUBYynGwXpfU2PpfeU88.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is still a "proprietary" charging solution, so you're screwed if you lose this tiny adapter; from experience, it's very easy for people to assume it's trash and toss it. Thankfully, COROS bundled it with a key ring holder so you can latch it onto a backpack and never lose track of it.</p><p>I'd love to see other fitness watch brands emulate COROS's approach. Garmin, Polar, Amazfit, Suunto, Fitbit, and other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watch</a> brands each have unique connectors, so they'd each need their own adapters. But I'd still prefer a tiny, distinct adapter so that I can keep another (more useful) USB-C cable plugged into my charging brick at all times.</p><p>I suspect that we'll eventually see more watches adopt the Qi2 wireless charging instead, which would arguably be an even better "universal" charging option. But COROS piggybacking on the USB-C standard is the next best thing.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6vK9MH3VxuccFPa6VrwzRa" name="Tangled-chargers.jpeg" alt="Charging cables for the Apple Watch, Amazfit Band 7, Galaxy Watch 5 Pro, Fitbit Sense, Amazfit GTS 2, COROS APEX 2, and Garmin Forerunner 955." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6vK9MH3VxuccFPa6VrwzRa.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A couple of years back, I asked Jitesh Ubrani, IDC's research manager of worldwide device trackers, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wearable-charging-is-an-unsolvable-mess">why smartwatch charging is such an unsolvable mess</a> and whether the EU should step in for a universal standard, just as they forced Apple to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-usb-c-confirmed">drop Lightning for USB-C</a>.</p><p>He explained that "wearables come in far too many shapes and sizes" for a universal standard to make sense.</p><p>If every watch had to use a Qi charging coil, for example, it would "stifle innovation" and "do more harm than good," particularly to smaller brands that design their watches to prioritize other perks like larger batteries.</p><p>Ubrani said that wireless charging would become "more ubiquitous in the coming years as costs come down and power consumption amongst smartwatches is reduced." But fitness watch brands stick with the status quo because slower charging isn't a big deal when your watch lasts 1–3 weeks.</p><p>So, until that distant future when wireless charging makes sense to fitness brands, COROS's adapter is the next best thing.</p>

<p>At the moment, Apple and Galaxy Watches use magnetized wireless charging cables, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/pixel-watch-4-renders-leak-indicate-thicker-build-and-removal-of-charging-pins">leaked Pixel Watch 4 renders</a> suggest that Google will ditch its current pin-charging system for wireless charging. However, they don't follow a particular standard, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-wireless-charging-standard">Qi2 wireless charging</a>, so they're not interchangeable.</p><p>Switching between Android and iOS isn't particularly common, but it would be nice if all the mainline <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android watches</a> and Apple Watches used interchangeable Qi2 chargers.</p><p>Qi2 supports fast wireless charging and a strong magnetized fit, making it less likely that your watch fails to charge because you didn't seat it properly. Plus, if you switch brands, your old charging cable doesn't suddenly become useless e-waste. Instead, it could charge other Qi-compliant devices.</p><p>Because these watches all use similar processors and hardware, I doubt it would be particularly onerous for any one brand to use an industry-standard charging coil. And because they only last a couple of days per charge, prioritizing faster charging is more important for these watches, anyway.</p><p>As long as using Qi2 wouldn't prevent watches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-review">OnePlus Watch 3</a> from hitting <em>faster</em> charging speeds, I don't see any downside to a more consistent universal watch standard. But since most brands would prefer the flexibility of their own unique charging solutions, I doubt will see this happen anytime soon.</p>

<p>This is Android Central's News Weekly, your go-to source for a concise roundup of the week's most significant tech stories. This is where we delve into the top headlines that provide the latest developments and innovations contributing to the digital landscape.</p><p>This week saw some major leaks, Android 16's alleged redesign, Galaxy S25's launch date and full specs leak, U.K. residents get access to Google's digital IDs,  Samsung teases its new foldable, and Meta's Q1 earnings show major AI priority shift. Let's dive in.</p>
<h2 id="android-16-s-ui-redesign-pops-up-in-a-leak-2">Android 16's UI redesign pops up in a leak</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:835px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.81%;"><img id="Bo4FVrk5YDhLtnTepV9Jya" name="android-16-lockscreen-redesign-leaked-look" alt="Android 16's code teases a lock screen redesign, that alters the clock font slightly and places the date/temp under it when there are no notifications." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Bo4FVrk5YDhLtnTepV9Jya.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="835" height="466" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>See all the UI changes </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-ui-icons-panel-redesign-leak"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>This week gave us a first look at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/android-16">Android 16</a>'s redesign and it comes from Mishaal Rahman. He seems to have stumbled on these UI changes while digging through Android 16's Beta 4. Rahman notices some changes to the shapes of app icons, stating that the OS could bring more "geometric" shape options, as well as the standard circle.</p><p>Rahman found choices like a square, a "four-sided cookie," and a "seven-sided cookie." Next up is the notification panel which could get a blurred/transparent user interface. The tiles within the panel also seem to have gotten a more rounded- bubble like appearance.</p><p>The lock screen also might get a fresh coat of paint. Rahman's snapshots show Google may alter the font of the clock while moving the date and temperature beneath it. If there are notifications, the clock will still move to the top left; however, the date/temp information will be featured on its right side, not under it.</p><p>Additionally, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-to-bring-a-dynamic-battery-indicator">battery icon may see a pop of color</a> as Google could ditch the old colorless icon for a horizontal battery with its percentage and a color-coded background.</p>

Meta said these losses were "due to lower <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/meta-quest">Meta Quest</a> sales" but "partially offset" by tripled Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses sales.</p><p>Meta's "five major opportunities" for further growth include using AI to build better ad campaigns, recommending more relevant social media and video content via AI, and creating "AI business agents that can do customer support and sales" in apps like WhatsApp and Messenger.</p><p>Lastly, speaking about its challenges, Meta said it's concerned about the EU ruling stating that its "subscription for no ads model is not compliant with the Digital Markets Act (DMA)."
