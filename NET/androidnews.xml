<hr>
<p>MediaTek announces a brand new SoC designed to "raise the bar" of flagship smartphone performance.</p><p>In a press release, the Taiwanese OEM states the new 3nm process Dimensity 9400 Plus SoC takes what <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-announces-dimensity-9400-flagship-chip">the original 9400</a> did and builds upon it. To begin, the company explains its core structure, which features a Big Core design. With one Arm Cortex-X925 core at 3.73GHz, 3x Cortex-X4 cores, and 4x Cortex-A720 cores, MediaTek claims this chip will propel Android UX experiences.</p><p>The Dimensity 9400 Plus chip features integration with the 12-core Arm Immortalis-G925 GPU. MediaTek states this GPU enables "PC-level features to smartphones with opacity micromap support for realistic effects." In short, the Dimensity 9400 Plus should help bring a more lifelike experience to vegetation, character hair, and animal feathers. These upgrades bring a 40% power efficiency boost to MediaTek's latest chip.</p><p>Additionally, this GPU is said to "double" the effective FPS for phones and boost the chip's power efficiency by 50% for game developers. MediaTek appears confident that this GPU will help reduce gaming lag for users who are playing over longer periods.</p>

<p>As you might expect, MediaTek isn't holding back with its AI advancements with the Dimensity 9400 Plus. The post states the latest upgraded chip brings "exceptional edge-AI performance." Thanks to the NPU 890, the 9400 Plus supports the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-you-need-to-know-about-deepseek">DeepSeek R1</a> LLM for on-device assistance. MediaTek states its chip is "the first" to incorporate support for R1's four technologies: Mixture of-Experts, Multi-Head Latent Attention, Multi-Token Prediction, and FP8.</p><p>Incorporating these is said to boost the AI's "reasoning speeds." The OEM also worked to improve the chip's generative AI models by 20% over the O.G. 9400.</p><p>In a statement, a MediaTek member said, "The MediaTek Dimensity 9400+ will allow developers to deliver innovative, personalized AI experiences on-device, offering a number of speed and privacy benefits." The chip's built-in Dimensity Agentic AI Engine gives developers an entry point into "sophisticated" agentic AI apps.</p>

<p>There's more to the Dimensity 9400 Plus, such as its focus on enhancing the video recording experience for future users. MediaTek says its chip features Imagiq 1090 for HDR video recording "across the entire zoom range." The company pairs this with its Smooth Zoom technology for "seamless capture" of moving subjects.</p><p>Extra specs include the chip's inclusion of BeiDou satellite connection, which is 60% faster for users looking to utilize its capabilities with your cell signal drops. Phone-to-phone direct Bluetooth connections expand to 8km, which is roughly four times greater than the Dimensity 9400. Consumers will also be able to take advantage of 5G/4G dual-SIM and even greater Wi-Fi coverage.</p><p>MediaTek says its Dimensity 9400 Plus SoC will be available by Q2 2025 for the next wave of smartphones.</p>

<ul><li>Xiaomi announces its Android 16 Developer Preview Program for those creating apps for its upcoming upgrade.</li><li>The preview will provide developers with the tools needed to develop their apps to sort of issues, but it's only accepting the Xiaomi 15 and 14T Pro models.</li><li>Google recently achieved "Platform Stability" with Android 16, meaning its on track to deliver the next major OS in Q2.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Xiaomi is in the early stages of Android 16 development, and those creating apps can get a head start, too.</p><p>The Chinese OEM <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mi.com/global/support/guidance/androidtbeta">announced</a> the start of its Android 16 Developer Preview Program for early app development (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://locationtrackinghub.com/global-android-16-based-hyperos-2-beta/">Location Tracking Hub</a>). Similar to Google, Xiaomi is encouraging interested developers to take part in its preview program, which provides all the tools they will need to "improve the compatibility" and develop their Android 16-supported apps. Interested parties are restricted to a pair of phones to start.</p><p>Xiaomi states its developer preview is accepting the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15">Xiaomi 15</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14t-pro-review">the 14T Pro</a>.</p><p>The announcement post states developers can get started in one of two ways: a local update or a fastboot update. For the former, devs must ensure their Xiaomi 15 is running OS2.0.109.0.VOCMIXM or higher. Owners of a 14T Pro need to have installed OS2.0.103.0.VNNMIXM or higher. The company has provided a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mi.com/global/support/guidance/androidtbeta#:~:text=use%20it%20immediately.-,How%20to%20upgrade%EF%BC%9A,-Method%201%3A%20Local">complete guide</a> on "how to" get started with the developer preview.</p><p>Xiaomi's post didn't tease any new features, so it's unclear if developers can expect to see anything new before a more public beta for users drops.</p>
<h2 id="an-early-android-16-2">An Early Android 16</h2>

<p>We're nearing the full release of a much earlier Android OS upgrade from Google as Android 16 reached "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-beta-3-launch">Platform Stability</a>." The update in late March marked a major milestone for the next software update as Google progresses with a rapid timeline for the future of Android. Platform Stability means all in-app behaviors have been finalized, and developers are given one last call for final changes to their apps.</p><p>April will hold any last-minute adjustments from Google and developers before it drops in users' hands. Google said, "We’re putting additional energy into working with our device partners to bring the Q2 release to as many devices as possible." Android 16 is expected to launch by the end of June.</p><p>So, it's no surprise that Xiaomi is getting started on a developer preview of its own while it toils away at its HyperOS Android 16-skin.</p><p>Other OEMs have also started working on their Android 16 versions, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-13-users-get-android-16-beta-2">OnePlus and its flagship 13 model</a>. Consumers with that device are getting their first glimpse of Android 16 as the company prepares for a rapid launch.</p>

<ul><li>OnePlus 13 users can now give Android 16 Beta 2 a test run and see what this new OS feels like on their phones.</li><li>The company put out a detailed guide for developers and advanced users who'd like to test out the new software.</li><li>OnePlus does caution users about known issues and the risk of bricking their phones, during this upgrade process.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>OnePlus 13 owners are in for a new experience as the company just announced that it is making Android 16 Beta 2 available to developers and advanced users.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1825773890316533761">detailed community post</a>, the company said that it is giving users early access to the latest Android experience. This is the first time that OnePlus has made a beta version of a new OS available to its users. With this release, it "hope(s) to empower app developers and early adopters in our community to build even better software experiences."</p><p>It should be noted that while this is Android 16 Beta 2 (Pixel phones are currently on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16 Beta 3</a>), this is the first Android 16 beta version available for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>.</p>

<p>But before you get all excited, it is important to know that this upgrade isn't for new or inexperienced users who are unfamiliar with unstable software versions. And it also isn't for folks who use the OnePlus 13 as their primary device for daily tasks.</p><p>As the community post points out, there are notable bugs and issues that users will come across once they've upgraded to the Android 16 Beta 2. Some of them are that the device may restart when answering a call using Bluetooth headsets, users can encounter lag and display issues in the camera viewfinder and thumbnail in certain scenarios, the phone's camera crashes when switching between different camera modes, specifically the Macro mode and Ultra Steady mode.</p><p>That said, there are other issues that you may come across, making the device lag more than usual.</p>

<p>For those who intend to go ahead with the upgrade, the company cautions users that "<em>there is a risk of bricking your phone"</em><strong> </strong>if they do not follow the upgrade manual to the T.  So it is advised that you back up all the important files on your phone before attempting to upgrade the software.</p><p>Other things to keep in mind during this upgrade are that the phone needs to have at least 30% battery and storage space of more than 4GB. Additionally, the current software version must be <em><strong>15.0.0.703 or below</strong></em> to upgrade to Android 16 Beta 2. "If you're on a higher version, you'll need to <strong>downgrade</strong> first," OnePlus added. Lastly, OnePlus 13 phones on T-Mobile and Verizon carriers are not compatible with the Android 16 Beta 2.</p><p>If you're someone who checks all the above boxes and is ready to give the beta a test drive, then be sure to follow this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1825773890316533761">upgrade guide</a> carefully to be one of the first people to experience Android 16 Beta 2 on OnePlus phones.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung's security updates page no longer lists the Galaxy S20 series, meaning its software support has officially come to a close.</li><li>After receiving a "Quarterly" extension in 2024, the S20 flagship trio will no longer be updated; however, the S20 FE can stay a little longer.</li><li>Samsung has shifted to a seven-year support cycle for its phones, but that promise might not embody that sentiment to the core.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>While many people coveted the Galaxy S20 series, April marks the end of it in the eyes of Samsung.</p><p>The end of OS and security update support for the Galaxy S20, S20 Plus, and S20 Ultra was made apparent in an updated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://security.samsungmobile.com/workScope.smsb">Samsung security updates</a> page (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/04/08/galaxy-s20-series-out-of-updates/">9to5Google</a>). The once-flagship trio are no longer listed on the company's Monthly, Quarterly, or Biannual update cadence sections. This comes after the Galaxy S20 series was moved from Monthly to Quarterly a year ago during Samsung's software extension era.</p><p>After downloading the March 2025 security patch, users with these phones will (for sure) no longer see an update from Samsung. The publication highlights the possibility of another security update; however, that will likely only be in the most extreme cases for severe vulnerabilities.</p><p>While the S20 trio exits, Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung/samsung-galaxy-s20-fe-review">Galaxy S20 FE</a> (and its 5G variant) remains. The company's security page lists the device under its Quarterly update section. The FE variant is likely in for two more updates, one in Q2 and another in Q3, before it bids farewell, too.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="nAYPidDdg6gUw4k6UMoksG" name="galaxy-s20-ultra-lock-screen-2.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nAYPidDdg6gUw4k6UMoksG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Martonik / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Galaxy S20 series should've come to a close a year ago; however, Samsung announced it would move the devices <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-galaxy-s20-series-wont-get-any-more-monthly-updates">from Monthly to Quarterly patches</a> in April 2024. After originally launching in 2020, the Korean OEM promised four years of software support for the trio. The phones would receive three major OS upgrades (Android 10 to 13) and four years of security updates.</p><p>With that, 2024 should've been the end — but Samsung saw otherwise for a selection of devices with quite a short support cycle. Aside from the S20 series and its FE model, Samsung extended support for the Galaxy Note 20 and Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, too. Of course, this only concerned security patches, as none of these devices grabbed Android 14.</p><p>It's also worth mentioning that, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-how-many-updates">like the Galaxy S24 series</a>, Samsung has moved toward seven years of software support. The Galaxy S25 also received this treatment; however, there's more to unravel for its predecessors as "seven years of support" <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/7-years-of-updates-arent-what-you-think-they-are-and-samsung-just-proved-it">isn't what most users think</a>. In reality, while the S24 will receive Android 21 (in 2031, potentially), the device will likely have to miss out on major One UI features.</p><p>Samsung EVP and head of Framework R&D, Sally, highlighted the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-ai-hardware-limitations-interview-highlight">major toll its AI takes</a> on a phone's hardware in One UI 7. As such, many of its past-gen phones will not receive the next upgrade's Personal Data Engine, as it's far too reliant on the current hardware provided by the Snapdragon 8 Elite.</p>

What if the AI assistant in your glasses could help you find them because it <em>remembers</em> where you last placed it? Whether this sounds creepy or not, it's certainly a new kind of superpower, and it's being made possible by an upcoming pair of Android XR smart glasses.</p><p>At TED 2025 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.goodgoodgood.co/articles/google-glasses-android-xr-translation">Good Good Good</a>), Google's head of augmented reality and extended reality, Shahram Izadi, debuted a pair of smart glasses that can do just this. We've seen these glasses hinted at before <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-may-have-shown-off-ar-glasses-prototype-at-io-2024">during Google I/O</a>, but this is the first time they were shown off live on stage.</p><p>The glasses are powered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a>, Google's latest branch of Android that promises to make eXtended Reality (XR) — the overarching term that includes Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) — as prolific as Wear OS or Android Auto devices. It's possible these are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-gear/samsung-could-be-working-smart-glasses">Samsung HAEAN</a> smart glasses, but Google representatives didn't give a product name at the presentation.</p>

<p>During the presentation, Google product manager Nishtha Bhatia asked Gemini where she had left her hotel room key card, to which the AI promptly responded, "The hotel key card is to the left of the music record" on the shelf behind her. It's not known how long these glasses will be able to record footage during the day or how far this memory feature can go, but it's a killer app for both AI and smart glasses, to say the least.</p><p>The implications of virtual memory can be extraordinarily far-reaching. I think of my own grandparents who suffered from dementia and couldn't remember simple things throughout the day. Glasses like these would profoundly impact their lives, helping to significantly improve their quality of life had they been around to see this.</p><p>Previously, Google showed off this "superpower" during Google I/O 2024 while running an early version of Project Astra on a phone. You can view the original Project Astra demonstration, including the memory feature at timestamp 1:20 in the video below.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nXVvvRhiGjI?start=80" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Izadi said "These glasses work with your phone, streaming back and forth, allowing the glasses to be very lightweight and access all of your phone apps," meaning the upcoming smart glasses project from Google will almost certainly only feature light onboard processing to ensure battery longevity. Project Astra <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/project-astra-joins-gemini-arm-as-google-gears-up-for-public-launch">is launching publicly soon</a> and will likely continue to run on your phone while a pair of smart glasses film the world around you.</p><p>The glasses shown at TED 2025 included a display in at least one of the lenses, although that particular functionality was only shown off briefly for a live translation demo where words were displayed on the lenses. We learned <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-ar-glasses-problems-behind-scenes">back in August 2023</a> that Google was working on several different pairs of smart glasses, including a pair with a single display and another pair with two displays — one in each lens.</p><p>This all comes as news surrounding next-generation smart glasses has been heating up. Meta is said to be debuting a next-gen Ray-Ban branded pair of smart glasses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-with-display-rumor">with a single display</a> this year, including a wristband <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-semg-wristband-whitepaper">that allows phoneless interaction</a> with what you see on the glasses display.</p>

<p>We haven't heard of Google working on a similar wristband, which means the company will likely rely heavily on Gemini to control most of the interaction. I saw Project Astra firsthand <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-project-starline-astra-ar-glasses">at Google I/O last year</a> and came away impressed with the AI's capabilities to understand spatial relationships and interpret what it sees through a camera.</p><p>Google will be using this exact functionality in their smart glasses when they debut, although it's not known if this particular pair will be part of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/what-to-expect-from-android-xr-in-2025">2025 Android XR lineup</a> or if we'll need to wait for next year to see them hit shelves.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-22">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Samsung’s foldables have been a bit underwhelming lately, but 2025 could finally bring some big upgrades.</li><li>The Z Fold 7 might get an improved under-display camera and a tougher, more durable screen with new materials.</li><li>It might feature a bigger 8-inch main screen and a 6.5-inch cover display, up from the Z Fold 6’s 7.6-inch and 6.3-inch screens.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung’s foldable crowd hasn’t exactly been blown away by the slow drip of upgrades. However, it’s looking like things might finally take a real turn in 2025.</p><p>A new report says that Samsung’s foldables might be in for a major glow-up in 2025. According to @TheGalox_ on X, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> could show up with an upgraded under-display camera and a tougher screen built with some fresh layered materials.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Galaxy Z Fold7 | What's new?• One UI 8 out of the box• Upgraded Under Display Camera• Stronger Display with new layers• Bigger at 8" inside & 6.5" outside • New 200mp main camera • Thinner body at 4.5mm unfolded • Improved water & dust resistance • Smaller crease… pic.twitter.com/1zzVMwDJNE<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1909739032264728931">April 8, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Meanwhile, there’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.blog.naver.com/PostView.naver?blogId=yeux1122&logNo=223826994201&navType=by" target="_blank">buzz</a> that Samsung has been struggling to fine-tune its Under Display Camera tech both in terms of performance and keeping costs in check. So while the Z Fold 7 is still expected to pack a UDC, Samsung is reportedly already eyeing other options for future models.</p>
<h2 id="under-display-camera-last-hurrah-2">Under Display Camera – last hurrah?</h2>
<p>Funny enough, Samsung and Apple might be on the same page for once: both seem to be pumping the brakes on under-display cameras. If the rumors are right, the Galaxy Z Fold 8 and future flagships could ditch UDC entirely.</p><p>@TheGalox_ also backed up a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-flip-7-one-ui-8-preloaded/" target="_blank">recent report</a> claiming both the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7 are set to ship with One UI 8 right out of the box.</p><p>Even though Samsung fans weren’t too thrilled with how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review">One UI 7</a> (Android 15) turned out, there’s a lot more hope riding on the next version of its custom UI.</p><p>Samsung seems to be moving pretty fast with its next software update, and it lines up with Android 16’s expected rollout. Google is aiming to drop the big update around June, after a round of beta testing.</p><p>The tipster also spilled some details about the Galaxy Z Fold 7 getting a size boost. Rumor has it the main foldable screen could stretch to 8 inches, with the cover display hitting 6.5 inches.</p><p>For comparison, the Z Fold 6 sports a 7.6-inch inner screen and a 6.3-inch outer one.</p><p>There's also a good chance the next model could come with an upgraded main camera, possibly hitting 200MP. That’s a major jump from the 50MP sensor in the current version.</p>
<h2 id="performance-and-durability-upgrades-2">Performance and durability upgrades</h2>
<p>Inside, the next foldable is expected to pack the faster Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chip. As for durability, the rumor points to a higher IP rating for better dust and water resistance. For comparison, the current Z Fold 6 has an IP48 rating, so the new model could come with even tougher protection against the elements.</p><p>The new device might have a slimmer design, possibly as thin as 4.5mm when unfolded. There’s also talk of a smoother fold, with less of a noticeable crease on the inside screen.</p><p>On top of that, a bigger vapor chamber is expected, which would help keep things cool during heavy tasks like gaming, improving long-term performance.</p>

<hr>
<p>While we await Samsung's personal robot reveal, the company is highlighting a new partnership to expand its AI capabilities later this summer.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-google-cloud-expand-partnership-bring-gemini-ballie-home-ai-companion-robot-by-samsung/">press release</a>, Samsung announced a new partnership with Google Cloud, which will bring the Gemini model to the personal home companion, Ballie. Samsung's executive vice president of the visual display business, Yongjae Kim, said, "By pairing Gemini’s powerful multimodal reasoning with Samsung’s AI capabilities in Ballie, we’re leveraging the power of open collaboration to unlock a new era of personalized AI companion."</p><p>For consumers, the post says Ballie will leverage Gemini's multimodal software alongside Samsung's language models to "process and understand a variety of inputs." Ballie is said to understand/process audio and the user's voice. Additionally, the AI companion can process visual data from its camera and sensor data from its environment.</p><p>With Gemini and Samsung's software, Ballie's behavior and responses are expected to "adapt in real-time."</p>
<h2 id="ballie-has-your-back-2">Ballie has your back</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PZ7Ro2xyyD6yFS2E5uMgYk" name="samsung-ballie-house-roaming" alt="An image of Samsung's upcoming yellow Ballie AI robot sitting on the floor by a sofa." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PZ7Ro2xyyD6yFS2E5uMgYk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung states this partnership with Google should move Ballie into a personal position, allowing users to seek help for a variety of subjects. The post highlights Ballie's ability to help users with fashion choices in the morning. Samsung gives the following example: "Hey Ballie, how do I look?" The AI robot will reportedly examine you through its camera before offering a set of "styling recommendations," which could include accessories or an entirely new top.</p><p>Elsewhere, Ballie features health and wellness assistance. If a user is tired, Samsung says it can express this to the AI robot. Ballie will then use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini's Search engine abilities</a> to find how best to improve its users' energy levels.</p><p>Samsung confirms Ballie is preparing to launch "this summer" in the U.S. and South Korea. While the post highlights more personal AI assistance, the little yellow ball will also aid in smart home tasks like adjusting your lights, answering the door, setting reminders, and more. Samsung states it's still finalizing product specifications, so more concrete information about Ballie will be made available at a later time.</p><p>Users can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/projectors/home-robot-ballie/?r=true&referrer=usnewsroom">sign up for Ballie updates</a> to stay in the loop.</p><p>Samsung first teased Ballie in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-ces-2020">a promo video five years ago,</a> during CES 2020. We got a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-phone-subscription-club-service-detailed">surprising update about it</a> earlier this year in January from Samsung's vice chairman, Han Jong-hee, who said Ballie is preparing to launch in the U.S. and South Korea. However, Han Jong-hee stated the robot would see a "first half" of 2025 launch, which remains to be seen. If true, then Ballie would have to debut sometime between now and June.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>There used to be a time when every new Android release brought with it considerable UI changes and feature additions. As exciting as that was, it didn't lead to a consistent user experience, so it's understandable that brands have tried to focus on that area in the last three years. Samsung in particular doesn't make many changes to One UI, eschewing constant change for familiarity. <br><br>That's what makes the One UI 7 update that much more notable; this is Samsung's biggest UI overhaul in a while, and it delivers an overall aesthetic that's cleaner, more modern, and with better customizability than ever before. Samsung clearly had issues managing the scale of the changes — most of its flagships still haven't picked up the Android 15-based update — but it is undeniable that One UI 7 heralds a new era of Samsung's software vision. <br><br>I started out with TouchWiz Nature UX 2.0 on the Galaxy S4, and used every subsequent version of Samsung's interface released over the last decade, including all One UI iterations. Here's what I think of One UI 7, and why I believe it is a pivotal update for Samsung's devices.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-one-ui-7-gets-a-much-needed-ui-overhaul"><span>One UI 7 gets a much-needed UI overhaul</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="UwMjVfTLSekVMKi5UTRGS6" name="Samsung One UI 7" alt="Samsung One UI 7 interface on Galaxy A56" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UwMjVfTLSekVMKi5UTRGS6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung overhauled the interface with One UI 7, and it is a positive move overall. The interface now looks cleaner and has better colors throughout, and it is cohesive. Samsung tweaked the design of the icons as well, and they have better gradation and look a little more elegant. There's better customizability in this area as well, with One UI 7 allowing you to change the size of icons and disable text labels (finally).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="S8y95DFkNxAKAQWLSiL2Y6" name="Samsung One UI 7" alt="Samsung One UI 7 interface on Galaxy A56" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/S8y95DFkNxAKAQWLSiL2Y6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Widgets are cleaner too, and the changes to the design make using One UI 7 that much more enjoyable. That said, Samsung maintained the right balance; while the UI looks modern, it's still immediately familiar. Samsung didn't make wholesale changes to how you  interact with the interface, instead updating elements that started showing their age.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vQocE8cZrRGBY5dEnE2qY6" name="Samsung One UI 7" alt="Samsung One UI 7 interface on Galaxy A56" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vQocE8cZrRGBY5dEnE2qY6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Some of the design tweaks are motivated by iOS, and there's no getting around that — most Android brands are guilty of doing this. Having said that, the implementation is quite different to what you get on an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>, and Samsung did a good job "borrowing" some of these utilities and integrating them into its own interface.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PBuK2kmYnx8tuK7Wn8EkK6" name="Samsung One UI 7" alt="Samsung One UI 7 interface on Galaxy A56" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PBuK2kmYnx8tuK7Wn8EkK6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A smaller update has to do with the battery; the icon in the status bar has a cleaner pill-sized design, but what I like the most is that it houses the percentage within the icon. This was a bugbear on One UI 6.1.1 as the percentage sat outside the icon, so it's good to see Samsung making this move.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vgD7GKCtitfmccLASo3ZX6" name="Samsung One UI 7" alt="Samsung One UI 7 interface on Galaxy A56" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vgD7GKCtitfmccLASo3ZX6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another small tweak has to do with enlarged folders. This is something that ColorOS and MagicOS do really well, and Samsung is now aiming to follow suit. With bigger folders, you don't need to go into a folder to launch an app that's located inside, and it is highly convenient.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="43e7yMFvxHxZY2QZdL2GX6" name="Samsung One UI 7" alt="Samsung One UI 7 interface on Galaxy A56" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/43e7yMFvxHxZY2QZdL2GX6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's a new Game Booster that lets you tweak settings in individual titles to maximize efficiency or performance, and it makes a difference. Galaxy AI continues to be a differentiator, and Samsung is building out a decent set of utilities in this area.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="cgiErQzYCdKBPFMeCw7XX6" name="Samsung One UI 7" alt="Samsung One UI 7 interface on Galaxy A56" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cgiErQzYCdKBPFMeCw7XX6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The UI has better optimization, and that in turns means you get better fluidity even on mid-range devices like the Galaxy A56, where this has been a constant problem with previous iterations. That said, it doesn't quite have the same level of fluidity as ColorOS on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a> or even Xiaomi's latest software running on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-ultra-review">Xiaomi 15 Ultra</a>, but it is a decent change in the context of Samsung phones.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-one-ui-7-has-a-split-notification-pane"><span>One UI 7 has a split notification pane</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="RyjtVvD8GaKPQdHvbRoWT6" name="Samsung One UI 7" alt="Samsung One UI 7 interface on Galaxy A56" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RyjtVvD8GaKPQdHvbRoWT6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The biggest difference in One UI 7 has to do with the notification pane; Samsung now uses a split shade with the toggles sitting on one side, and the notifications on the other. This is similar to iOS' Control Center, and most Chinese brands are also using a similar system. The pane isn't fully opaque, and it does a good job highlighting the background colors.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ZehJq5GU2mToGa2htS8iT6" name="Samsung One UI 7" alt="Samsung One UI 7 interface on Galaxy A56" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZehJq5GU2mToGa2htS8iT6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Thankfully, you can switch back to a unified pane if that's what you prefer. While that's what I usually do on most Android phones, I found myself liking the split pane quite a bit; you get a greater number of controls in the toggles section, and a pull-down gesture anywhere on the screen surfaces the notification shade — to get to the toggles, you'll need to pull down from the top right corner.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PsbrZGWp8h36efwhhm6VX6" name="Samsung One UI 7" alt="Samsung One UI 7 interface on Galaxy A56" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PsbrZGWp8h36efwhhm6VX6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The split pane shows volume control in addition to the standard brightness slider, and you get the usual smart home device controls and Modes (what Routines is now dubbed). You can switch between notifications and toggles by swiping right and left, and Samsung did all the right things in this regard.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-actually-added-a-vertically-scrolling-app-drawer"><span>Samsung actually added a vertically-scrolling app drawer</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="L8Ao2eEm4nNu7kfcU5EzN6" name="Samsung One UI 7" alt="Samsung One UI 7 interface on Galaxy A56" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/L8Ao2eEm4nNu7kfcU5EzN6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What I like the most about One UI 7 is the introduction of a vertically-scrolling app drawer. Samsung was the only holdout to still use a horizontal app drawer, and it was constantly frustrating whenever I used one of its phones. I had to use Good Lock to switch to a vertically-scrolling drawer, and that was usually one of the first things I changed on Samsung's devices.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="2H7fp6DmjohkCg5HUdAoY6" name="Samsung One UI 7" alt="Samsung One UI 7 interface on Galaxy A56" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2H7fp6DmjohkCg5HUdAoY6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With One UI 7 though, you don't need to go that route; the drawer scrolls vertically as standard, and it is a minor change that makes a big difference in usability — particularly if you're like me and have plenty of apps installed. Another positive change is the positioning of the search bar within the drawer; it is now located at the bottom, and that makes it easier to pull up.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-now-bar-provides-contextual-info-in-one-ui-7"><span>Now Bar provides contextual info in One UI 7</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PuXshukwQzpSUFBdhaT2a6" name="Samsung One UI 7" alt="Samsung One UI 7 interface on Galaxy A56" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PuXshukwQzpSUFBdhaT2a6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Just like every other manufacturer, Samsung is emulating iOS' Dynamic Island, but because the Korean brand has to be different, its implementation is unlike that of any other device. The feature is dubbed Now Bar, and is basically shows things like media controls, timer, recorder, navigation, and other ongoing actions in a pill-sized box that sits at the bottom of the lock screen.</p>
<p>The idea is that you can interact with these actions without having to wake the screen, and I used it to good effect to control music playback in YouTube Music. Samsung has a secondary option called Live Notifications that sit in the status bar, and they do a similar thing — you can control music playback and other actions by selecting the icon.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="nSi9J5EderDC8UUvbERKG6" name="Samsung One UI 7" alt="Samsung One UI 7 interface on Galaxy A56" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nSi9J5EderDC8UUvbERKG6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unlike most devices, these notifications aren't centered around the camera cutout, but sit to a side in the status bar. ColorOS does a better job handling these notifications, and Samsung needs to tweak the design a little bit in this area.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-overview-menu-is-much-better-in-one-ui-7"><span>The Overview menu is much better in One UI 7</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="jDfiPkx4rzrYxPEYAKq9Q6" name="Samsung One UI 7" alt="Samsung One UI 7 interface on Galaxy A56" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jDfiPkx4rzrYxPEYAKq9Q6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung also changed the overview menu, and it has much better usability. Instead of one card dominating the view, you get a rolodex-like design that lets you preview cards in the background, and it is a much-needed change. The scrolling action when going through the recents menu is smoother as well.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Samsung hasn't changed the option to launch split-screen mode via the Overview menu. You can still press on an app icon and choose to go into split-screen mode effortlessly, and this is another small area where One UI has an advantage over its Android rivals.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-one-ui-7-gets-a-brand-new-camera-interface"><span>One UI 7 gets a brand-new camera interface</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vsstohWf2ccfqGsDMnTo56" name="Samsung One UI 7" alt="Samsung One UI 7 interface on Galaxy A56" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vsstohWf2ccfqGsDMnTo56.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Along with the rest of the interface, Samsung cleaned up the camera UI, and it is much better organized. The shooting modes have been moved to the bottom of the viewfinder, and it's easier to switch between modes with your thumb. Most of the toggles and filters are hidden behind a settings button, and this ensures the interface isn't anywhere as cluttered.</p>
<p>Alongside better controls, you get good editing tools, and like every other brand, Samsung is leveraging AI to be the differentiator.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-better-battery-controls-higher-drain"><span>Better battery controls, higher drain</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="YryCTAUTmQMYWbTXM9oHZ6" name="Samsung One UI 7" alt="Samsung One UI 7 interface on Galaxy A56" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YryCTAUTmQMYWbTXM9oHZ6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I used the One UI 7 beta builds in the past, and there was a noticeable decrease in battery life over One UI 6.1.1 on the S24+. This is still the case when I used the stable One UI 7 build on the Galaxy A56; the phone didn't last quite as long as its immediate rivals with equivalent batteries, so it's clear that Samsung needs to do additional tweaks to deliver better battery efficiency.</p>
<p>Samsung lags behind every other Android brand when it comes to battery tech, both in terms of charging and willingness to switch to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/most-android-flagships-are-getting-an-exciting-battery-upgrade-in-2025">silicon-carbide tech</a> to deliver better density. But what I like is that battery protections are better in One UI 7; you can now set a charging limit and customize it between 80% to 95%, giving you much greater flexibility.</p>

<p>Samsung is usually good with updates, but that just hasn't been the case with One UI 7. As of April 9, my Galaxy S24+ still hasn't picked up the stable One UI 7 build, and it is the only 2024 flagship to not make the switch to Android 15. Samsung clearly had challenges in getting the Android 15 build out the door, and it will only take longer for the brand's budget and mid-range devices to switch to the latest version of Android.</p>
<p>With Google accelerating the Android 16 launch, Samsung's delay means most of its devices will pick up Android 15 just as the next version of Android becomes available.</p>

<p>The definition of a good update is when a brand introduces meaningful additions while still retaining the core feature-set, and Samsung did a great job nailing that balance with One UI 7. The changes to the design bring a level of vibrancy and dynamism to the interface, and it has better fluidity on mid-range devices. <br><br>The fundamentals are unchanged, so if you're used to call recording in the dialer, Samsung Internet, Samsung Messages, and the brand's unique customization options, those are still just as good as previous iterations of the interface. Ultimately, the only problem with One UI 7 is just how long it is taking to show up on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">best Samsung phones</a>. But having used it for a while now, I can say that it is worth the wait.</p>

<ul><li>Google is adding a new version of Gemini to Android Studio that's specifically designed for businesses.</li><li>The exclusive tier prevents Google from saving company code, which won't be used for AI model training.</li><li>Google will also protect companies from IP claims against code created with the help of Gemini in Android Studio.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is introducing a new version of Gemini in Android Studio tailored for businesses that need AI coding help, it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/04/gemini-in-android-studio-for-business.html" target="_blank">announced</a> today. The upgraded offering, available with Gemini Code Assist Standard or Enterprise subscriptions, adds security and intellectual property (IP) protections to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> features already available.</p><p>The feature set includes many Gemini in Android Studio staples, like build and sync error support, Gemini-powered App Quality Insights, and Compose Preview Generation. On a larger scale, Gemini in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/reported-changes-to-android-development-arent-really-a-change">Android Studio</a> is supposed to help app developers work through the process of creating and maintaining an Android app. This version in particular is intended to address some of the concerns business owners and enterprises might have using AI to help with their apps.</p><p>These tools can be customized to match a company's internal codebase by linking to GitHub, GitLab or BitBucket repositories.</p><p>Notably, unlike other Gemini offerings, no code created with Gemini in Android Studio for businesses is stored with Google. Additionally, code isn't used to train new AI models. Using the Private Google Access, VPC Service Controls, and Enterprise Access Controls security features, businesses can completely control how their code is used and safeguarded.</p>

<p>Corporate IT departments may be pleased to learn that Gemini in Android Studio for businesses meets the following industry <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-saif-risk-assessment-security-threats-details">security certifications</a>:</p>
<ul><li>SOC 1/2/3, ISO/IEC 27001 (Information Security Management)</li><li>27017 (Cloud Security)</li><li>27018 (Protection of PII)</li><li>27701 (Privacy Information Management)</li></ul>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, Google is providing companies with peace-of-mind with IP indemnification.</p><p>"Organizations will benefit from generative AI IP indemnification, safeguarding their organizations against third parties claiming copyright infringement related to the AI-generated code," Google explains. "This added layer of protection is the same indemnification policy we provide to Google Cloud customers using our generative AI APIs, and allows their developers to leverage the power of AI with greater confidence and reduced risk."</p><p>Companies interested in trying out this enterprise-grade version of Gemini in Android Studio can download the Android Studio Narwhal build from the Canary release channel. They'll also need an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-adds-free-gemini-code-assist-tier-with-180-000-monthly-code-completions">active, eligible Gemini Code Assist license</a>.</p>

Unlike dumbphones, modern minimal phones such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-light-phone-3-is-here-with-miniature-features-massive-usd799-price-tag">Light Phone 3</a> and Minimal Phone come with Android and support a wide variety of the latest mobile apps.</p><p>So, what keeps them minimal? None of these minimalist devices have colored displays, making them non-intrusive and less distracting. They also have a limited OS and functionality, but not to the extent of dumbphones. Some of them don't even use a touch screen, like the Light Phone 3 or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.punkt.ch/en/products/mp02-4g-mobile-phone/">Punkt MP02</a>, favoring old-school keypads for input instead.</p><p>I find that this new-school variety of minimal phones is more appropriate for the current world as opposed to a dumbphone like the Nokia 2780.</p>

<p>Why would anyone want a "less smart" phone, you ask? We're always distracted by our smartphones these days, and issues like doom-scrolling seriously kill motivation and focus. There is a small niche of people who don't want to be immersed in social media and be connected all the time, everywhere they go.</p><p>There are also other niches of older, more senior individuals who find modern flagships to be too complex, as well as kids who are much too young to have a full-fledged Android or iOS smartphone. Many people also like to have a secondary basic phone for times when they need to take a break from the internet and social media.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-dumb-phone">Dumbphones</a> are just nice for these groups of people, but they are extremely limited in their capabilities as they don't come with Android. While this is by design, the modern world demands a more balanced approach for such users.</p>
<h2 id="minimalist-phones-offer-a-more-balanced-approach-2">Minimalist phones offer a more balanced approach</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4351px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="MC6mD7F22YUeAT2rj5jLa9" name="minimal-phone-lifestyle-2" alt="Minimal Phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MC6mD7F22YUeAT2rj5jLa9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4351" height="2447" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Minimal)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Take the Minimal Phone, for example. It started out as a concept device based on E Ink devices and Blackberry phones. After <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/minimal-phone-concept">passing the design phase in January 2024</a>, the Minimal Phone finally started shipping on April 3, 2025 and can be purchased for $399.99. It's affordable, comes with Android 14, and has all the most desirable functions, such as a mic, speakers, a headphone jack, USB-C charging, GPS, and connectivity via Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, NFC, and cellular.</p><p>The Minimal Phone even has a camera, and you can install apps like WhatsApp, Uber, and Venmo on it. But it's nowhere near as interactive or distracting as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> because the B&W display lacks color and has no touchscreen. Since it uses an E Ink display, it has amazing battery life, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-e-ink-tablet">best e-readers and e-paper tablets</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NopNgUTd3FtGP9etuqavbG" name="Punkt-MP02-lifestyle" alt="Punkt.

<p>In fact, minimalist phones don't even sacrifice durability. The Punkt MP02 sports a regular TFT display, albeit still devoid of color, and what's more impressive is that it has an IP52 splash and dust-resistant rating.</p>
<h2 id="you-can-have-connectivity-but-still-disconnect-2">You can have connectivity but still disconnect</h2>
<p>Minimalist phones are all about intentional connectivity and balance. They offer peace of mind and the option to be on the grid — when you choose to do so. Unlike dumbphones, you can access a vast range of apps and tools, so you're not cut off entirely.</p><p>Despite the added functionality, minimalist phones still manage to disconnect from the fast pace of life. You don't get bombarded with information all the time, and you only log on to social media and the internet on your terms.</p><p>The muted monochrome screen brings solace to the chaos and busyness of feature-rich smartphones with all the bells and whistles imaginable. You're not tempted to constantly watch reels or TikTok videos. It's also very kind to your eyes, contributing to a more comfortable and relaxed user experience.</p><p>I truly believe that this is the right formula for a non-intrusive, uncomplex phone in 2025 as opposed to a dumbphone. It's a great way to slow down and take a breather without handicapping yourself from crucial tools important for everyday life.</p>

Sometimes, you'll get a great new feature that becomes an indispensable part of your everyday life. Other times, your favorite feature might get removed, never to see the light of day until 10 years later when something old becomes new again.</p><p>Case in point is widgets, a major feature of Android 1.0 that saw a significant decline in popularity after Google got rid of lock screen widgets in Android 5. But, as expected, what's old is new again. With the release of Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a>, lock screen widgets are becoming cool again. So much so, in fact, that Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/04/widgets-take-center-stage-with-samsung-oneui7.html">latest Android Developers blog post</a> focuses on how important widgets are for user engagement. Imagine that.</p><p>We first saw the groundwork being laid for lock screen widgets in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-lock-screen-widgets-spotted">beta build of Android 14</a>, followed by a full rollout of the feature on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Google Pixel Tablet</a> last September. More phones <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-is-bringing-widgets-to-phone-lock-screens-with-android-16-qpr1">will be getting the feature</a> with a quarterly update of Android 16, but Samsung is beating everyone else to the punch by including it on every device that has access to One UI 7 this year.</p>

<p>Google's renewed interest in widgets really started to pop on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a> last year when it launched a redesigned Pixel Weather app, which prominently featured widgets of all kinds. These widgets weren't just gorgeous looking; they also made it easy to see and understand a plethora of data at a glance.</p><p>While you can't break these widgets out of the app and place them individually on your home screen or lock screen (classic Google), many other apps are starting to take widgets more seriously, and Google Play is adapting. Developers can now show their app widgets right on the Play Store listing, and users can search specifically for apps that include widgets by using a handy filter.</p><p>I use widgets every single day to quickly take notes or access individual notes, control media playback with a dedicated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music">YouTube Music</a> widget, search Google with text or visually with the Google widget, check my weekly meal plan with Our Groceries, quickly start by Roborock robot vacuum routines with a tap, and scroll through my calendar without having to find the app first.</p>

<p>But what I'm really interested in now is relearning how to use lock screen widgets again. These died in the Android 5 days when biometrics were becoming more commonplace as people stopped using their lock screens in favor of unlocking straight to the home screen. Things have changed, though, and we've learned to like our lock screens again.</p><p>Having separate widgets on the lock screen gives us one more surface to custom-tailor our day, and I know exactly what's going to be on there. That dedicated YouTube Music widget will always be on the lock screen, so I don't have to wonder if the OS is smart enough to know what I want.</p><p>A dedicated flashlight button alongside a handful of smart home toggles will await a single press from my thumb for activation, and a quick glance at the Strava health data from my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-review">OnePlus Watch 3</a> will keep me motivated to get moving. Oh, and don't forget the quick voice memo button in Google Keep that makes it handy to take a note at any time.</p><p>Meanwhile, my home screen will be reserved for more sensitive data like actual, scrollable notes, a quick glance at the latest emails and messages that just came in, as well as a little photo frame filled with my favorite memories. Widgets are wonderful, and I'm beyond delighted to see Google start caring about them again, especially in a day in age when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/good-lock-one-ui-7-update-is-great">Good Lock</a> makes it easy to fully customize the living crap out of my home and lock screens!</p>

<hr>
<p>Google Messages is rolling out a built-in “Unsubscribe” button to give you an easy way to shut down those automated texts for good.</p><p>Mishaal Rahman over at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-messages-unsubscribe-button-3542411/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> has spotted a fresh new feature popping up in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-first-things-to-do">Google Messages</a>. It's a little prompt at the end of spammy texts that says, “unsubscribe to stop receiving messages.” Once you tap it, you’ll get a quick pop-up asking why you’re opting out.</p><p>Google Messages has been on top of spam control for a while now. When a shady-looking text comes in, the app drops a little option letting you block the sender or report them on the spot. Tap it, and you’ll get a quick popup asking if you want to include a report before making it final.</p><p>The updated interface introduces a straightforward "Unsubscribe" button. When you tap it, a quick explanation pops up, letting you know it'll send a "Stop" message to the sender, telling them to back off.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:52.20%;"><img id="NY54MzNproMrgohLPq7FeL" name="Google-Messages-new-unsubscribe-option" alt="Google Messages' new unsubscribe option to stop spam texts" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NY54MzNproMrgohLPq7FeL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="522" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When you do get the option, you’ll be asked to pick from five reasons for opting out: “not signed up,” “too many messages,” “no longer interested,” “spam,” or “other. It gives you a bit more control over why you’re saying goodbye to those texts.</p>
<h2 id="oops-changed-your-mind-2">Oops, changed your mind?</h2>
<p>Once you’ve unsubscribed, you’ll see a “unsubscribe request sent” notice right under the “Stop” message. Furthermore, a “Start” button will pop up in the bottom-right corner, giving you the option to resubscribe to those automated texts if you change your mind later.</p><p>Google also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developers.google.com/business-communications/rcs-business-messaging/guides/release-notes#march_25_2025" target="_blank">confirmed</a> that this feature is also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-will-help-you-thwart-ads-and-spam-in-a-future-update">rolling out for RCS Business Messages</a>, and it's already being tested with users in the Google Messages beta program. At the moment, it’s focused on a few regions, including the U.S., UK, Brazil, France, Germany, India, Mexico, and Spain.</p><p>It’s pretty surprising that a feature this simple has taken so long to roll out. But if you haven’t seen it yet, don’t worry since it’s still being rolled out.</p>

<ul><li>A new leak revealed the alleged prices of Google's next flagship lineup.</li><li>It claims that the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL will see a $100 price hike this time around, while the Pixel 10 Pro Fold may drop to $1,600.</li><li>The Pixel line (standard Pixel, two Pro models, and one foldable) will allegedly remain the same until 2028.</li><li>The Google Pixel A-series will also be sold at the same price, $499 through 2028.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google Pixel 10 series rumors have been popping up a lot lately, with<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-alleged-porcelain-renderings-leaked"> official renders </a>and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-series-render-leak-reveal-identical-design">specs</a> leaking way ahead of time. But the latest leak comes from “sources familiar with Google’s plans," both for the Pixel 10 model and the phones to come in the future.</p><p>A lengthy<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/author/alexander-maxham"> report </a>by Android Headlines claims that some models' pricing will change every year for the Google Pixel flagship series, while the others will stay at the same price point, at least until 2028.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1410px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="UDmQwNgra4KCpxoDJ4CWEk" name="google-pixel-10-pro-fold-leaked-render-front-back" alt="A leaked look at the Pixel 10 Pro Fold rendering, showcasing its full internal display and rear panel." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UDmQwNgra4KCpxoDJ4CWEk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1410" height="793" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To start, the publication claims that the next flagship model, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10 series</a>, will see some price changes. While the standard and smaller Pro models will hold the same prices from the previous year, it looks like the Pixel Pro XL will see a $ $100 price bump. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold will allegedly get a $200 reduction in its price, bringing its price tag to $1600, which is in line with a previous rumor we spotted earlier this month.</p><p>Next up is the A-series, or Google's budget devices. Android Headlines claims that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-10a">Pixel 10a</a> will be sold at the same $499 price point as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-hands-on">Pixel 9a</a>. Furthermore, the company will reportedly stick to the same price until 2028 with the Pixel 12a.</p><p>Ultimately, it looks like Google has no plans to switch up its lineup any time soon, even though we feel future Pixel A and base Pixel models should be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-shouldve-merged-the-pixel-9-and-9a">merged into one phone</a>, bringing a device somewhere in the middle with the best of both worlds.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9FLdumVShuzvyLrfbXuMHm" name="Google-pixel-9a-pixel-9-3" alt="The Pixel 9a and Pixel 9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9FLdumVShuzvyLrfbXuMHm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Thus, as for Google's flagship phone plans for the future, the report states that Google will stick to releasing a base model, two Pro phones, a foldable, and a budget device every single year up until 2028.</p><p>This contradicts some rumors that the tech giant would let go of the smaller Pro model sometime in the future. However, according to Android Headlines, this won't happen at least for the next three years.</p><p>Lastly, sources privy to Google's plans told the publication that as the years go by, Google's foldables will also start getting cheaper. “The Pixel Fold model will actually drop in price by the time we get to 2028," Android Headlines stated. It further goes to say that the 2027 Pixel Pro Fold model will see a lower price point of $1500, as the news site assumes Google could be using less expensive hardware for these phones.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1juga19/comment/mm235rh">Comment</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel">r/GooglePixel</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>However, these are still leaks and are subject to a lot of changes in the future. Considering U.S. tariffs are at play even when it comes to electronics, it is hard to say how many of these claims are actually true.</p><p>In a separate Reddit post, someone  from Android Headlines said that they've seen the pricing for Pixel 10, 11, 12, and 13 series, but “it’s all subject to change” and that “everything is a rumor until the company announces it lol.”</p>

<hr>
<p>Google is now rolling out Loss of Pulse Detection, a new safety feature for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a>, to U.S. users. The feature was originally marketed as a Pixel Watch 3 feature last year, and became available in other regions, but required FDA approval before it could work in the U.S.</p><p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-3-gets-fda-approval-for-loss-of-pulse-detection-in-us">earned that approval in February 2025</a>, and Loss of Pulse Detection will become available in the country starting today, with a full rollout lasting a few weeks.</p><p>After earning FDA approval, the company announced Loss of Pulse Detection for U.S. users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixels-march-2025-feature-drop">as part of the March Pixel Feature Drop</a>. Originally, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/feed/pixel-watch-3-loss-of-pulse-detection-fda/" target="_blank">said</a> it would "begin rolling it out in the U.S. at the end of March." That deadline passed, but now the feature is shipping as of April 8, 2025.</p><p>Loss of Pulse Detection is a critical safety feature that Google explains can "detect when you’ve experienced a loss of pulse" and "automatically prompt a call to emergency services for potentially life-saving care if you’re unresponsive." It adds a new element to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-extra-step-for-emergency-sos-on-the-pixel-watch-is-now-available">Emergency SOS</a>, which can be used to call emergency services quickly from your smartwatch.</p>

<p>Loss of Pulse Detection is opt-in, so you'll need to manually enable it when the feature becomes available on your device. To do so, open the <strong>Google Pixel Watch app</strong> on your phone and tap <strong>Safety and Emergency</strong>. Then, press <strong>Loss of Pulse Detection</strong>, and follow the on-screen prompts to enable the safety tool. After that, the feature will monitor your heart rate and try to detect when and if your pulse can't be found.</p><p>Prior to launching in the U.S., Loss of Pulse Detection has been available in 14 countries. The feature first arrived on Pixel Watch 3 for users in the EU last year.</p><p>It's rolling out starting today, but may take "a couple" of weeks before it arrives on all U.S. Pixel Watch 3 devices. The announcement comes as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/wear-os/google-rolls-out-april-2025-update-for-pixel-watch-models">Google releases the April 2025 update</a> for all Pixel Watch models.</p>

<p>Ever since Unpacked in January, we've been expecting the Galaxy Edge S25, and a new leak has surfaced about its launch.</p><p>Samsung's Galaxy S25 Edge might see a slightly staggered launch, at least according to rumors from Ice Universe on Weibo (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MaxJmb/status/1909549515906179551">Max Jambor</a>). Jambor posted a screenshot of the tipster's post, which claims the slim Galaxy S25 Edge will launch in "late May."</p><p>More importantly, Ice Universe purports the first countries to see the device will be "South Korea and China."</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">According to Ice Universe, the Galaxy S25 Edge will be available for sale in late May.

<p>Curiously, this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-delays-galaxy-s25-edge-release-from-april-to-may-or-june-2025">isn't the first time</a> we've heard rumors of the Galaxy S25 Edge's supposed launch date. Originally, there was speculation that the phone would debut in April; however, rumors quickly refuted that, stating Samsung may seek a May or June release. The report earlier this month stated the company had reportedly provided such launch details to telecom providers in South Korea to prepare them.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/looks-like-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-could-launch-in-two-weeks">listing in the Netherlands</a> showed the S25 Edge would've launched on April 15, but the strange delay has seemingly cropped up without much insight into why. With current rumors alleging a late May," perhaps a June launch is more likely for consumers in other regions, like the U.S.</p><p>Additional rumors state the phone measures ~5.8mm in thickness with a 6.7-inch display. While unconfirmed, there's strong speculation that Samsung could provide the Snapdragon 8 Elite inside the S25 Edge like its flagship trio. Elsewhere, rumors may have given us an idea about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung/the-galaxy-s25-edge-might-surprise-with-higher-prices-for-certain-models">phone's pricing range</a> for its models. It seems consumers should brace for 12GB of RAM paired with 256GB or 512GB of storage.</p><p>However, the prices could vary for each. A report states the 256GB option could debut between €1,200–€1,300 ($1,300–$1,400). This could jump slightly for the 512GB as it could receive a €1,300–€1,400 ($1,400–$1,520) starting price. Users may also have a choice between Titanium Icy Blue, Titanium Jet Black, and Titanium Silver for colors.</p>

<ul><li>Google is going after businesses that try to cheat the system with fake five-star reviews.</li><li>In its recent report, Google said it has trained Gemini to detect businesses that try to cheat the system by buying fake five-star reviews.</li><li>Additionally, it is issuing warnings to repeat offenders within the Google Maps app while temporarily disabling reviews for some.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google seems to be going after businesses and establishments that have fake five-star reviews with the help of Gemini.</p><p>In a recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/maps/google-business-profiles-ai-fake-reviews/#:~:text=Our%20progress%20in%202024,that%20repeatedly%20violated%20our%20policies.">Keyword</a> blog, Google explained how AI was able to track down over 10,000 listings managed by a group of "bad actors who impersonated real locksmiths to take over unclaimed Business Profiles and overcharge unsuspecting customers."</p><p>People rely on Google Maps for all sorts of information, from helping with navigation to looking up the best businesses in their area. When you look up a new restaurant you'd want to explore, you'd first check its reviews to see how it compares to the rest and trust that these reviews have been penned down by genuine people who've visited the place.</p><p>This is why Google has been after businesses trying to trick customers into visiting their locations with fake five-star reviews from people who have not been to the establishments.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="d8zfTTjiAXzmvpsXrYWzFh" name="Google-Maps-Fake-reviews-alert" alt="Alerts on Google Maps disabling reviews for a business" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/d8zfTTjiAXzmvpsXrYWzFh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It even seems to have trained a specific Gemini model that will also detect businesses that suddenly change their category. For instance if a cafe turned into a plumbing service, Gemini will identify it as a potentially suspicious profile.</p><p>"This new model has already helped us block thousands of suspicious Business Profile edits this year," the company said in the post.</p><p>Additionally, Gemini is now able to detect fake reviews on establishments several months after the user posted the original review. The tech giant stated that Gemini can "now revisit reviews more frequently to identify new abuse patterns. "</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ERpQEgeCnpxkoeG283bSR6" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Fold-4-google-maps-03.jpg" alt="Viewing Google Maps on the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4's smaller cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ERpQEgeCnpxkoeG283bSR6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, on the business front, the company is issuing alerts to business profiles in the U.S., U.K., and India when fake engagements or reviews are detected. This will be in the form of a banner alert within the app that states, "Google recently removed suspicious five-star reviews" from their profiles.</p><p>Lastly, if certain users are repeat offenders of fake engagement, Google says it will either temporarily disable their ability to post reviews or temporarily hide reviews for that establishment.</p><p>Google stated that in 2024, Gemini detected over 240 million policy-violating reviews, 70 million edits to places on Maps, and 12 million fake Business Profiles. These profiles were either blocked or removed, and posting restrictions were placed on over 900,000 accounts for repeated policy violations.</p>

<p>Easily one of the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">best foldable phones</a> on the market today, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 is a versatile device with a powerful Snapdragon chipset, pocketable form factor, and seven-year software promise. Buy the phone at Samsung today and you'll be eligible for up to $750 of trade-in credit or $150 off if you select No Trade-in. You'll also get access to a few exclusive color variants that you can't find anywhere else!<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-z-flip6/buy/galaxy-z-flip6-256gb-unlocked-sm-f741uakaxaa/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="f62fb152-f14e-49d8-be7f-83a9fa7c0feb" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 256GB: $1,099.99" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 256GB: $1,099.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>While we wait for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> to arrive later this year, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 is one of the best clamshell-style phones that money can buy, coming complete with a custom Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor, two vibrant AMOLED displays, and all of the latest Gemini and Galaxy AI software features. You&apos;ll also get seven years of OS/security updates guaranteed, and as we note in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">our 4/5-star review</a>, a nearly-invisible display crease. </p><p>If you&apos;re interested in going the trade-in route with this deal, it&apos;s worth noting that Samsung is being pretty generous with the old or broken phones that it accepts. The Galaxy Z Flip 5 and Z Fold 5 will get you the max $750 off, while older phones dating back to the Galaxy S22 Ultra will land you a stellar $500 discount. Buying from Samsung also gets you a few free entertainment services, such as six months of SiriusXM, three months of Peacock Premium, and more. </p><p>Again, if you prefer using the latest and greatest technology, I&apos;d probably wait to see what preorder deals are announced when the Galaxy Z Flip 7 is revealed (presumably in July or August). But if you simply want an awesome flip phone ASAP, this Samsung deal presents a unique opportunity. </p>

<ul><li>The Onyx Boox Page is receiving a version 4.0 update that refines the screen-touching experience for readers.</li><li>Boox rolls in a host of Library and NeoReader updates, too, that add customization to the Library View" and "List" settings.</li><li>The update is rolling out with a 338MB download size.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Boox is rolling out an update for its 2024 e-reader that packs bug fixes as well as new updates to improve its reading experience.</p><p>The update for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/onyx-boox-page-review">Onyx Boox Page</a> was spotted by Android Central's Nicholas Sutrich this morning (Apr. 8), marked as v4.0. Users looking to update should begin noticing it today; however, it arrives as a 338MB download. Boox provided its entire changelog, which begins with a few System updates. The company is improving the system UI interfaces and the operation feedback prompts.</p><p>For the latter, Boox says this should make screen-touching "more intuitive and accurate." Additionally, users will find the option to enable and disable "full refresh" when returning to the home screen. Boox states users can find it by heading into <strong>Settings > Display > Full Refresh When Back to Home Screen</strong>.</p><p>The Library and NeoReader pick up a few updates, too. The patch notes detail the ability to now "customize the top function bar of the Library." Users can re-order its provided function <strong>Library Settings > Library List Settings</strong>. "Library View" gains an easy switch button in the lower right-hand corner of the library. Additionally, Boox has added customizable Reading Themes, letting users change the font, margin, spacing, and background color.</p><p>A more "intuitive" reading progress bar arrives in the version 4.0 update alongside support for "independent settings" regarding titles, body text fonts, and supplementary fonts of reflowable documents.</p>
<h2 id="additional-boox-page-updates-2">Additional Boox Page Updates</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="kQGvK4tHVLdfJMuauuTxqa" name="onyx-boox-page-version-4-patch-notes-start" alt="A photo of the changelog for version 4.0 for the Boox Page e-reader." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kQGvK4tHVLdfJMuauuTxqa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<ul><li>Optimized OCR function, OCR now works in the background while you read PDFs</li><li>Optimized word lookup experience, you can prioritize Word Lookup or Translation (Selection) in Neoreader > Settings > Dictionary Settings</li><li>Optimized display of Traditional/Japanese symbols</li><li>Adjusted the Refresh entry of Neoreader to the first-level bottom menu for easier refresh mode customization</li><li>Fixed some known issues and improved system stability</li></ul>
<p>The update has started rolling out, so users should be aware and check their device accordingly. Boox warns that the Page e-reader will go through a brief optimization period after the patch. This may lead to increased heat and power consumption; however those issues should subside after a couple of days.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/onyx-boox-page-review">Boox Page</a> is a pretty decent e-reader with a 7-inch E Ink display. Users are confined to its black and white screen, which makes doing anything else (watching videos or a light game) a little hard to deal with. The reading experience is made quite easy as the Page features dual page-turning buttons on the front. There's also the larger <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/onyx-boox-note-air-3-review">Boox Note Air 3</a> with a 10.3-inch display that takes reading files, emails, and books to another level.</p>

<p>So what do Samsung phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> have? <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-good-lock">Samsung Good Lock</a>. No, that's not me misspelling "good luck, Samsung." That's the name for Samsung's epic software and UI customization suite, which debuted in South Korea in 2016 and has since expanded in scope and presence worldwide.</p><p>As <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/samsung-finally-starts-rolling-out-stable-one-ui-7-for-galaxy-s24-series">One UI 7 rolls out</a> to more Galaxy phones this month, users will find that Good Lock has been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung/samsung-good-lock-launcher-refresh-update-rolls-out">completely redesigned</a> from the ground up for Samsung's latest Android release. The old, confusing UI elements are gone, replaced with a single list of all Good Lock modules that makes it far easier to find what you want.</p><p>Samsung is the only company that offers anything like Good Lock. Some companies offer several different UI customization elements — things like optional split notification shades or ways to tweak UI colors — but Samsung Good Lock lets you change, tweak, and even add massively helpful features and new functionality to the phone you already love.</p><p>It's the best reason to buy a Samsung phone, and Samsung only has a few more steps to take to make Good Lock a one-stop shop for phone customization.</p>

<h2 id="something-for-almost-everyone-2">Something for (almost) everyone</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="3fqzNnL3N3pbAXo48sMCB7" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-good-lock-one-ui-7-multitasking-02" alt="The grid multitasking UI from a Good Lock module in One UI 7 on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3fqzNnL3N3pbAXo48sMCB7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung Good Lock is the company's attempt to please everyone with options and settings that most other phones (including its own) don't offer. From the complete customization of the quick toggles and other UI elements, multiple multitasking UI choices, unique home screen customization, and even accessibility features not found elsewhere, Good Lock is hard to beat.</p><p>But it's also more challenging to find than it should be. Good Lock is still only available <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://galaxystore.samsung.com/detail/com.samsung.android.goodlock">on the Samsung Galaxy App Store</a> (for now). That means not only do customers need to know about Good Lock's existence beforehand, but they also need to understand that the Galaxy App Store is different from the Google Play Store.</p><p>Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsungs-good-lock-is-going-global-with-a-fresh-redesign-in-one-ui-7">announced</a> that Good Lock would be coming to the Play Store with One UI 7, so it's only a matter of time as the update has just begun rolling out at the time of writing.</p><p>At the very least, Samsung should include the Good Lock launcher preinstalled on every Galaxy Phone, as it only takes up a paltry 34 MB of space as of One UI 7. This would make it much easier for users to customize their phones out of the box without having to research it and would give Samsung a wow factor that most people likely don't know exists.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Samsung should include the Good Lock launcher on every Galaxy phone instead of requiring users to find it on the Galaxy App Store.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Thankfully, the improved UI in the One UI 7 release makes finding what you want in Good Lock easy. That's quite a change from the old style, which includes weird names like QuickStar, Nice Shot, MultiStar, RegiStar, and plenty more. Some of the names make a lot more sense — Camera Assistant and Routines+ are pretty self-explanatory — and I think it would do Samsung some good to rename the weird ones into something more basic.</p><p>The new UI now includes a row of UI chips up top. These little buttons help you find settings like wallpaper, notifications, keyboard, lock screen, and others. I'd love to see Samsung add a proper search to Good Lock so we can quickly find settings throughout the suite of modules Good Lock offers, as that would offer a complete solution to finding what you want.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Good Lock 3.0 is a huge upgrade over its predecessors, but that doesn't mean there isn't room for improvement.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Lastly, I want to see some modules reach their full potential, particularly the newest one, Display Assistant. This new module was teased as giving users "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-labs-display-assistant-test">total display control</a>" but that's not actually true. The main feature revolves around giving users the ability to change the refresh rate per-app, so you can set some apps to 120Hz while others can be restricted to a lower rate to save battery.</p><p>And while Samsung gives you the option to force high brightness for longer — even if your phone starts to get very hot — it doesn't give users the option to disable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a>. Every phone from Motorola and OnePlus offers this option, while some phones from brands like Honor, Xiaomi, Oppo, and Vivo also offer this, all without having to install an additional app to do it.</p>
<h2 id="my-favorite-good-lock-modules-and-settings-2">My favorite Good Lock modules and settings</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JNVxrGyt4S5oKQyVt8uZB7" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-good-lock-one-ui-7-multitasking-01" alt="The grid multitasking UI from a Good Lock module in One UI 7 on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JNVxrGyt4S5oKQyVt8uZB7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/new-samsung-galaxy-phone-first-things">first thing I do when I get a Samsung Galaxy phone</a> is download Good Lock, then install the <strong>Home Up</strong> module. This module lets you customize not only your home screen but, most importantly for me, the multitasking UI. I absolutely <strong>abhor</strong> the stock Android multitasking UI and rank it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/best-android-multitasking-ui-ranked">among the absolute worst multitasking UIs</a> in existence. Samsung's default UI isn't much better, but Good Lock makes quick work of that.</p><p>I prefer to use the grid format UI for multitasking as it places six apps at my fingertips at all times. You can find this in the Task Changer section of the Home Up module in Good Lock, and that's just the tip of the iceberg. Head to the Home Screen section of the Home Up module and turn on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-home-up-complete-customize-demo">DIY Home Screen</a> for an experience customization junkies are sure to love.</p><p>Once you're done there, grab the <strong>QuickStar</strong> module and customize the quick toggles and notification area to your liking. I love a dense quick toggle pane as it gives me the option to quickly choose from 10-12 settings with a single tap, while the default offers just 8. It also lets you turn off some of those annoying status icons like NFC or VoLTE that don't do anything for anyone.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The first thing I swap out is the multitasking UI, followed by customizing the notification shade and quick toggles.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Next, check out both the <strong>NotiStar</strong> and <strong>Nice Catch</strong> modules. NotiStar gives you an easy way to see your notification history so you can <em>finally</em> figure out what notification you accidentally swiped away. I don't know about you, but this scenario happens to me all the time and it drives me crazy, but NotiStar completely fixes the issue. Nice Catch gives you even more ways to dive into notification history, including toast notifications, phantom vibrations, and more.</p><p>Lastly, <strong>Camera Assistant</strong> can help people who have specific problems with Samsung cameras. Don't like Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-camera-comparison">aggressive HDR algorithms</a>? Turn it off! Have issues with the software taking too long to actually take the picture after you press the shutter button?

<h2 id="what-are-you-waiting-for-2">What are you waiting for?</h2>
<p>After nearly 10 years of Good Lock's existence, it's great to see Samsung's renewed interest in building out the feature to make it the ultimate customization suite. No other brand offers something like Good Lock, even if a handful of its features are included on some others phones without an additional download.</p><p>Samsung only has a few things it could do to improve the app, mainly revolving around surfacing the app itself as well as making it easier to find specific settings. Most Good Lock modules have been built out quite a bit, but the company could offer a few more options that would really seal the deal. More display accessibility options are an absolute must, while things like the ability to add labels on quick toggle icons would be nice.</p><p>If you've got a Samsung Galaxy phone and haven't tried Good Lock, what are you waiting for? It's the best reason to own a Samsung phone and a fantastic way to make the phone feel more like <em>your phone</em> rather than just another smartphone.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google introduced an AI-based Scam Detection feature for Pixel phones as part of a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixels-march-2025-feature-drop">feature drop</a> last month. The popular feature is now being introduced to Pixel Watch models as well, the search giant announced.</p><p>In a recent Pixel Watch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelwatch/thread/336738887/scam-detection-is-now-available-on-pixel-watch-in-call?hl=en&sjid=14283440370990026999-NC">community post</a>, Google announced that it is rolling out this feature to Pixel Watch 2 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> models for the U.S. region. It promises users protection from scammers’ calls just by glancing at their wrist, provided they are connected to a Pixel 9 series phone and above.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:646px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:92.88%;"><img id="ooXk6xNch6sFiTpf7w69dC" name="google-pixel-march-feature-drop-suspicious-texts" alt="Google is rolling out scam detection measures for texts and calls on the Pixel 9 and 6." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ooXk6xNch6sFiTpf7w69dC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="646" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This Scam Detection feature identifies conversation patterns widely used by scammers, “right as they happen.” With the feature enabled, Pixel Watch owners will receive an alert mid-call of a scam, which will be received by the Bluetooth signal as the smartwatch will be paired with the aforementioned Pixel phones.</p><p>Setting up Scam Detection is also fairly simple as users need to be on the latest version of their Phone app to enable the feature. Opening the Phone app, navigating to its Settings, and turning on Scam Detection should make it up and running.</p>

<p>After enabling the feature, an audible beep can be heard at the start of the call, and it is an indication that the feature is currently ongoing in the background. Google further notes that if the scale of the scam call is high, users will be alerted with a notification, sound, and vibration, which can be dismissed or users can end the call right on their wrists.</p><p>Users have to bear in mind that the feature to work flawlessly on Pixel Watch Bluetooth connection is required, as mentioned. However, Scam Detection for direct calls over LTE on the watch itself is not supported. The feature has begun rolling out as noted is for the U.S. region starting this week, and it is in English language only, and it is unclear whether it expands to other regions anytime soon.</p>

<ul><li>The latest WhatsApp beta reportedly contains insight into a trio of updates inbound for its video and voice calling experience.</li><li>Video calls are seemingly preparing to receive a disable camera option before answering alongside emoji reactions.</li><li>Voice calls are being tested with a mute button that users can toggle before picking up a call.</li><li>WhatsApp recently dropped an AI update that lets users get more creative with their avatars and one that brings music to their statuses.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>WhatsApp has reportedly begun testing for a host of new call features that'll affect those using voice and video.</p><p>The development of the new features was spotted in a recent WhatsApp beta on Android by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-for-android-2-25-10-16-whats-new/">WABetaInfo</a>, which detailed three major additions (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sammyguru.com/whatsapp-testing-new-call-features-mute-button-camera-toggle-emoji-reactions/">SammyGuru</a>). The beta starts with an upcoming feature for video calls that aims to add a layer of privacy for users. The APK dive spotted a "turn off your video" option during the video call acceptance screen.</p><p>The post states this will let WhatsApp users "handle unfamiliar contacts" more easily since their face won't be revealed outright when answering. Previously, users were required to answer a video call before the ability to disable their camera appeared. Additionally, WhatsApp was spotted working on "emoji reactions" for video calls, specifically. The beta shows six emojis available in the sub-menu with the share screen and send message options.</p><p>If all goes well, users should see a thumbs up, heart, laughing, shocked, tearful, and prayer emoji. What the beta doesn't tease is how these emojis will appear. WhatsApp could have them float up on the screen during the video call or appear in some other flashy fashion — but nothing concrete was shown.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:981px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:61.16%;"><img id="PyRb4uqLCwkzUP9ibGjEZN" name="whatsapp-video-voice-call-features-additions-spotted" alt="WhatsApp is working on a disable camera button for video calls before answering, emoji reactions, and a mute voice option when receiving voice calls." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PyRb4uqLCwkzUP9ibGjEZN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="981" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WABetaInfo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The final addition concerns standard voice calls, as WhatsApp is working on a mute button. The post states a mute button was located in the alert within Android's notification panel when receiving a call. A user could preemptively mute their microphone before answering the call.</p><p>WABetaInfo discovered these additions in v2.25.10.16 of the WhatsApp beta on Android quite recently. As of now, there's no telling when these updates could arrive for stable users.</p><p>That's not an issue, as WhatsApp users just started <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/whatsapp-gains-upgraded-ai-avatars-adding-music-to-statuses">receiving an update</a> yesterday (Apr. 7), which brought AI avatars via the "imagine" prompt through Meta AI. Users can upload a selfie of themselves and tell the AI to imagine them with new hair or perhaps an entirely different outfit. What's more, the platform also rolled out the ability for users to add music to their shared status. Users will find a new music note icon before sharing that lets them search for song titles and artists.</p><p>On the other hand, WhatsApp <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-introduces-chat-themes-and-new-backgrounds">debuted Chat Themes</a> for users looking to bring a little more pop to their chats. The platform offered a selection of default themes while also giving users a chance to make their own.</p>

<p>Given the current economic situation, it's no wonder that many folks are switching wireless carriers to save money on their phone bill. Fortunately, we're currently in the golden age of MVNOs, and there is no shortage of excellent wireless deals to check out today. Keep reading for a selection of my favorites from this month.</p><p>An <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-mvno-carrier">MVNO</a> (mobile virtual network operator) is an alternative carrier that utilizes the vast networks of larger companies — such as Verizon, T-Mobile, or AT&T — so you get the same great coverage for cheap, without the hassle of a complicated contract or loads of hidden fees. Some of these companies might even sell you one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> at a serious discount. If you aren't totally sold on the prospect, it's also worth noting that many of the best MVNO carriers also offer free trials with zero hassle or commitment whatsoever. In other words, if you want to save some cash on your phone bill, there's almost no reason not to try an MVNO.</p>

<h2 id="should-i-switch-to-an-mvno-2">Should I switch to an MVNO?</h2>
<p>Most MVNOs provide the same great coverage as a mainstream carrier at a much lower cost, but of course, they aren't for everyone. Many companies will deprioritize you when the network becomes busy, and you may miss out on some international perks. In many cases, these alternative carriers are also digital-only, which means you won't get the convenience of a company with a local retail presence. </p><p>That said, if none of those things is a problem to you and you're sick of paying hundreds on your wireless bill every month, it might be time to switch!</p>

<p>So, you’re looking for an affordable phone that has premium features. It sounds like an impossible feat but it isn’t. There really are tons of great Android phones that don’t cost an arm and a leg but still rival some of the best phones out there when it comes to processing power, cameras, and even AI integration. Sure, you’ll make a few concessions whether it’s relating to materials, battery life, storage, or some other aspect. But for many users, these phones will do just fine.</p><p>Two models worth considering are the Moto G Stylus 2025 vs Google Pixel 9a, both of which only recently just launched and thus are probably on your radar. Here, we’ll help you choose between them.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:900px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="F9fdXF9xNJZbbuxhXqF7oj" name="motorola-g-stylus-5g-2025-deep-blue-model-holding-cropped16-9" alt="A deep blue Moto G Stylus 5G 2025 in the hands of a model with a city backdrop." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/F9fdXF9xNJZbbuxhXqF7oj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="900" height="506" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Just launched in April 2025, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/moto-g-stylus-2025-launch-details">Moto G Stylus 2025</a> comes in funky Pantone colors like Gibraltar Sea and Surf the Web and boasts a leather-inspired finish. Equipped with a 6.7-inch pOLED Super HD AMOLED screen with 2,712 x 1,220 resolution and adaptive 120Hz refresh rate, you’ll get up to 3,000 nits brightness for comfortable viewing even in bright sunlight.</p><p>The ultra-thin and lightweight phone has a 5,000 mAh battery that can last for 40+ hours: that’s almost two full days! When you need to recharge, it supports both 68W TurboPower wired charging (with an optional adapter) and 15W wireless charging. With a 68W charger, you can get another full day of use after just a 15-minute charge, so it’s worth the investment to get one.</p><p>The phone is durable, too, meeting IP68 certification for water- and dust-resistance, along with MIL-STD-810H standards. A nice inclusion is that it comes with a built-in stylus, which makes things like taking notes, navigating webpages, sketching, and even using AI features seamlessly. The stylus boasts improved responsiveness as well, compared to last year’s model.</p><p>Choose either 128GB or 256GB storage but you’re locked there unless you use the cloud as there’s no memory card slot for adding more on-board. The 5G phone has dual SIMs, NFC, GPS, and Bluetooth 5.4 along with dual stereo speakers that support Dolby Atmos and two mics.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="XFSdkoSwZq3cScHznhJeYB" name="Google-Pixel-9a-porcelain-on-grass" alt="The Porcelain Google Pixel 9a laying back-up on a mossy surface next to a plant." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XFSdkoSwZq3cScHznhJeYB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>How does the Google Pixel 9a, also arriving in early April, compare? It’s pretty similar. It comes in Iris, Peony, Porcelain, or Obsidian with a composite matte back and satin metal finish. The Corning Gorilla Glass 3 Actua OLED screen is smaller at 6.3 inches boasting a lesser 2,424 x 1,080 resolution, 60-120Hz adaptive refresh rate, and up to 2,700 nits brightness. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-hands-on">Michael L. Hicks says in his early hands-on</a> that it’s the first hard-edges, no-camera-bar Pixel he has seen to date. There’s no camera bar, however, a design choice to make room for a larger battery. Indeed, he admits it’s very rare to see a battery this large in a phone so thin, and that’s a good thing.</p><p>Also thin and lightweight, though it’s a smidge lighter, the Google Pixel 9a has a 5,100mAh battery, the largest yet for a Pixel phone, along with a larger vapor chamber for keeping it cool while multitasking or especially gaming. You’ll get an impressive 30+ hours of use per charge, but you can extend this to up to 100 hours, or just over four days, using Extreme Battery Saver mode. It supports both fast and wireless charging as well, but at a much slower rate of 23W and 7.5W, respectively.</p><p>There’s no stylus with this phone, but it does offer the same IP68 rating along with a fingerprint-resistant design. It, too, comes with either 128GB or 256GB storage, which is non-expandable.</p><p>As a 5G phone as well, you’ll get the same NFC, GPS, dual SIM, and stereo speakers with a pair of mics (no Dolby Atmos support), and it offers Bluetooth 5.3 instead. There are some useful inclusions with this phone, however, so you can get more from it out of the box. This includes a three-month subscription to Google One for additional cloud storage, three months of access to YouTube Premium, and six months of Fitbit Premium, ideal to use alongside an accessory like the Google Pixel Watch 3.</p>

<p>Let’s look at the specs of these two phones in a side-by-side comparison.</p>

<h2 id="moto-g-stylus-2025-vs-google-pixel-9a-what-can-these-phones-do-2">Moto G Stylus 2025 vs Google Pixel 9a: What can these phones do?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:900px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="WDSd35TFNTjnorKUaZhtA4" name="motorola-g-stylus-5g-2025-deep-blue-option-table-cropped-16-9" alt="A deep blue Motorola G Stylus 5G 2025 with its stylus beside it on a white table." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WDSd35TFNTjnorKUaZhtA4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="900" height="506" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, it’s time to get busy with these two phones. What can they do?</p><p>The Moto G Stylus 2025 comes out of the box with Android 15 and comes with two OS updates and three years of bi-monthly security patches. So it will last you for some time, but not as long as the Google Pixel 9a.</p><p>Running on a Snapdragon 6 Gen 3 processor, you’ll get 8GB RAM with the RAM Boost feature that can use reserve storage as RAM. Historically, however, we have found this feature to be finicky and typically not worth leveraging.</p><p>You’ll find Google’s AI features and Moto AI processing, mainly for use with the camera. Thanks to the included stylus, this phone is great for both productivity and creativity. There’s nothing particularly groundbreaking about this phone, but it has all the usuals you’d expect in a Moto device like Moto Secure, Family Space, and Moto Unplugged.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="CQMLXkYkiTBxB7v3NtevHB" name="Google-Pixel-9a-display-lock-screen" alt="The Google Pixel 9a held in the photographer's hand.

<p>The Google Pixel 9a is an AI user’s dream thanks to deep integration with Google Gemini, which you’ll find in the entire Pixel 9 series as well as older models. Google also supports this phone with a whopping seven years of OS and security updates along with frequent Pixel Drops, so you’ll get a lot bang for your buck. It comes out of the box with the latest Android 15 OS.</p><p>The Google Tensor G4 processor affords a smooth experience alongside Titan M2 security, though benchmarks have historically shown that it falls short of Snapdragon-powered phones. It has the same 8GB RAM and adds useful features Pixel owners have come to love, like Pixel Call Assist, Clear Calling, Call Screen, and Hold for Me.</p><p>There are also useful safety features like car crash detection that will call emergency services for you, emergency SOS, crisis alerts, VPN by Google, and the option to auto-lock the device should it be lost or stolen. There’s also built-in anti-malware and anti-phishing features, so you can be assured that you’re getting an iron-clad experience.</p><p>The big differentiator here is that Google has built Gemini right into the phone, so you get access to the AI assistant to help with just about any task, question, or activity you’re performing.</p>

<p>Now, let’s turn our attention to the cameras. The Moto G Stylus 2025 has a 50MP main camera with a Sony LYTIA 700C sensor and OIS complemented by a 13MP rear ultra-wide camera with macro vision and a 32MP front camera. There’s also a 3-in-1 light sensor in the rear camera. It can also shoot 4K videos with features like slow motion.</p><p>There are tons of camera features, like ultra-res, portrait, pro, 360° panorama, night vision, RAW, HDR, tilt-shift, and even a scan option, powered by Adobe Scan. Leveraging Moto AI processing, you can also enjoy features like auto smile capture, Google Lens, and more.</p><p>The stylus has a neat feature called Sketch to Image whereby you can use AI to bring your drawings to life in Moto Note. Additionally, AI is used through the photo enhancement engine, which analyzes frames to help preserve details and yield the best possible results. Google Photos AI, meanwhile, further helps you fine-tune your images. You can also leverage the stylus to use features like Google’s Circle to Search, which is available on this phone, too.</p><p>We haven’t yet had the chance to try the cameras but can bring more insights soon.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="BZ8A3X23iMhCNKXGcVNDwA" name="Google-Pixel-9a-porcelain-close-up" alt="A close-up of the new camera module on the Google Pixel 9a." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BZ8A3X23iMhCNKXGcVNDwA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Comparatively, the Google Pixel 9a has a 48MP wide main camera, 13MP ultra-wide, and 13MP front camera, so you might not get selfies that are as good. The real magic comes with Google's incredible photo editing features.</p><p>Along with night sight, macro focus, and long exposure, you can play around with features like Add Me, which allows the photographer to add themselves to a group shot after the fact; Best Take, Face Unblur, and Magic Editor for removing distracting elements from a photo, repositioning subjects, and more. There are also features like Super Res Zoom.</p><p>We’re reviewing this phone right now, so stay tuned for more!</p>

<p>It’s a truly tough decision between the Moto G Stylus 2025 vs. Google Pixel 9a. Both are new phones and affordable options in the line. They boast similar specs with some minor differences. The Moto G Stylus 2025 is cheaper, but you’re missing out on the deep Google AI integration.</p><p>The Moto G Stylus 2025 is the bigger phone with the included stylus that’s a no-brainer for those who love to use one (though you could buy one of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-stylus-android-phones-and-tablets">the best stylus</a> separately to use with the Google Pixel 9a if you really wanted to). Both phones are equally durable and both offer fantastic battery life.</p><p>Based on specs alone, the Moto G Stylus 2025 has better cameras, but the Google Pixel 9a can’t be beat when it comes to photo editing and being able to correct otherwise throwaway shots or capturing images you might not otherwise be able to get (like a group shot without having to ask a passer-by to take it).</p><p>Historically, Google Pixel phones are reliable and excel in virtually every department, and the Google Pixel 9a is no exception. It’s not a massive step down from the more expensive Google Pixel 9, which offers faster charging, improved cameras, and more RAM. Considering the price, that’s a pretty enticing value proposition.</p><p>Because of this heavy integration with AI, all the add-ons you get, and the lengthy support of seven years, we’d go with the Google Pixel 9a over the Moto G Stylus 2025. But, if you want the stylus, you love Moto phones, need a bigger screen, and want to enjoy ultra-fast recharging, the Moto G Stylus 2025 isn’t a bad choice by any means.</p>

<p>The Moto G Stylus series from Motorola has been our go-to recommendation if you need an Android phone with a bundled stylus. It's not on the same level as a Galaxy S25 Ultra but you're also paying less than half the price. 2024's Moto G Sylus 5G was a fantastic offering for the price, and Motorola has made <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/moto-g-stylus-2025-launch-details">the 2025 model</a> even better for the exact same $399 price tag.</p><p>If you're trying to decide between the Moto G Stylus 2025 vs. Moto G Stylus 5G 2024, we've got you covered. The new model does come with a host of improvements that makes a good phone even better, and offers stiff competition to something like the Samsung Galaxy A36 at the same price. But with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-stylus-5g-2024-review">2024 Moto G Stylus</a> retailing for a lot less, that could still be a good alternative if you're looking to save big. Let's compare both and see which is best for you.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4185px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="gbAsngyouuToAza7PW3Kyf" name="Moto-G-Stylus-5G-2024-review-15.jpg" alt="The Moto G Stylus 5G 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gbAsngyouuToAza7PW3Kyf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4185" height="2354" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The new Moto G Stylus 2025 retains the same vegan-leather back panel that we all love. The design closely resembles what we've seen on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-power-2025-review">Moto G Power 2025</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-2025-review">Moto G 2025</a>, making the new Stylus look nearly identical to them with the four cutouts in the camera island. The colors are one way of telling them apart as the 2025 Moto G Stylus comes in Pantone Gibraltar Sea and Pantone Surf the Web, both different shades of blue. This might be disappointing to some since the 2024 Moto G Stylus came in Caramel Latte and Scarlet Wave shades.</p><p>The Moto G Stylus 2025 has the same 6.7-inch display size as the older model, but this pOLED panel now sports a higher 3,000 nits of brightness. It's a full-HD resolution with a 120Hz refresh rate, which checks all the boxes.</p><p>The Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 has nearly the same dimensions and weight as the new phone, so it won't feel much different. The vegan leather back offers good grip and gives it a classy look. In fact, we thought it looked way more premium than its asking price, and that's always a good thing. We found the display to be fantastic too with good legibility outdoors, despite the peak brightness of 1,200 nits. It too is a pOLED panel with a full-HD resolution and 120Hz refresh rate.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:900px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="F9fdXF9xNJZbbuxhXqF7oj" name="motorola-g-stylus-5g-2025-deep-blue-model-holding-cropped16-9" alt="A deep blue Moto G Stylus 5G 2025 in the hands of a model with a city backdrop." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/F9fdXF9xNJZbbuxhXqF7oj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="900" height="506" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Moto G Stylus 2025 comes with 8GB RAM and either 128GB or 256GB of storage. It's powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 6 Gen 3 SoC, which on paper, should be slightly faster than the Gen 1 chip in the 2024 model. NFC is present and you get wide 5G compatibility with all the major U.S. carriers. Performance of the new Moto G Stylus should be similar to what we experienced with the 2024 model, which is to say, quite good.</p><p>The phone has the same battery capacity as the older one, but charging is way quicker. The Moto G Stylus 2025 features a 5,000mAh battery with 68W TurboPower fast charging and 15W wireless charging. The only catch is that the wired charger needs to be bought separately. The Type-C port is still the USB 2.0 standard but the wireless connectivity has been upgraded to Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.4.</p><p>The camera sensor sizes of both phones are the same, but the 2025 Moto G Stylus uses a Sony LYTIA 700C 50MP sensor which should deliver better low-light images. The secondary camera is a 13MP ultrawide with macro capabilities. The third cutout on the back is actually a 3-in-1 light sensor for more accurate light metering in photos. You get a 32MP camera in the front. The phone can record up to 4K 30fps videos with the front and rear main cameras.</p>

<p>The 2024 Moto G Stylus launched at $399 on May 9, 2024, and the Moto G Stylus 5G costs exactly the same at launch. You can now find the 2024 model for as low as $250 on places like Amazon. This makes it incredibly good value since you're getting some premium features at bargain prices.</p><p>We found the performance to be more than adequate too thanks to the Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 SoC and 8GB of RAM. There's 128GB or 256GB of storage, depending on which region you buy it from. This storage is also expandable, which is a rare sight these days.</p><p>We found the battery life to be excellent as well. The 5,000mAh capacity didn't give us the two-day run we expected, but it's good enough to last at least one full day with heavy use. Charging speed is decently quick at 30W, and you get 15W wireless charging too.</p><p>The cameras on the Moto G Stylus 2024 really surprised us as we weren't expecting a whole lot. The sensor resolution of all the cameras is the same as the 2025 model, and so are most of the capabilities.</p>

<p>The software experience should be nearly identical on both phones. The 2024 Moto G Stylus shipped with Android 14 along with Motorola's Hello UX customizations. You have acces to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini app </a>and other smart features like AI wallpaper. There's only one OS upgrade planned for this phone though so it won't go beyond Android 15.</p><p>The 2025 Moto G Stylus ships with Android 15, and Motorola has pledged two OS upgrades and three years of bi-monthly security updates. Our one big gripe with the 2024 model was the annoying Glance lockscreen program, which we hope has been done away with on the new iteration.</p><p>The built-in stylus is one of the main draws for this phone, and it works well. We're yet to test it on the 2025 model but it doesn't seem like Motorola has given it any major upgrades. It's a handy tool to have for quickly taking notes, annotating on screenshots, doing digital signatures, sketching, and so on.</p>

<p>The Moto G Stylus 2025 is easily the better phone compared to the 2024 model. The display is brighter, it chargers faster, it has better ingress protection and durability ratings, it supports newer wireless standards, and the main camera should perform a notch better.</p><p>At $400 though, there's also the Samsung Galaxy A36 to consider which has roughly the same specs but with six years (vs. two) of OS upgrades, and a more premium glass back design.</p><p>If you're not too fussed about the upgraded features in the 2025 Moto G Stylus, the 2024 model is one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentrahttps://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phonesl.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best cheap phones</a> at nearly $250. But it only supports up to Android 15, and then you won't get any more OS updates. This, plus the significant bump in durability, are solid reasons why the Moto G Stylus 2025 is worth upgrading to.</p>

<ul><li>All Pixel Watch models seem to be receiving BP1A.250305.019.W7 build firmware as part of the new April Wear OS update.</li><li>While the changelog from Google is yet to go live, the update appears to be addressing issues such as delayed notifications and battery-draining problems that arose from the March update.</li><li>While it is an April update, it is believed to be still incorporating the March security patch.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is releasing fresh updates for its Pixel Watch models, which seem to be the monthly update that focuses mostly on bug fixes while maintaining the security patch from March.</p><p>As noted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/04/07/pixel-watch-april-2025-update/">9to5Google</a>, the search giant has started rolling out this year's April update for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> alongside the older Pixel Watch 2 and the original Pixel Watch. It is believed to be based on the Wear OS 5.1 update, which was rolled out last month. The Android 15-based update bearing <strong>BP1A.250305.019.W7</strong> has started appearing on the aforementioned Pixel Watch models.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="d48rhpLLvxaAKFhsSooiQc" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-downloading-update-forced.jpg" alt="Downloading an update on the Pixel Watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/d48rhpLLvxaAKFhsSooiQc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The publication also points out that, unlike last month's updates, which divided the build numbers among smartwatches — with the latest one, all Pixel Watch models are said to be now running the same builds. While the changelog of the April update is yet to go live on Google's community page, the firmware for the above-mentioned Pixel Watch models is already live on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developers.google.com/android/ota-watch">Google Developers site</a>.</p><p>9to5 further notes that the update is primarily focused on bug fixes and users would still be staying on the March security patch. These bug fixes are likely to address the delayed notifications issue and battery draining problems, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/wear-os-5-1-seems-to-have-come-with-multiple-bugs">surfaced from the March update</a>, and the company promised to roll out a fix soon. We should be knowing more of the firmware when Google releases the full changelog this week.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Pixel Watch, Watch 2, and Watch 3 owners can either download and manually install the firmware or head over to the smartwatch's <em><strong>Settings> System> System Updates </strong></em>and wait for the OTA update to arrive.</p><p>On the other hand, after releasing monthly minor updates over the years, Google has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5-1-kicks-off-new-update-strategy-for-pixel-watches">announced</a> that it would be bringing substantial quarterly updates from now on and it started with the Wear OS 5.1 update in March and the next one is likely geared up for this June.</p>

<hr>
<p>Motorola's next-gen phone to encourage productivity and creativity is finally arriving for U.S.-based consumers.</p><p>The Motorola G Stylus (2025) was announced in a press release early today (Apr. 8) with an enhanced stylus experience and a "striking" design. Leading off the launch is a 6.7-inch Super HD pOLED screen with a max 120Hz refresh rate. Motorola highlights the 2025 G Stylus display's 3,000nits of brightness, which it claims will keep its visuals high even in bright scenarios.</p><p>Keeping your G Stylus strong and durable is the military standard MIL-STD-810H rating, as well as IP68 water protection. Motorola states its focus on improving the phone's durability should help shield it from falls (~1.5 meters) and from being submerged in water (~1.5 meters up to 30 mins).</p><p>The back of the G Stylus 2025 features a premium leather finish around its camera array. This square housing consists of a 50MP Sony Lytia 700C sensor with OIS, a 13MP ultrawide lens (with macro lens integration), and a 3-in-1 light sensor. Motorola highlights its camera support for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a>, which delivers the "Photo Enhancement Engine."</p><p>The post states this feature works "automatically" to blend exposures and "preserve" your photo's rich colors and fine details. Additionally, the G Stylus 2025 contains AI features in Google Photos, which the company states may come in handy.</p>

<p>As it says in the name, the stylus that Motorola's next-gen phone comes with has been outfitted with improvements to pair well with Sketch to Image and Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>. The company says users can opt to use the provided stylus to circle, highlight, or "tap text or images" to utilize Circle to Search's capabilities. Regarding Sketch to Image, potential G Stylus 2025 users can leverage the pen and Moto Note to put a new spin on their handmade doodles.</p><p>Elsewhere, the stylus' upgrades include a 6.4x boost in responsiveness when compared to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-stylus-5g-2024-review">the 2024 model</a>.</p><p>Empowering your daily tasks on the G Stylus is Qualcomm's Snapdragon 6 Gen 3 SoC. Additionally, users will find a 5,000mAh battery that will supposedly deliver roughly 40 hours of use on a single charge. Of course, its true usage times may vary depending on use, so be aware. The battery is paired with a 68W wired TurboPower charger and 15W wireless charging. Its wired charging method is said to give users "enough power for the day" on just a 15-minute charge cycle.</p><p>Other specs include Android 15, 8GB of RAM, and 256GB of internal storage. Motorola expresses its inclusion of Moto Secure and ThinkShield to help protect users. The device has also been granted 2 major OS upgrades and three years of bi-monthly security updates.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I generally like Seagate products, and while an overwhelming majority of my use case has to do with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/i-clocked-nearly-40-000-hours-on-this-nas-hdd-and-its-back-down-to-its-lowest-price">IronWolf drives</a>, the brand is doing all the right things with external SSDs. I recently tested its sub-brand LaCie's<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/lacie-rugged-pro5-ssd-thunderbolt-5-fastest-ssd-ive-ever-used"> Thunderbolt 5-enabled rugged SSD</a> and came away thinking my high-end gaming machine (with an RTX 5090) is the bottleneck in realizing the drive's true potential, and the One Touch SSDs are a great alternative if you don't need Thunderbolt storage.</p>

<p>Seagate's latest product is just as interesting, if targeted at a niche. The brand partnered with MiHoYo to launch the Genshin Impact Limited Edition External SSD, and it looks incredible. I'm liking the sudden influx of accessories based on the game — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/ugreen-genshin-impact-charging-accessories">UGREEN sent me a massive Genshin Impact package</a> containing uniquely-styled power banks and chargers — and Seagate's SSD combines a great visual aesthetic with 24/7 reliability.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="gub3KPwDqBW3A3JxXGiYK5" name="Seagate Genshin Impact Limited Edition External SSD" alt="Seagate Genshin Impact Limited Edition External SSD hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gub3KPwDqBW3A3JxXGiYK5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Seagate is using Cyno as the inspiration, and the etched design clearly differentiates the SSD. The vivid purple color scheme is fabulous, and the side along with the back have etched runic patterns that add to its overall flamboyance. While most external SSDs look quite good in their own right, the Genshin Impact drive is definitely in a league of its own when it comes to the design, and I don't believe I've used a drive that stands out quite as much.</p>

<p>The SSD connects via USB-C 3.2, and there's a tiny LED indicator that lights up when it's active. Adding to the vibrancy of the drive is a purple LED light bar on the other end, and I appreciate the attention to detail Seagate lavished on the SSD. I used dozens of gaming-themed accessories in the past that amounted to nothing more than a logo or a decal, but Seagate put in the work to customize the SSD extensively.</p>

<p>The drive is a little wider than most external SSDs, but it's still easily portable, and at 65g, it doesn't make any noticeable difference in your bag. Seagate bundles a USB-C to USB-C cable in the package, and while it is on the shorter side, there are no issues when connecting the drive to phones, tablets, and handhelds like the Steam Deck.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="W2kigpMCZxQE6MtwEJAfN5" name="Seagate Genshin Impact Limited Edition External SSD" alt="Seagate Genshin Impact Limited Edition External SSD hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/W2kigpMCZxQE6MtwEJAfN5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I used the SSD to move data to and from my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-ultra-review">Xiaomi 15 Ultra</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Honor Magic 7 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-ipad-pro-m4-13-inch-long-term-review">iPad Pro M4</a>, and it did a rock-solid job with data transfers. The only quibble is that the bundled cable was too short to connect to my gaming machine, so I used a USB 4 cable instead.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="BR8WC9mbXZvtn42xdQmJL5" name="Seagate Genshin Impact Limited Edition External SSD" alt="Seagate Genshin Impact Limited Edition External SSD hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BR8WC9mbXZvtn42xdQmJL5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Other than that, I didn't see any problems moving over data from Windows. The drive uses exFAT out of the box to ensure it can be used with the widest range of devices, but you can easily format it should you wish to switch to NTFS. The drive is just as fast as other external SSDs I tested, going up to 980MB/s with reads and 300MB/s writes.</p>

<p>Although most external SSDs I use have 4TB of storage, Seagate is selling the Genshin Impact Limited Edition External SSD in a single 1TB variant. It's still decent enough storage for most users, but if you're looking at this as an external SSD to store games, there isn't much in the way of headroom — a 2TB option would have been ideal.</p>

<p>Overall, Seagate did a magnificent job with the Genshin Impact Limited Edition External SSD, and the only real limitation with the drive has to do with availability. It is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.seagate.com/products/gaming-drives/special-editions/genshin-impact-external-ssd/?sku=STMU1000402">sold exclusively on Seagate's U.S. website</a>, and at $139, it has a sizeable premium — the 1TB variant of the One Touch SSD can be bought for as low as $84. But if you're a Genshin Impact fan and want an SSD that stands out, this is obviously the one to get. Seagate says it will only sell the drive until quantities last, so if you like the look of this SSD, you'll need to act now.</p>

<p>Samsung Galaxy S25 users are in for a unique set of AI capabilities. The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-introduces-real-time-visual-ai-galaxy-s25-series-gemini-live-update/?utm_source=pr_media&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=general">announced</a> in a press release that starting today (April 7) that through a new software update, the Galaxy S25 series will be able to have real-time visual conversations on their phones with Gemini Live.</p><p>Users will now be able to trigger Gemini Live with just a click of a button and have a full blown interactive video conversation with it. To summon the AI assistant, "Just press and hold the side button to show Gemini Live what you see while simultaneously interacting with it in a live conversation."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="q6fHRLDQ9WnHw8QUnK6U6Z" name="Samsung-Galaxy-s25-Gemini-live" alt="Samsung Introduces Real-Time Visual AI on Galaxy S25 Series With Gemini Live Update" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/q6fHRLDQ9WnHw8QUnK6U6Z.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is specifically useful for when you need help picking out an outfit for a date night or reorganizing a closet based on Mary Kondo's method. Gemini Live could be your stylist without you needing to spend the money on hiring one. And here's how its done, "simply point the camera to the object and users can get suggestions on how to categorize items and optimize space, or share their screen while browsing online retailers to receive personalized style advice."</p><p>With this ability, your phone becomes more of your sidekick when your bestie isn't answering the call. This will create a whole new outlook for how we use AI in this day and age."With this new visual capability, the Galaxy S25 series brings next-generation AI experiences to life, setting new standards for how users engage with the world through their devices,” said  Jay Kim, executive vice president in the presser.</p>

<p>This ability will start rolling out to Galaxy S25 series users at no additional cost through a software update. However, Android Central folks who own one of these devices are yet to see an update on their end, hinting that this could be rolling out in phases.</p><p>Google has also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-lives-video-streaming-screen-sharing-support-comes-to-pixel-9-series">rolled out</a> this feature to the Pixel series 9. Gemini Live's new video streaming and screen-sharing features are now reaching all users with the latest flagship phones.</p><p>In other news, Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/samsung-finally-starts-rolling-out-stable-one-ui-7-for-galaxy-s24-series">has finally started rolling out </a>its most awaited software update, the One UI 7 to some users in Korea. The first ones to get this update patch are Galaxy S24, Z Fold 6, and Z Flip 6 users who were using beta and non-beta versions of the Android 15 operating system. This 5.2GB update comes with new features, improvements, and Galaxy AI tricks that everyone has been waiting for. As for the people in the U.S., they will start seeing an update rollout on April 10, according to the company's announcement.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Over the past few years, I've written about how Chromebooks are the perfect devices for Arm processors. No, I'm not talking about the ones that we already have, I'm talking about the ones that are found in a lot of fantastic Windows laptops. Which includes Qualcomm's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/its-time-for-a-new-wave-of-chromebooks">Snapdragon X Elite</a>, which debuted in late 2023.</p><p>I was hopeful that, <em>eventually,</em> Chromebook makers would get around to at least offering <em>something</em> with a flagship Arm SoC; as it turns out, we are, just not from Qualcomm. Instead, MediaTek is swooping in with its recent announcement of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek/mediatek-kompanio-ultra-next-gen-chromebook-plus-announced" target="_blank">Kompanio Ultra</a>, designed specifically "for the next generation of Chromebook Plus devices."</p><p>There are a couple of big selling points for processors using this architecture, as opposed to x86. Having a Chromebook that is both powerful and battery-efficient is pretty much the dream. As it currently stands, you can pick one or the other, but very few of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">best Chromebooks</a> manage to achieve both.</p>
<h2 id="what-matters-most-2">What matters most</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5013px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bq3EQxMrgCdfurPuTri3LB" name="android-tablet-ui-on-surface-pro-11" alt="Android tablet UI on Microsoft Surface Pro 11" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bq3EQxMrgCdfurPuTri3LB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5013" height="2820" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Meanwhile, Arm-powered laptops are usually lighter and more compact, making them perfect for students. This is partially why Lenovo's Chromebook Duet line remains a fan favorite. It's compact and powerful (enough) while also being pretty affordable compared to other tablets and laptops.</p><p>While I love the Duet, especially the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-tablets/lenovo-chromebook-duet-11-review">Duet 11</a>, it still doesn't scratch the itch for me in the same way that my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/laptops/surface-pro-11-review">Surface Pro 11</a> does. To be clear, these are not competitors in anything other than form factor, as the Surface starts at $999 for the base model Snapdragon X Plus or $1,499 for the X Elite. Meanwhile, the Duet 11 retails for $399 in its base configuration, which happens to include a keyboard folio cover and a stylus, two things you'll have to pay extra for with the Surface.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1587px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.20%;"><img id="PBT65PjvTomAXKKZrkDTYk" name="mediatek-kompanio-ultra-infographic" alt="The MediaTek Kompanio Ultra delivers the 50 TOPS NPU for quicker generative AI processes on Chromebooks." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PBT65PjvTomAXKKZrkDTYk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1587" height="876" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: MediaTek)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That being said, when introducing the Kompanio Ultra, MediaTek hit all of the important talking points for someone who wants a powerful and efficient device. Battery life is rated for up to 20 hours on a single charge, thanks in part to it consuming up to "50% less power vs. competition."</p><p>The Ultra even supports LPDDR5X memory, is built on a 3nm process, and features an "all-big-core CPU structure." As a result, MediaTek claims the Ultra will provide "up to 18% faster CPU performance" while making it possible to play the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-games">best Android games</a> at a stable 60fps. Oh, and for you AI enthusiasts, the Ultra's NPU 890 has you covered with its 50 TOPS NPU for "greater on-device generative AI processes."</p>
<h2 id="chromebook-plus-expansion-2">Chromebook Plus expansion</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="o4zf8xncr7Eii4ZVaJ3BmZ" name="Acer Chromebook Plus Spin 714 with lid closed" alt="Acer Chromebook Plus Spin 714 with lid closed" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o4zf8xncr7Eii4ZVaJ3BmZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>So far, it seems that MediaTek absolutely nailed it, and now we just have to wait for new Chromebooks to arrive. This leads me to something that's arguably just as important as getting flagship Arm chips, and that's an expansion to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/chromebook-plus-features-rolling-out">Chromebook Plus</a> requirements.</p><p>This part of the announcement kind of flew under the radar and wasn't even something that I immediately noticed when going through the press materials. Until now, Chromebook Plus models have been required to rely on either an Intel Core i3 12th Gen or higher or an AMD Ryzen 3 5000 series or higher.</p><p>Which has left some very good options from receiving the Chromebook Plus branding on the lid. This includes the Chromebook Duet 11, which technically meets all of Google's requirements except for the Kompanio 838 processor. As such, the Duet 11 is <em>just</em> a Chromebook and not a "Plus."</p>
<h2 id="time-for-a-refresh-2">Time for a refresh</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="PBrVPSGcUJo6SGJDDWgCK9" name="acer-chromebook-spin-714-2023-review-3.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook Spin 714" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PBrVPSGcUJo6SGJDDWgCK9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is huge, as it could spawn a wave of new and exciting Chromebooks, all powered by MediaTek. I don't want to put the cart before the horse just yet, but so far, things are looking promising. I just still can't help but wonder why Qualcomm stood by and did nothing, only to let MediaTek reap the rewards.</p><p>Funnily enough, maybe the here existence of this article will result in Qualcomm announcing a new chip for Chromebooks in the coming weeks. Hey, apparently, it worked after I wrote about whether we were witnessing a slow death for Chromebooks, so it could work for Qualcomm, too, right?</p>

<p>Meta is kicking off its multimodal Llama 4 series with two fresh models: the lean-and-mean Scout and the powerhouse Maverick. The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/llama-4-multimodal-intelligence/" target="_blank">says</a> these new models are beating the competition pretty much across the board in early tests.</p><p>Maverick is the series' all-around workhorse, built to handle both text and visuals and is ideal for things like smart assistants and chat interfaces. On the flip side, Scout is the lighter, sharper one. It’s the one you want when you’re knee-deep in documents, untangling complex requests, or piecing together logic in massive codebases.</p><p>Llama 4 Scout and Maverick are now up for grabs on Llama.com and through Meta’s partners, including Hugging Face. Meta is also baking the new models into its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-ai-apps-llama-3-launch">Meta AI</a> assistant, which is already rolling out across apps like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whatsapp">WhatsApp</a>, Messenger, and Instagram in 40 countries. That said, the multimodal features are U.S.-only and English-only for the time being.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="mcZuz4FUtYqRxDw9mDJpPB" name="Llama-4-series" alt="Llama 4 series models comparative chart" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mcZuz4FUtYqRxDw9mDJpPB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<h2 id="moe-power-2">MoE power</h2>
<p>Meta says Llama 4 is a big step forward under the hood. It’s the company's first time using a Mixture of Experts (MoE) setup. This makes things run smoother and faster, both when training the model and answering your questions. Basically, MoE works by breaking down heavy tasks into smaller chunks and handing them off to specialized mini-networks.</p><p>Scout packs 17 billion active parameters spread across 16 expert modules. According to Meta's specs, this setup outperforms Google’s Gemma 3, Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite, and the open-source Mistral 3.1 on a bunch of common benchmarks, while keeping a lean profile that lets it run smoothly on just one Nvidia H100 GPU.</p><p>Scout shines when it comes to tasks like squeezing down huge amounts of text and making logical calls within big codebases. One standout feature is its massive context window, handling up to 10 million tokens. This means Scout can handle both text and visual data on a massive scale.</p>
<h2 id="maverick-s-strength-2">Maverick’s strength</h2>
<p>Meta gives Maverick the same accolade, saying it stacks up well against OpenAI’s GPT-4 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-stable-version-of-gemini-2-0-flash-is-rolling-out-now-in-the-gemini-app">Google’s Gemini 2.0 Flash</a>. What’s impressive is that it delivers similar results to DeepSeek-V3 for coding and logic, but with fewer than half the active parameters.</p><p>Maverick has 17 billion parameters spread across 128 expert networks. That said, Maverick doesn’t quite match up to Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro, Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet, or OpenAI’s GPT-4.5 when it comes to top-tier performance.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:85.31%;"><img id="82GbRzU79w98x2MzqKbEfC" name="Llama-4-Maverick-benchmarks" alt="Llama 4 Maverick benchmarks" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/82GbRzU79w98x2MzqKbEfC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1638" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Meta has also teased the Llama 4 Behemoth, which is still in training. When it’s ready, the company expects it to be one of the smartest LLMs out there.</p><p>Behemoth packs 288 billion active parameters across 16 experts, with a total parameter count nearing two trillion. Early tests show Behemoth outshines GPT-4.5, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.0 Pro in STEM tasks, especially when it comes to solving math problems. However, it still hasn’t surpassed Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-is-gifting-its-best-ai-model-yet-gemini-2-5-pro-exp-to-free-users">Gemini 2.5 Pro</a> in overall performance.</p><p>Essentially, everything in Meta’s apps that taps into AI is getting smarter, thanks to more advanced logic in the system. This means you’ll see sharper responses, better image generation, and ads that hit closer to the mark.</p>

I've always enjoyed using the Apple Watch for the consistency, but the ScanWatch Nova has a much better design, and I like the hybrid nature; it isn't a full-fledged smartwatch, so it lasts well over two weeks on average. <br><br>Honor's latest wearable — the Watch 5 Ultra — aims to strike a good balance in this regard. It is a smartwatch similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a> and other options in this category, but it misses out on Wear OS 5; Honor is instead using a lightweight variant of its Magic OS skin. While this means you don't get the ability to install any apps outside of those bundled with the watch, the upside is battery life — the Watch 5 Ultra easily lasts up to two weeks between charges.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="uviVgJKy5XbvPEyZb22XMU" name="Honor Watch 5 Ultra" alt="Wearing the Honor Watch 5 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uviVgJKy5XbvPEyZb22XMU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Ultra moniker is misleading here, as the Watch 5 Ultra doesn't quite have the same level of software polish or allure as the Galaxy Watch Ultra and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>. That said, it is much more affordable, coming in at €279 ($306) once it goes on sale in the coming weeks. The biggest downside to the watch is the lack of Wear OS, but Honor did a decent enough job with the bundled utilities, and it gets a lot right.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="pfJbY2JgwUnEaWh5WmDTGU" name="Honor Watch 5 Ultra" alt="Honor Watch 5 Ultra rotating crown with a colorful background in the back" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pfJbY2JgwUnEaWh5WmDTGU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What I like the most about the smartwatch is the design; Honor really outdid itself in this area, and the Watch 5 Ultra clearly looks the part of a high-end smartwatch. The case itself is made out of a titanium alloy, and the octagonal design gives it an added flair — it stands out quite a bit from the usual sea of Android smartwatches. The use of a titanium alloy means it isn't quite as heavy while still offering excellent durability, and I have zero issues on the design side of things.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PfxpP4jzNiBhqphw9ziQGU" name="Honor Watch 5 Ultra" alt="Honor Watch 5 Ultra default band" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PfxpP4jzNiBhqphw9ziQGU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Honor sells the smartwatch with a fluoroelastomer band as standard, and it has a good range of adjustability. The band is comfortable to wear, and doesn't add too much weight overall, and if you need to, you can easily switch it out — the smartwatch uses standard 22mm lugs.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="czCouA6NuirWGveD6GP5FU" name="Honor Watch 5 Ultra" alt="Wearing the Honor Watch 5 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/czCouA6NuirWGveD6GP5FU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The angular design of the Watch 5 Ultra contrasts well with the button on the right that doubles as the rotating crown, and the red accent distinguishes the otherwise understated design a little. The crown makes it easy to interact with the interface, and there's a second button on the right that is configurable; it launches workouts by default.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fhv9x6qeQmitjfLamBZw9U" name="Honor Watch 5 Ultra" alt="Honor Watch 5 Ultra against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fhv9x6qeQmitjfLamBZw9U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The defining characteristic of the smartwatch is the massive 46mm size; it adds to its presence in a considerable way, and makes it look considerably bigger than its rivals. That said, the upside is that you have a sizeable 1.5-inch AMOLED panel that goes up to 60Hz, and it gets bright in outdoor use. What's notable is the use of LTPO tech to deliver better battery life, and this definitely makes a difference.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="UmtCKYSbDcSUrnVQsbB7JU" name="Honor Watch 5 Ultra" alt="Honor Watch 5 Ultra against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UmtCKYSbDcSUrnVQsbB7JU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I had no issues whatsoever while using the watch outdoors, and while the customizability isn't quite as extensive as what you get with Wear OS — you can't install custom faces — the selection included out of the box is exhaustive, so I didn't feel like I was missing out in this area. The bezels are relatively thin as well, and this also goes a long way in creating that upmarket look.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JuEiAi9zeprrNLXFRhi9JU" name="Honor Watch 5 Ultra" alt="Honor Watch 5 Ultra next to Withings ScanWatch Nova" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JuEiAi9zeprrNLXFRhi9JU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Although the watch is huge, it isn't particularly heavy at 51g — the ScanWatch Nova is heavier — but you still get a good heft. There's just a single sizing option, and you miss out on cellular connectivity as well. That said, if you want a bigger smartwatch with a differentiated design, the Watch 5 Ultra ticks all the right boxes.</p>

<p>But it's the software where the Watch 5 Ultra runs into severe limitations. Honor did a good job with the lightweight interface, and it has good fluidity, but it is pretty basic, and you can't get the likes of Spotify or Uber on the smartwatch. That said, there are no issues with the basics; the Watch 5 Ultra did a great job mirroring notifications to my wrist, and the built-in speaker is quite good — you can make calls and even listen to music locally. Honor Health has a decent interface too, and it's easy to tweak settings via your phone.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ENhyAR9LcUYQdZ5XQMUNDU" name="Honor Watch 5 Ultra" alt="Honor Watch 5 Ultra next to Xiaomi 15 Ultra with Honor Health running" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ENhyAR9LcUYQdZ5XQMUNDU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The watch does a good job with activity monitoring as well; it has over 100 exercises, and delivers useful insights like VO2Max while running. In a similar vein, it tracks heart rate, blood oxygen and stress levels, and the data is pretty consistent. I didn't really see any issues with the accuracy of the activity or health monitoring, and while I didn't use the feature, the smartwatch can be used when diving up to 40m.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="McT5uUp8bUHb55fBYFZuAU" name="Honor Watch 5 Ultra" alt="Honor Watch 5 Ultra's settings page" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/McT5uUp8bUHb55fBYFZuAU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Although the software is pretty basic, the battery life is anything but — the Watch 5 Ultra easily managed to last over two weeks without any issues. With the always-on mode enabled alongside continuous heart rate monitoring, I got a week's worth of use, which is a terrific showing. The best part is that you can use any Qi charging mat to charge the smartwatch; Honor bundles a custom charger, but it has standard Qi as well, and this makes it highly convenient on the go.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8APYDou86PbRpPyVNy82AU" name="Honor Watch 5 Ultra" alt="Honor Watch 5 Ultra against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8APYDou86PbRpPyVNy82AU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Overall, the Watch 5 Ultra definitely has a lot going for it. The styling combined with the titanium-backed chassis allows it to stand out, and the 1.5-inch AMOLED panel is one of the best you'll see in this category. It does a great job with activity and health monitoring, and while you don't get all the software extras, the battery life is a major bonus over other Android smartwatches. It is on the costlier side when you consider the feature-set, but if you want a bigger smartwatch that excels at the basics, the Watch 5 Ultra has you covered.</p>

<ul><li>Google announced today that it will be integrating Gemini's multimodal capabilities into AI Mode on Google Search.</li><li>This will help expand Search's capabilities by answering comprehensive questions in one go.</li><li>Google Search's AI Mode becomes available to more "Labs" users in the U.S.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/search/ai-mode-multimodal-search/">announced</a> today that it will give<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-tests-experimental-ai-mode"> AI Mode</a> on Google Search more powers to perform its tasks. In a press release the company said that it is expanding its Gemini Capabilities to AI Mode on Google search, with the help of Google Lens.</p><p>"This experience brings together powerful visual search capabilities in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-lens">Google Lens </a>with a custom version of Gemini, so you can easily ask complex questions about what you see," Google stated.</p><p>It allows users who have access to AI Mode to be able to snap a photo or record a video and ask the chatbot a comprehensive question about what they see. For instance, users can ask exploratory and open-ended questions in AI mode, along with more complicated tasks — "like comparing two products, exploring how-tos or planning a trip," the Keyword added.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MXBH2Hn49YAQcsTHszYWxF" name="AI-Mode-Google-Search-Lens" alt="AI-mode-multimodal" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MXBH2Hn49YAQcsTHszYWxF.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="400" height="225" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>AI Mode gets this ability from Gemini’s multimodal capabilities. The tech giant added that once this mode is enabled, it can understand every scene in an image, including the different materials, colors or shapes, and arrangements of multiple objects, as seen in the gif above. For example, AI mode is able to read the titles of the books, capture the theme and commonalities of these books, and suggest similar high-rated books to the user.</p><p>It uses a “query fan-out” technique, just like the text-based search option and AI Mode, then issues multiple queries about the image as a whole and the objects within the image. It is important to note that AI Mode will be made available on both mobile and desktop search versions. However, it remains unclear if it's the same for the Lens feature, as the gif shows only a phone using this new capability.</p>

<p>That said, Google started testing the AI Mode only last month and has since received positive feedback from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One</a> AI Premium subscribers who were able to try it out. Users felt that AI Mode was able to quickly answer their complex and nuanced questions and also gave them a lot more information about a certain topic than a general Google Search.</p><p>Lastly, Google added that it's constantly testing to improve AI Mode based on feedback that comes from users in "Labs." AI Mode is now available on both Android and iOS via the Google app for those with a Google One AI Premium subscription.</p>

<ul><li>Gemini Live's new features are arriving on the Pixel 9 and Galaxy S25 series starting today.</li><li>The live video streaming and screen sharing features can be unlocked with a Gemini Advanced subscription.</li><li>These features will expand to all Gemini Advanced users on more Android devices in the future.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google's slow rollout of Gemini Live's new video streaming and screen sharing features is now reaching all users of the newest Google and Samsung smartphones. Starting today, April 7, owners of the Pixel 9 and Galaxy S25 series can use the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini Live</a> features with a Gemini Advanced subscription. The company announced the expanded availability in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-live-android-tips/" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p><p>Although the tools are starting on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a> lineups, they'll later be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-lives-new-video-streaming-and-screen-sharing-to-work-on-any-android-device">available on any Android device</a> that can run the Gemini app. In theory, that means Gemini Live with video streaming and screen sharing should work on Android phone, tablet, or foldable running Android 10.0 or higher.</p><p>The big requirement is the Gemini Advanced subscription, which is available through the Google One AI Premium plan for $20 per month.</p><p>With the new features, users will see two buttons added to the Gemini Live user-interface following the update. There's a camera icon on the left that starts a live video stream, and the stream supports both the front and rear cameras. The button to the right of it is for screen sharing, which only supports sharing the entire screen.</p>

<p>Google provides a few examples of how Gemini Live's live video capabilities can be used, such as for help organizing a drawer or fixing a record player.</p>

<p>For the screen sharing function, Google suggests using Gemini Live to help shop for a particular outfit online. Or, you could use Gemini Live as an extra set of eyes proofreading your work.</p><p>These features are available now for Gemini Advanced subscribers on Pixel 9 or Galaxy S25 hardware, and will roll out to more Android devices in the future.</p>

<p><em><strong>A lot of people ask:</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>I need to buy a new phone and a particular model caught my eye. Should I buy it or not?</strong></em></p>
<p>A variation of this question is the one I get most often. There are so many phones to choose from, some are obviously going to be better than others, and there is the whole value proposition to look at; you don't want to spend more than you need to or spend it on the wrong thing.</p><p>This question is also one that's impossible for someone else to answer. Good thing it's easy for <em>you</em> to answer, provided you take a bit and consider all you options.</p>
<p>I know, I know, this sounds like a cop-out or a non-answer to a legitimate question. I promise it's not. I have spent more hours than I can count dealing with all aspects of technology and have a good idea of what is good and what isn't, but I don't know what you need and can never know what you want unless you tell me.</p><p>Part of the answer is easier to answer because there are some phones you just shouldn't buy if you need something reliable. If it's made by a company nobody has ever heard of or one we've heard a lot of bad things about, don't consider it. Likewise, read what people who did buy one have to say; if everyone hates it, skip it.</p>

<p>I also tell everyone that being an early adopter often means you end up with a lemon. Never buy the first generation of any new technology if you need something you can depend on; let the people who want one for fun have the first dance. Gen one foldables and their janky busted screens fit nicely here. A few generations later, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">they're fine, dependable products</a>.</p><p>That leaves what you <em>should</em> buy. And here's where you have to answer your own question.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-need-versus-what-you-want-versus-what-you-can-afford-2">What you need versus what you want versus what you can afford</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="tvVexUZxsDbhWduioNC7v4" name="google-pixel-8a-back-bay-10.jpg" alt="The back of the Bay blue Google Pixel 8a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tvVexUZxsDbhWduioNC7v4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Once you know these three things, your choices will be narrowed down quite a bit. the trick is being truthful to yourself so you make the right decision.</p><p>I (technically, my wife) was in this situation not too long ago. She needed a phone and she needed it now. She also needed it to be reliable enough to use every day all day, and we didn't have a mountain of money to spend at the time. She decided on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/should-you-buy-pixel-8a">Pixel 8a</a>, and I thought that was a smart decision. It's not fancy, it <em>is</em> reliable, and the price was right.</p>
<p>Of course, she <em>wanted</em> more; something a little more fancy or a little more high-end would have made her happy. But knowing what was needed (a basic, reliable phone with acceptable battery life) and what was priced right (we got a great deal thanks to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-fi">Google Fi</a> promotion) helped me make the right decision. We can put a few dollars back and get <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">something she wants</a> later.</p><p>This was a phone emergency, replacing something that was damaged beyond repair.</p>
<p>You have to do the same thing. Something like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-a-series-buyers-guide">Galaxy A phone</a> or a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-hands-on">Pixel A</a> phone might be a good fit at the right price. Maybe you need to step down and buy an ultra-budget phone (or you just want to save money because you're frugal like that). Or maybe you can splurge and get the latest from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">OnePlus</a>.</p><p>The point is that only you really know the answer here. Make sure whatever you buy is exactly what you need, with as much of what you want and can afford thrown in.</p>

<ul><li>OnePlus president Louis Lee teased what will replace the Alert Slider on the 13T: the new "shortcut key."</li><li>The key is said to be "very practical" while also paying homage to the Alert Slider by including various notification modes.</li><li>The 13T was previously teased to arrive with a 6.3-inch flat display and (potentially) a 6,000mAh battery when it launches later in April.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>OnePlus is continuing to tease its next smartphone launch by giving users some early details about a new feature.</p><p>Over the weekend, OnePlus president <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/7582893032/Pm85QiJQd?pagetype=profilefeed">Louis Lee teased</a> what consumers can expect from the OnePlus 13 Mini, otherwise known as the OnePlus 13T (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/04/07/oneplus-13t-alert-slider-button-flat-display-teaser/">9to5Google</a>). In a post on Weibo, Lee stated the OnePlus 13T had been "upgraded;" however, this change will see the company's famous <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-alert-slider">Alert Slider</a> disappear (once again), replaced by a "shortcut key."</p><p>Lee didn't get too descriptive about this new physical button, but he mentions (machine-translated) the shortcut key lets users "easily switch between options in a series of operations, which is very practical." The shortcut key pays tribute to the Alert Slider by supporting different notification modes: silent, vibrating, and ringing. There is more to this new button, which Lee states will be revealed "at a later date."</p><p>Meanwhile, Lee builds hype for the OnePlus 13T's display. The post highlights OnePlus user feedback by stating it questioned users who enjoy small-screen phones. The information received reportedly influenced the Chinese OEM's decision behind the 13T's small, flat display. Lee claims, "Everyone who has used it likes it very much."</p>

<p>You could say the Alert Slider is an iconic part of the OnePlus design, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-wants-to-change-alert-slider-and-fans-arent-having-it">many others may agree with you</a>. The OEM's CEO, Pete Lau, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-to-ditch-alert-slider-in-favor-of-new-button">announced</a> in March that it was moving away from the button, opting for a new option that's more personalized. There was quite an uproar on the company's official forums from long-time users who've come to love the unique piece of utility. However, OnePlus seems to feel otherwise as Lau stated the new button (shortcut key) is “incredibly intuitive” and “future-ready.”</p><p>While Lau expressed love for the Alert Slider, there were also concerns that it would eventually be reduced to "minimal functionality." The Alert Slider is reportedly non-reprogrammable due to certain limitations.</p><p>In other news, April held a few <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-exec-teases-the-oneplus-13t-will-be-a-tiny-phone-with-a-big-battery">teasers from a OnePlus exec</a> who stated the 13T will feature a 6.3-inch display with a large battery. Nothing's confirmed; however, it's been rumored that the phone could sport a 6,000mAh battery, similar to its flagship sibling. Moreover, that could be boosted further by 80W wired fast charging, at least according to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/the-oneplus-13t-just-inched-closer-to-launch-with-fresh-details-surfacing">regulatory listing</a>.</p><p>The OnePlus 13T is expected to launch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-teases-its-upcoming-13t-as-a-part-of-an-april-fools-prank">later in April</a> with a rumored price tag anywhere from $600-$900.</p>

<hr>
<p>WhatsApp has announced that it will allow users to create their own avatars with the help of Meta AI to make the messaging platform more engaging.</p><p>After the update, users can head over to the Meta AI assistant on the messaging platform and use "imagine" prompts to create their new avatars, which the company terms as upgraded avatars.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="C6ARk5Bk9yvMQESZx6UamM" name="whatsapp-upgraded-avatars" alt="WhatsApp Meta AI upgraded avatars" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C6ARk5Bk9yvMQESZx6UamM.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WhatsApp)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For instance, as shown in the video, interested users can create AI avatars with prompts like "imagine me in a professional headshot" or some other similar prompts indicating to change your hair or outfit, per your preference. It appears Meta AI is able to create some accurate avatars, which are worth sharing and on the whole it seems to be a fun tool to play around with.</p><p>The company has been testing the upgraded AI avatar feature for quite a while now. The feature was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-could-soon-let-users-create-ai-images-of-themselves">first spotted</a> in testing back in 2024. Users have to bear in mind that these new ones notably differ from what we are used to, the avatars that can be found in Avatar settings in WhatsApp preferences.</p>

<p>There is another new, notable ability on the messaging platform and has been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/add-music-to-your-whatsapp-status">rolled out</a> more recently. Users who often share WhatsApp Status updates will be able to do so by adding some music from artists. It is pretty similar to the feature widely popular on Instagram Stories.</p><p>Before hitting the share status option, users would be able to add music by tapping the 'music note' icon at the top and searching/selecting a song that is likely to go along with the photo/video that they want to share.</p>

<ul><li>Amazon highlighted the start of its newest AI test, "Buy for Me."</li><li>The feature will be present to a limited group of U.S. customers in the search results when looking up products.</li><li>The Buy for Me AI will purchase a user's desired product from a given brand's website specifically, delivering your name, address, and payment info on its own.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Amazon's newest AI-based feature enters testing to put users on the fast track when purchasing products from other websites.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-shopping-app-buy-for-me-brands">blog post</a>, Amazon states it has kickstarted a test for its new "Buy for Me" shopping experience on Android and iOS for a "subset of U.S. customers." To sum it up, the company says Buy for Me leverages its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/">Bedrock AI software</a>, which provides "agentic capabilities." It's because of this that the feature can handle the entire task, from beginning to end, without user interference after the command.</p><p>To get started, those with access to the feature will notice it when viewing the "Shop brand sited directly" category in the search results. Tapping such an item will produce a page of product details. Afterward, Amazon states users can tap "Buy for Me" to request the company's AI to purchase the item from that other brand's website directly.</p><p>Amazon's shopping director, Oliver Messenger, said, "We’re always working to invent new ways to make shopping even more convenient, and we’ve created Buy For Me to help customers quickly and easily find and buy products from other brand stores if we don’t currently sell those items in our store."</p><p>Users will find the agentic capabilities of Buy for Me take over by "securely providing" your information: name, address, and payment. The company stresses that it does not have access to what you've previously purchased on another website.</p>

<p>Once completed, Amazon states customers will receive a confirmation email from the brand (website) its AI made the purchase from. However, you will be able to track is whereabouts from "Your Orders" in the Buy for Me Tab in Amazon's Shopping app. If anything goes wrong, like you're unsatisfied with the order and would like to return it, the post states users will have the ability to contact the brand's customer service.</p><p>While the test starts in the U.S. for a limited group of customers, Amazon says brand stores and products are also limited. It adds that there are plans to "incorporate more" brands and products alongside wider availability of the Buy for Me test.</p><p>Amazon continues to plug more AI into its shopping experience after it debuted its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/amazon-rufus-beta-rollout">Gen AI assistant, Rufus</a>. The AI is a conversational tool customers can utilize while shopping as it's trained with product information and the ability to answer a person's queries. Moreover, Rufus can make product recommendations and help you find new items when shopping.</p>

<ul><li>Google has launched a fun interface for all those Pokémon fanatics out there, to relive their childhood.</li><li>The fun animation pops up when users search for a Pokémon, and they're prompted by a Pokéball to catch it.</li><li>Google even provides hints for this Pokémon hunt, so the user can catch 151 first generation Pokémon.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google comes up with fun ways to interact with its users. Be it through Google Doodles or fun puzzles to make Google Search less redundant. This time, the tech giant is taking the Easter egg hunt to another level.</p><p>It looks like a collaboration between Google and the Pokémon Company that allows users to "catch" 151 first generation Pokémon and then add it to their Pokédex within their Google search profile.</p><p>To participate in this hunt, users must sign in to their Google account and look for the first Pokémon that pops into their heads. Then, a Pokéball appears at the bottom right corner of their screens. When tapped, it will attempt to catch the Pokémon in question.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:201.50%;"><img id="u58G2zvc2rphyE4QoTZXNf" name="Pokemon-hunt-google-search" alt="Attempting to catch Onix" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/u58G2zvc2rphyE4QoTZXNf.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="400" height="806" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Once the Pokémon is caught, the user will be prompted to continue searching for the rest of them with a hint to each Pokémon in the list.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon/553132/google-pokemon-pokedex-easter-egg-secret">Polygon</a>, Google sent them a news release stating that a  Legendary or Mythical Pokémon will require Master Balls to catch, which can be earned by catching regular Pokémon. For instance, once you catch the first 20 Pokémon, you'll be given a Master Ball with a hint for the legendary Pokémon.</p><p>At each checkpoint, you can only capture the specific legendary Pokémon that corresponds to the silhouette that Google shows you. Any attempt to catch a different legendary Pokémon will cause the Poké ball to open, and users will lose the Pokémon.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5712px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fvAvBV7GJ7nKJkFrLXMf98" name="Pokemon-hunt-google-search" alt="Pokémon in Google Search" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fvAvBV7GJ7nKJkFrLXMf98.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5712" height="3213" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The publication further adds that Google didn't cite any reward for the person who catches em' all. However, it did note that “searches for ‘Pokemon card’ reached an all-time high in the US” this February.</p><p>Still, it's probably just a fun interface to bring back nostalgic memories for some, while the satisfaction of catching all the Pokémon without running around the city for them.</p><p>It is important to note that Google's new Pokédex widget is only available on mobile and requires logging into a Google account to save your progress.</p><p>This isn't the first time that Google has tapped into nostalgia. Last year, for Easter, Search was turned into the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-search-retro-block-breaker-easter-egg" target="_blank">retro </a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-search-retro-block-breaker-easter-egg">"Block Breaker" game.</a> Like the original game, Breakout, users had a single paddle, one ball, and four rows of Google-colored bricks to break into.</p>

Although the Boom 4 came with a few improvements, including the addition of a USB-C port instead of a Micro-USB, the Boom 3 still boasts impressive audio quality, IP67 water and dust resistance, and a solid battery life. It's also easy to pair up with other Ultimate Ears speakers, in case you want to double up while the discount price is available or you already have another one.</p><p>This is also the lowest price this speaker has ever been, so it might be worth picking up if you don't mind the outdated micro-USB charging port.</p>

<hr>
<p>'Tis One UI 7 rollout day (Apr 7)! Samsung has kept its promise and begun rolling out the stable build for Galaxy S24 series, Galaxy Z Fold 6, and Z Flip 6 users in Korea and other regions.</p><p>According to Tarun Vats via his X post, Samsung has released the stable One UI 7 for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a> users first, who were already on the beta version in Korea. These are supposedly the build numbers for the trio-bearing F956NKSU2BYCK/ F956NOKR2BYCK/ F956NKSU2BYCG versions. Similarly, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> and Z Flip 6 users in the Korean region have also started getting the stable release.</p>

<p>The rollout seems to have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/tarunvats33/status/1909174186276159805">quickly reached</a> non-beta users too who are using the Galaxy S24 series with the S928NKSU4BYCG/ S928NOKR4BYCG/ S928NKSU4BYCG build numbers.

Although Samsung started releasing beta versions of One UI 7 for the Galaxy S24 series and the aforementioned foldables last year, the stable release has been delayed when compared to the previous iterations’ rollout.</p>

<p>The One UI 7 is a notable upgrade as it brings tons of new features, improvements, and more Galaxy AI innovation. The Galaxy S24 series was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-how-many-updates">promised</a> with seven years of OS upgrades, and this stable marks as the first one as they shipped with One UI 6 when launched last year.</p><p>While the Galaxy S24 series, Galaxy Z Fold 6, and Z Flip 6 are the first ones to get the stable One UI 7 starting in Korea, the predecessor models, including the S24 FE, are expected to be receiving it within the same month.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy A36 5G is a new entrant in the budget space and is the successor to the Galaxy A35 5G. The most notable upgrades include more years of OS upgrades, HDR video recording with the front camera, faster charging, and a brighter display. The A36 5G also has a more premium design, which makes it a solid phone to have on your  shopping list. For roughly $100 more though, there's also the Pixel 9a that's worth considering for its flagship-grade processor and software.</p><p>While the new Galaxy A56 5G is more of a direct competitor to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-hands-on">Pixel 9a</a>, that's coming later in the year whereas the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-launches-the-galaxy-a56-5g-a36-5g-and-a26-5g-with-awesome-intelligence">Galaxy A36 5G</a> can be bought right now, in the U.S.. Looking at the Samsung Galaxy A36 5G vs. Google Pixel 9a, should you spend that extra $100 for the Pixel or get the Samsung and spend that money on accessories? Let's find out.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-a36-vs-google-pixel-9a-design-and-display-2">Samsung Galaxy A36 vs. Google Pixel 9a: Design and display</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1062px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.31%;"><img id="x29TmvkFSEihfYMYfBi3Gb" name="samsung-galaxy-a36-5g-lifestyle-official-169.jpg" alt="Galaxy A36 5G lifestyle ad" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/x29TmvkFSEihfYMYfBi3Gb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1062" height="598" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung has tweaked the designs of the new A series once again, making them look more up-market than before. The Galaxy A36 5G features flat sides with curved portions for the button area and narrower bezels around the display compared to the older model. The camera bump design has changed from individual cutouts for the lenses to a singular vertical pill-shaped layout. The phone is available in two colors, Awesome Black and Awesome Lavender, the latter of which is the better shade in my opinion.</p><p>The Galaxy A36 is slimmer than the Pixel 9a at just 7.4mm, but it's heavier at 195 grams. I don't mind this since the A36 5G is one of the few budget phones to sport a glass back, and Gorilla Glass Victus Plus at that. This is the same scratch-resistant glass used over the massive 6.7-inch display. It's a Super AMOLED panel with a 120Hz refresh rate and a high peak brightness of up to 1,900 nits. The body of the phone is also IP67-rated for dust and water resistance.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="HqrWLy2Ro9cTHCgLrY4HcA" name="Google-Pixel-9a-iris-in-hand" alt="The Iris Google Pixel 9a held in hand, the photo taken downards to emphasize its color and size." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HqrWLy2Ro9cTHCgLrY4HcA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Pixel 9a has an interesting new design which will take some getting used to. It's lighter than the Samsung at 186 grams, but is thicker at 8.9mm. The back panel is plastic which is what contributes to the lower weight. The 9a does come in some cool pastel colors like Obsidian, Porcelain, Iris, and Peony. All those that hate rear camera bumps will love the Pixel 9a's design as the back is nearly all flat. You do get an aluminum frame though which is sturdier than the plastic frame on the Galaxy.</p><p>Despite being $100 more, the Pixel 9a's display looks more of the budget variety than the A36, mainly due to the thick bezels. Scratch protection is not the best either as it uses the much older Gorilla Glass 3 protection. The display is pOLED though, with a 120Hz refresh rate and up to 2,700 nits of peak brightness. The size of the display is smaller than the Samsung A36, which is not ideal for media consumption but it is a lot more pocketable. Google has kicked it up a notch with weather resistance as the Pixel 9a now gets an IP68 rating, just like most flagships.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:720px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fBis82cK9vYnAaS27WKZ3V" name="samsung-galaxy-a36-5g-official-battery-ad-169.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy A36 5G in front of battery shape segmented into lifestyle images" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fBis82cK9vYnAaS27WKZ3V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="720" height="405" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung has launched just one variant of the Galaxy A36 5G in the U.S. with 6GB RAM and 128GB storage for $399.99. Other regions will have more variants like 8GB RAM and up to 256GB of storage. The 6GB of RAM is a bit concerning considering this phone will be supported for the next six years. Powering the A36 5G is a Snapdragon 6 Gen 3 chip, which is presumably a small step down from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-announces-snapdragon-6s-gen-3">Snapdragon 6s Gen 3</a>, which was not too different from the Gen 1 chip from 2021. It's a strictly mid-tier processor, so you can expect similar performance, which is to say, decent multitasking and casual gaming but not much else.</p><p>The Pixel 9a on the other hand uses the Tensor G4 SoC, which is also found in Google's flagship phone range. While it's no match for Qualcomm's best, it will certainly be better than the processor in the A36 5G. This makes the Pixel 9a better suited for gaming and heavier workloads. The 9a starts at $499 and goes on sale on April 10, 2025. It has 8GB RAM and two storage variants of 128GB and 256GB.</p>

<p>Samsung doesn't specify how long the Galaxy A36 5G will last but given the 5,000mAh capacity and mid-range chip, you should expect at least a day and a half, if not more, on one charge. A lot of it will also depend on the types of apps you use and how many run in the background. Charging is fairly quick thanks to 45W wired charging speeds, which is something we haven't seen before for this series. The charger will have to be bought separately though. Wireless charging is missing, which I don't think many would care about at this price.</p><p>The Galaxy A36 5G features a 50MP main, 8MP ultrawide, and a 5MP macro camera. There's a 12MP camera on the front. Compared to the previous model, the A36 can now shoot 4K HDR video with the front camera as well. We've yet to test the Galaxy A36 so it's hard to say how good or bad the cameras will be, other than they should do just fine for your Instagram posts.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2176px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ekcYdE9agPmm82HBkVrasA" name="google-pixel-9a-official-ad-1-169.png" alt="Google Pixel 9a cover variants" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ekcYdE9agPmm82HBkVrasA.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2176" height="1224" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Pixel 9a comes with an equally large battery of 5,100mAh, which again, should easily offer multi-day battery life. This is the largest battery we've had yet on any Pixel. Charging speed is much slower though, at just 23W with Google's 45W adapter. As a consolation, you do get wireless charging at 7.5W if you're a fan of this technology.</p><p>Cameras is one area where the Pixel 9a will no doubt dominate. The 9a has a 48MP main and a 13MP ultrawide on the back, and a 13MP module in the front. Just like the Samsung, the 9a can also shoot 4K with the front and rear cameras. It might not have a macro camera, but it supports features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-use-macro-focus-on-pixel-7-pro">Macro Focus.</a></p>

<p>Both phones are pretty evenly matched in terms of software support and features. The Galaxy A36 5G ships with One UI 7 which is based on Android 15, and will be getting six generations of OS upgrades and six years of security patches. This is the first time Samsung has pledged such as long-term support for its A series phones. The A36 5G also gets some AI features from the flagships like Circle to Search and Enhanced Object Eraser, but not the full roster. To differentiate this AI suite from the S series, Samsung is calling it "Awesome Intelligence" instead of Galaxy AI.</p><p>The Google Pixel 9a has the same software as every other Pixel 9 series and that's great, because you get all the AI features from the more expensive models. The 9a will also be getting seven years of OS and security upgrades, which is more than the Galaxy. However, Google already has an expiration date in mind, which means the 9a will get whatever Android version was launched before that. The A36 on the other hand has been promised six "generations" of updates, so depending on how Google plans its future Android releases, the Galaxy might just end up getting the same number of Android versions as the Pixel.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-a36-vs-google-pixel-9a-which-one-offers-better-value-2">Samsung Galaxy A36 vs. Google Pixel 9a: Which one offers better value?</h2>
<p>It's actually a lot tougher to pick a single winner here since they both deliver incredible value at their price points. At $400, the Samsung Galaxy A36 5G is easily one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best cheap Android phones</a>. It offers similar features as the Pixel 9a and does a few better like the 45W charging, a slimmer design, and a more scratch-resistant screen. You're not really missing out on much other than maybe gaming performance, limited storage, and no wireless charging.</p><p>The Pixel 9a starts at $100 more, but offers a more robust IP rating, a brighter display, a more compact body, a lighter design, wireless charging, and a more potent processor. It also has more AI tricks than the Galaxy and an extra year of updates.</p><p>If you happen to find both at a similar price at some point during sales, I'd pick the Google Pixel 9a in a heartbeat.

Maybe you are holding onto an older model <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Google Pixel Watch 2</a> or even still sporting the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-review">Google Pixel Watch</a>. As you explore everything it can do, you have probably looked into ways to make it personalized as well. This might include choosing a cool watch face and adjusting the view of apps, which can be organized in either a list or grid view.</p><p>With a list, you’ll see the alphabetized names of each app line by line. Scroll up and down to find and select the one you want. With grid view, the apps create an icon formation on the screen, displaying three in a row. Scroll through and you can find and select the one you want based on recognition of the symbol. But how do you switch this view? It’s super simple.</p>

<p>1. From the main watch face, tap the <strong>side Crown</strong>.</p><p>2. When the App List opens, <strong>scroll</strong> all the way to the bottom.</p>

<p>4. The apps now appear in the Grid View.</p>

<p>Note that alternatively, you can also swipe up from the top of the home screen to open Settings. Select General, App View, and switch to Grid View from there.</p><p>Many people prefer the grid view since quite frankly, it looks cooler. And once you’re familiar with your apps and the usually easily identifiable icons, you’ll love this view. If you find, however, that it looks too cluttered after you download more and more apps, you can switch back to List View at any time using the same steps.</p><p>Switching from List to Grid View and vice versa works, it should be noted, on all three Pixel Watch models to date, including the original Google Pixel Watch, the Google Pixel Watch 2, and the latest Google Pixel Watch 3, one of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">the best Android smartwatches</a> on the market today. You just need to make sure you’re running wearOS 5.0.</p>

<p>Garmin recently refreshed both its Instinct and Fenix product lines with new offerings, and they've immediately become two of the best long-lasting sports and adventure watches available. The Garmin Instinct 3 and Fenix 8 can be found in multiple case sizes and AMOLED or MIP/Solar configurations, so there's almost certainly a style that meets your needs between them.</p><p>When considering the Instinct 3 or Fenix 8, the decision comes down to a single question: is the Fenix 8 worth double the price of the Instinct 3? On paper, the premium <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Garmin Fenix 8</a> handily outdoes the midrange <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-cant-decide-if-the-garmin-instinct-3-is-a-triumph-or-a-letdown">Garmin Instinct 3</a>, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's the better value. Let's break down exactly how these two <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">great Garmin smartwatches</a> compare, and who they're each made for.</p>
<h2 id="garmin-instinct-3-vs-fenix-8-design-and-display-2">Garmin Instinct 3 vs. Fenix 8: Design and display</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ZZBTbeicHteBzFibiwPv8X" name="IMG_9788" alt="A Walking activity on the Garmin Instinct 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZZBTbeicHteBzFibiwPv8X.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Garmin Instinct 3 and Fenix 8 are both rugged watches built for the outdoors, but the latter features a more premium design. The Instinct 3 uses a mix of fiber-reinforced polymer and aluminum, giving it a softer, rubber or silicone-like texture. Meanwhile, the Fenix 8 uses a steel or titanium construction with Gorilla Glass or sapphire cover glass.</p><p>Both watches have a 10ATM water-resistance rating, with the Fenix 8 taking that a step further with dive capabilities and a MIL-STD-810H certification — a military-grade durability standard. As a result, the Fenix 8 is heavier, with the steel variant weighing 74 grams and the titanium option weighing 64 grams. The Instinct 3 weighs just 59 grams by comparison.</p>

<p>Garmin ships the Instinct 3 and Fenix 8 with silicone bands by default, but they each can be configured with nylon and leather straps instead. The Fenix 8 also has a metal band option available, which could dress the steel or titanium chassis up for special occasions.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="RCxiWbRBqe4ySWPAXTcZsW" name="IMG_9791" alt="A left-side view of the Garmin Instinct 3's three buttons" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RCxiWbRBqe4ySWPAXTcZsW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Garmin Fenix 8 is available in more case sizes, starting at 43mm and topping out at 51mm. There's also a 47mm configuration right in the middle. Garmin sells the Instinct 3 in two size options: 45mm and 50mm. You'll see a 43mm Instinct watch on Garmin's website, but that's the Instinct E, a cheaper watch with a completely different feature set.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="eJdCTaTDPe9awCzVhgfudX" name="Garmin-Fenix-8-side-view" alt="A close-up side view of the Garmin Fenix 8 with the default watch face" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eJdCTaTDPe9awCzVhgfudX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Garmin's Fenix 8 has better hardware and more software features than the Instinct 3, full stop. It starts with the display, where the Fenix 8 uses a 1.3-inch or 1.4-inch AMOLED panel compared to the Instinct 3's 1.2-inch AMOLED panel. As previously mentioned, there are MIP options that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitness-watches-mip-to-amoled-transition-long-overdue">tend to look worse than AMOLED and are less responsive</a>, but offer longer, "unlimited" battery life with solar charging.</p><p>We don't know which processor powers the Fenix 8, but the Instinct 3 is powered by the ARM Cortex M4. The Instinct 3's lowly processor, paired with its comical 17MB of RAM and up to 4GB of onboard storage, is the reason why it doesn't support many software features. It can't save offline maps, and you may find yourself needing to delete or offload saved workouts just to install updates because the storage threshold is so tight.</p>

<p>The Fenix 8 gives you a lot more to work with, featuring 1GB of memory and 32GB of storage. That's plenty to store workouts, offline maps, music, and more. It also has Wi-Fi support, but otherwise matches the Instinct 3 in terms of connectivity. Both watches support Bluetooth, ANT+, NFC for Garmin Pay, and multi-band GPS.</p><p>The differences start to come in the hardware health sensors, starting with the heart rate sensor. The Instinct 3 uses the same, older sensor as the Instinct 3. The Garmin Fenix 8 is equipped with the latest Garmin Elevate v5 sensor, which is more accurate and adds an ECG function. For what it's worth, while the Elevate v5 sensor is more consistent, our reviewer found the Instinct 3 reaches the same average BPM as a good armband monitor.</p><p>Plus, GPS accuracy is on par with the Fenix 8, so not everything on the Instinct 3 is a downgrade. With that being said, the Fenix 8 just has <em>so many more</em> software features, including a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/rucking-workout-fad-is-fun-novelty-but-not-for-everyone"><u>rucking mode,</u></a> offline maps, estimated hydration and electrolyte loss widgets, dive capabilities, ski maps, strength training tools, and the fully featured Garmin Coach.</p><p>It's impossible to ignore the fact that the majority of Fenix 8 features are available on the  <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Garmin Forerunner 965</a>, which isn't as rugged as the Instinct 3 but still offers up to 23 days of battery life.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="6yCzpWUu8vnDcukBcpqwDM" name="Garmin-Instinct-3-vs-2X-vs-2-rocks-close-up" alt="The Garmin Instinct 3 AMOLED, Instinct 2X Solar, and Instinct 2 Solar sitting on rocks next to one another." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6yCzpWUu8vnDcukBcpqwDM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Arguably, the only reason the Garmin Instinct 3 can challenge the Fenix 8 is due to the AMOLED upgrade this year. It's still not a touchscreen, so you'll need to fiddle with clunky buttons to navigate Garmin OS at times. However, the screen is beautiful and bright, and fun color combinations help the Instinct 3 add to its sporty look. With plenty of health sensors and basic Garmin training features, the Instinct 3 does give you <em>almost</em> everything you need.</p><p>Certain things, like the lack of offline maps, GPX exports, and a touchscreen, are going to leave some adventurers wanting more. To get those features, you're looking at the $900 Enduro 3 or the $1,100 Fenix 8. As for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-has-underwhelmed-me-despite-how-great-it-is">whether the Garmin Fenix 8 is worth more</a> than double the price of the Instinct 3, that's for you to decide. If you're someone who regularly pounds the pavement or the trails, or is a multi-sport athlete, I could definitely see the appeal.</p><p>For most of us, the Instinct 3 is hands-down the better value. But if you have high training demands and a lot of cash, it's hard to look past the Fenix 8's enticing features.</p>

Even in 2025, there are still plenty of devices from Samsung, Google, and other brands that ship with 128GB of on-device storage or less. That's why it's important to stay on top of your storage usage, cleaning up old files as necessary.</p><p>Luckily, Android includes a few built-in storage management tools with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/files-by-google-has-a-new-pdf-viewer-and-its-ditching-google-drive">Files by Google app</a>. Using the Clean tool, Trash bin, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-files-removes-photos-backed-up-to-google-photos">Smart Storage features</a>, you can make sure you have plenty of space for all your apps, music, videos, and more.

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-use-the-clean-tool-to-free-up-space"><span>How to use the Clean tool to free up space</span></h3>
<p>The easiest and best way to quickly free up storage space on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> is to use the Clean tool. It's built into the Files by Google app, and will work on any device. Essentially, the Clean tool will scan your device for old files, photos, screenshots, and more that you might not need. Then, you can browse through the selections, deleting anything unnecessary to save space.</p><p>Here's how to use the Clean tool in the Files by Google app:</p>
<p>1. Open the <strong>Files by Google app</strong> and tap the <strong>three-button menu</strong>.</p><p>2. Press the <strong>Clean tab </strong>in the list.</p><p>3. Tap the <strong>Arrow</strong> <strong>icon</strong> beside your storage breakdown for a detailed look at what categories are taking up the most space.</p><p>4. Return to the <strong>Clean tab </strong>by swiping left and looking for suggested items to delete. Depending on your storage breakdown, you might see suggestions like <strong>Delete old screenshots</strong> or <strong>Delete junk files</strong>.</p><p>5. Select the <strong>files you want to delete</strong>. You can select them all, or select individual files, and press <strong>Move files to Trash</strong> when finished.</p>

<p>Smart Storage is a handy Pixel-exclusive feature that takes the hassle out of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-free-storage-space-android">manually deleting unnecessary photos</a>. When enabled, Smart Storage will "permanently delete media backed up to Google Photos that's been on your device for 60 days."

<p>1. Open the <strong>Files by Google app</strong> and tap the <strong>three-button menu</strong>.</p><p>2. Press the <strong>Settings tab </strong>in the list.</p><p>3. Flip the toggle beside <strong>Smart Storage</strong>.</p>

<p>Most people have likely found themselves needing to claw back megabytes or gigabytes of space on their phone at some point or another in crunch time. Maybe you really needed to download an app or take another video. Either way, many Android users don't think about storage until they run out.</p><p>However, the better solution is to keep an eye on your storage usage before it becomes a problem, regularly deleting unnecessary content. Things like photos, videos, and messages in particular can take up a surprising amount of on-device storage space. Whether you're using the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Google Pixel 9</a> or another Android smartphone, there are plenty of Files by Google features to help you clear space.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-132">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The Galaxy S25 Enterprise Edition gets eight years of major OS updates, outlasting the regular models’ seven years.</li><li>These business-focused models get Android updates all the way to Android 23, plus security patches until January 2032.</li><li>The S25 Enterprise Edition is loaded with the full Knox Suite for top-tier security and business tools like Knox Manage, Knox Capture, and Knox Remote Support.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung has confirmed that the Galaxy S25 Enterprise Edition is set to outlast the regular models when it comes to major OS updates.</p><p>After making its global debut in January, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> lineup got another boost in February. That’s when Samsung officially rolled out the Enterprise Editions of the Galaxy S25, S25 Plus, and the S25 Ultra.</p><p>Unlike the regular Galaxy S25 models that are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/7-years-of-updates-arent-what-you-think-they-are-and-samsung-just-proved-it">set for seven years of Android and security updates</a>, the Enterprise Edition takes things a step further. According to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsungknox.com/en/knox-platform/supported-devices/aer" target="_blank">Samsung Knox website</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s25-enterprise-edition-8-major-android-os-updates" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>), these business-focused versions are promised Android updates all the way to Android 23, marking a full eight years of major OS support.</p><p>These devices will also keep getting security patches all the way through January 2032, on top of those major Android upgrades.</p>
<h2 id="security-that-goes-the-distance-2">Security that goes the distance</h2>
<p>Built with businesses in mind, the Galaxy S25 Enterprise Edition comes loaded with the full Knox Suite. That means defense-grade security plus handy tools like Knox Manage for keeping devices in check, Knox Capture for smart data collection, and Knox Remote Support for quick IT help.</p><p>Thanks to Knox, these devices earn the “Android Enterprise Recommended” badge, meaning they’re built to handle long-term business use without breaking a sweat.</p><p>As a nice bonus, Samsung throws in a free one-year Knox Suite subscription with every Enterprise Edition device. You’re also getting Microsoft Office and Google Cloud preloaded, so it's ready to get down to business right out of the box.</p>
<h2 id="same-power-extra-muscle-2">Same power, extra muscle</h2>
<p>Under the hood, the Galaxy S25 Enterprise Edition packs the same punch as the regular models, including the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, 12GB of RAM, and more.</p><p>Furthermore, the Galaxy S25 Enterprise Edition comes loaded with smart AI tools like real-time call transcriptions with auto summaries and a Writing Assist feature to help polish your work emails.</p>

<p>While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">latest and greatest Samsung phones</a> have gone on sale worldwide, Samsung is taking a more selective route with the Enterprise Edition and rolling it out in just a handful of markets.</p><p>Samsung is no stranger to long-term support for its professional-grade devices, and the Enterprise Editions are keeping that tradition alive.</p><p>The fact that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a> Enterprise Edition had the same update timeline as the standard model makes the S25 Enterprise Edition’s eight-year support stand out even more.</p>

<p>Last year, I wrote about how I was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/why-im-done-with-heart-rate-monitor-chest-straps">done with heart rate monitor chest straps</a>, for both comfort and accuracy reasons. Cut to 2025, and I still don't find them especially comfortable to wear. But after testing the new Garmin HRM 200 against the Polar H10 and COROS HRM across multiple runs, I'm happy to admit that I was overly harsh on chest straps.</p><p>Garmin sent me the HRM 200 with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-cant-decide-if-the-garmin-instinct-3-is-a-triumph-or-a-letdown">Instinct 3</a>, which I've been testing for months. By contrast, I shoved Garmin's chest strap into a drawer and <del>subconsciously suppressed its existence</del>, <em>ahem</em>, forgot about it until this week.</p><p>The Garmin HRM 200, like any chest strap, cuts out the wrist-based optical middleman and directly reads your heart's electrical signals for better accuracy. It's water resistant, highly affordable at $79, and lasts about a year before you need to swap out the batteries.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, I found it uncomfortable. But it did outperform my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Garmin Fenix 8</a>'s Elevate v5 optical sensor for accuracy, for the sticklers who need near-perfect data. It's not standalone like the Garmin HRM-Pro, but otherwise, chest strap fans should love it.</p><p>I decided to test the Garmin HRM 200 and Polar H10 against each other — and against my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-heart-rate-monitor-review">COROS HRM armband</a> that I much prefer — and give chest straps another chance to impress me.</p>

<h2 id="my-simple-beef-with-chest-straps-2">My simple beef with chest straps</h2>
<p>Chest straps aren't kind to people with dadbods. The strap naturally digs into my skin at the fit necessary to keep a consistent, non-slip connection.</p><p>I've lost enough weight in the past year that this is less of an issue than before, but my real complaint is how a chest strap keeps me out of the "zone." It hugs my chest with every breath, reminding me that my performance is being monitored and judged at all times, and making me self-conscious if my breathing rate gets high.</p><p>But I acknowledge that my dislikes may not apply to you. I think I'm more hypersensitive to tight clothing — like ties or skinny jeans — than other people. Just because <em>I</em> don't like chest straps doesn't mean I can ignore them; it's my job to give them a fair shake.</p>

<p>My more fundamental Polar H10 issue was how it produced bizarrely erratic results across several runs in 2024, no matter how well I adjusted the fit or wet the contact sensors.</p><p>Eventually, I discovered that my Polar H10 only worked as intended when connected to a smartwatch. I was using the option to track workouts directly in the Polar Beat app, and for whatever reason, the wonky phone-strap Bluetooth connection would sub in deflated readings at odd moments that badly skewed the results.</p><p>Once I started syncing my Polar H10 to a watch, it became a reliable control group for my accuracy tests. But I remained a bit suspicious that chest straps were overhyped.</p><p>Now that I had <em>two</em> chest straps, I decided it was time to see just how consistent these devices are, and if the accuracy gap is worth the trade-offs.</p>

<p>My only way to compare all three straps' data was to wear three smartwatches — Garmin Fenix 8, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-pace-pro-review">COROS PACE Pro</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/polar-vantage-m3-gps-hr-accuracy-test">Polar Vantage M3</a> — connected to each, with the Garmin HRM 200 and Polar H10 stacked atop one another on my chest and the COROS optical sensor on my arm.</p><p>Aside from being a goofy-looking setup, I could only hope this close chest strap proximity wouldn't interfere with the results.</p>

<p>My hour-long, high-aerobic run started off shaky, with COROS' data elevated by about 30 bpm, Garmin taking a minute to catch up, and Polar having one early, random dip. But everything stabilized quickly, and there were no other issues for the remaining 58 minutes.</p><p>The chart above shows how all three devices compare, while the chart below focuses on the two chest straps. All three straps measured a 168 bpm average.</p>

<p>Typically, wrist-based optical sensors fall 1–3 bpm short in my tests, with a noticeable delay when I change my pace or climb hills. The COROS HRM still shows a bit of that lag, but it's minimal enough that only the most fussy of runners would notice.</p><p>As for the two chest straps, they're in near-lockstep for the majority of the run, which impressed me!</p><p>The bigger accuracy test, as always, was the track workout. I foolishly ran it the next morning when I was still tired, so I struggled to hit my usual max-HR levels. But I still got almost three miles of sprints, hard running, jogging, and walking, challenging my heart rate monitors to follow the rapid changes.</p>

<p>This time, there were noticeable gaps between the three devices. Both COROS and Polar lagged slightly behind Garmin's HR peaks and valleys instead of the two chest straps leaving the armband behind.</p><p>That doesn't mean Garmin's HRM 200 is more accurate, necessarily. The Polar H10 may have been slightly disadvantaged, placed beneath the HRM 200 so it wasn't as close to my heart. And I don't know if Garmin's <em>spikier</em> graph than Polar's steady one means it was faster at catching tiny HR fluctuations or was just slightly more inconsistent.</p><p>(<em>Note: </em>Ignore the Polar H10's one awkward flat-line near the end; it's a known issue where Polar's data freezes on the last HR result when you pause a workout. I tried to avoid pausing, but like I said, I was exhausted.)</p>

<p>Ultimately, the Garmin HRM 200 and COROS HRM both showed a 174 bpm average and 188 bpm maximum, while the Polar H10 fell 1 bpm short at 173 and 187, respectively. I'm happy to chalk that up to awkward chest placement, and it's <em>much</em> better than how my H10 performed in the past.</p><p>If I contrast that with every track workout test I've done with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness smartwatches</a>, some wrist-based optical sensors are better than others, but even the best will fall a few beats per minute short of the mark. I understand why people rely on specialized HRM straps for the best data.</p>

<p>I'm always happy to change my opinion when confronted with new information. After a week of dual chest straps and wearing multiple watches at once, I can state what most people would consider obvious: chest straps' data is more consistent than I gave them credit for.</p><p>But I'm <em>not</em> budging on the other part of my argument. Yes, the COROS HRM optical readings aren't as immediately responsive and accurate as the Garmin HRM 200 or Polar H10. But the gap is so <em>minimal</em>, and an armband vanishes from my consciousness after five minutes while a chest strap takes up mental real estate the entire time.</p><p>Basically, unless you truly need the best-possible accuracy, I'd point you towards a COROS HRM or Polar Verity Sense to improve on your watch's unreliable readings — and I hope Garmin considers an arm-based sensor of its own.</p><p>If you're not as hypersensitive to tight devices as I am, the Garmin HRM 200 is an excellent deal for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a> owners.</p>

There are too many bugs!!11!!!</em>"</p><p>I get it, and sometimes I feel that way, too. In fact, I care more about the software powering a product than the hardware, so it might even hit me a little harder. It seems like companies are getting worse and churning out products that are more buggy than ever.</p><p>They're not. You just know about them all, thanks to the information superhighway of the 'net.</p>
<p>It's good to be informed; there is no denying that. But sometimes, we can lose focus and fixate on the problems, even when we're not experiencing them. Whether it's old information <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixels-weather-widget-desync-old-forecasts-reported">on a weather widget</a>, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/some-galaxy-phone-screens-are-showing-a-nasty-green-line-after-an-update">magic green line</a> appearing on the screen after a software update, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">Bluetooth dropping</a> and then reconnecting every few minutes, you know all about it.</p><p>It has always been this way. There was a time before Reddit, before every tech website on the internet (including this one) rushed to write an article about a software bug, and phones still had them — lots and lots of them. Coming from BlackBerry, I <em>know</em> what lots of bugs look like.</p>

<p>This isn't a brand or operating system issue, either, because they all are like this. The iPhone and iOS are filled with bugs, just like Google's own Pixel phones are. Android on your Samsung or OnePlus phone is filled with bugs. Windows Phone was filled with bugs. Even Palm and Nokia phones were a mess.</p><p>You either didn't care or (more likely) you only knew about the ones you noticed. I've been writing about tech for a long time, so I probably get extra exposure to these issues, but I can tell you that there are plenty of reported and verified problems that I've never been able to see for myself.</p>
<p>This is the new normal. It's not even a bad thing. It can become a bad thing when unhelpful people who might be endeared to a particular brand a little too much chime in with things like <em>"I don't have the problem, so it must be user error, or you probably just need to restart your phone,</em>" nonsense that inevitably pops up in places like Reddit or article comments and forums.</p><p>It's important to know about potential problems, though. For instance, if you have a Pixel, you should <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-users-late-start-alarm-issues-reported" target="_blank">install a different alarm clock</a>. Do it before things happen.</p><p>We want to think of this as a new phenomenon. It's as if phone makers are purposefully releasing products early, knowing that the software is still a wreck, and they don't care. Just ship it!</p><p>That's probably partially true, but it has always been true. You probably never had the displeasure of using a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/goodbye-blackberry">BlackBerry Storm</a>, but it was rushed to market when the first iPhone came out, and RIM (the company that was BlackBerry) eventually admitted to it. They wanted a big touchscreen phone on the market and did not care that it sucked.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="ukcG9WrVnudWXbkA7b9wQi" name="USB-debugging-generic.jpg" alt="Using adb" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ukcG9WrVnudWXbkA7b9wQi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That's just one example from the past, but there are plenty more from every phone maker. Most of the time, they eventually get it right; you just get to use an unfinished product for six months or so.</p><p>It's always going to be this way. Apple rushed its AI suite before it was ready. Samsung is doing everything it can to push <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/one-ui-7-update-comes-to-galaxy-phones-on-april-10-in-us">One UI 7</a> out and will "allow" more bugs than we want to make it happen. Google needs a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">refresher on processor throttling and power management</a> if it wants to keep designing chips.</p><p>We love to hate it, and sometimes hate to love it. But we need to get used to it. This isn't just a phone problem — everything you buy with a battery and a microprocessor is this way and will always be this way. And Reddit will have every person affected talking about it for you to read.</p>

And I'm basking in this sudden new trend of open-source watches as the big-name brands trend toward subscriptions.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/unawatch/meet-una-the-modular-gps-sports-watch/description" target="_blank"><strong>UNA Watch Kickstarter</strong></a> lists out its features: continuous heart rate, blood oxygen, steps, and floors climbed in normal settings, plus fitness features like HR zones, pace, laps, and (after launch) downloadable GPX routes. It has dual-frequency GPS and 10-day battery life.</p><p>Interestingly, it runs on the same Cortex-M33 coprocessor found in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a>, only without the battery-guzzling Snapdragon.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:695px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="z79C4GMKNGhbyPUSBXujiK" name="UNA-Watch-with-app" alt="The UNA Watch on a wrist while the person's other hand holds an iPhone, showing a companion app with fitness data." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/z79C4GMKNGhbyPUSBXujiK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="695" height="391" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: UNA)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I appreciate that the UNA Watch charges with a simple USB-C slot <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wearable-charging-is-an-unsolvable-mess">instead of a proprietary cable</a> and that you'll be able to buy modular upgrades like music storage or a mic/speaker combo and install them yourself. It also won't have any subscription.</p><p>You can even buy the dev tool for an extra $40 to add your own apps and firmware!</p><p>Pebble is much less fitness-focused, making UNA a better fit for my lifestyle. However, both share an open-source, enthusiast philosophy where people can code their own apps or add their own sensors as needed. In theory, the community will build up the UNA Watch's limited feature set — just as Pebble asked its community for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ericmigi.com/blog/how-to-help-build-open-source-pebble-software">help developing new software</a>.</p><p>My limited coding background makes it unlikely that I can help either community. But smartwatch brands have moved away from letting indie devs into their closed systems, to everyone's detriment. That's why devices like UNA and Pebble are so important and have me excited to buy into their communities.</p>
<h2 id="una-and-pebble-are-fighting-against-the-tide-2">UNA and Pebble are fighting against the tide</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2037px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="8UnRaxseeEikjEUVcfHW9K" name="pebble-core-duo-2-time-2-smartwatches-hero" alt="A rendering depicting Core Devices' new PebbleOS smartwatches: the Core 2 Duo and the Time 2." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8UnRaxseeEikjEUVcfHW9K.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2037" height="1146" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Core Devices)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I've reviewed almost every mainstream smartwatch brand out there today, and it feels like they're all starting to converge on the same priorities.</p><p>Some wearable brands are honing in on offering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/were-entering-the-medical-era-of-wearables">medical-grade health tracking</a> and adding new data points like blood pressure and glucose. Others, like Garmin, are going all-in on AI as a pretense to charge more for premium features with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-connect-plus-in-depth-hands-on-much-more-than-an-ai-unfortunately">Connect Plus subscription</a>.</p><p>Basically, we're entering the heavyweight era of smartwatches, where brands bring in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-interview-dr-jacqueline-shreibati-on-pixel-watch-loss-of-pulse-and-ai-diagnoses">doctors for more accurate data</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/gemini-on-wear-os-will-be-much-needed-but-tricky-upgrade-for-assistant">squeeze LLMs onto your wrist</a>. And while that's exciting in its way, it doesn't leave much room for experimentation — for smaller brands, tiny teams, or indie devs to try something new — because every watch needs a laundry list of features to compete.</p><p>Part of that is Apple's fault. I've previously written about how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/eu-dma-ruling-could-completely-reshape-fitness-smartwatch-industry">Apple's locked watch ecosystem forced wearable brands to focus on fitness</a> and how brands like Pebble today can't offer messaging, third-party app stores, or other smarts because of Apple's restrictions. Until the EU forces Apple to open up its ecosystem, that won't change (on iOS, at least).</p><p>That's why I'm considering dropping money on the UNA Watch or Pebble Watch, even though they're objectively less feature-packed than other watches on the market. To support brands that will go off the beaten industry path and try new things.</p>
<h2 id="more-modular-smartwatches-please-2">More modular smartwatches, please</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:680px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.18%;"><img id="ZVsDMLGiqToXa3vmEnufhK" name="UNA-Watch-lineup" alt="Three UNA Watch models with different strap colors in a row on a dark table, showing different data on each watch face." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZVsDMLGiqToXa3vmEnufhK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="680" height="382" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: UNA)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I've seen other "hackable" watches recently like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pocuter/spectra">Spectra</a> that count on their community to come up with exciting ideas. But the UNA Watch is especially intriguing to me, assuming it lives up to the brand's promises.</p><p>I appreciate that you can take out the battery and replace it yourself. A lot of wearable tech isn't repairable — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-2-battery-tech-only-partially-solves-smart-rings-bigger-problem">especially smart rings</a> — and when your watch naturally loses capacity, manufacturers would rather that you buy a new watch than keep your old device chugging along.</p><p>With the UNA Watch, you can unscrew everything yourself, either to replace things or add new features years later. Based on the Kickstarter comments, they'll choose what new modules to make based on what the community asks for, such as the mic/speaker for Bluetooth calling.</p><p>Pebble originally tried letting people add "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smart-straps-failed-for-reason-but-deserve-second-chance">smart straps</a>" to augment their watches after the fact. I feel like UNA follows that legacy, except that the modules will slot directly onto the watch itself. The question will be how <em>many</em> modules you'll be able to add.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/unawatch/meet-una-the-modular-gps-sports-watch/rewards">UNA Watch Kickstarter</a> will take place until May 2, with plenty of early-bird deals available to save $75 on the eventual list price. It's expected to ship in August 2025. Meanwhile, if you're more interested in Pebble, its new watches are also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.repebble.com/">available for preorder now</a>, with lower prices but a later scheduled release date of December 2025.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="eW3YVYPBj8kfJrwTwMX6qg" name="Google-cloud-mwc-sign.jpg" alt="Google Cloud at MWC 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eW3YVYPBj8kfJrwTwMX6qg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I'll start with a short explainer for people who aren't in the U.S. and might wonder what all this fuss is about.</p><p>People coming illegally into the U.S. across the southern border is one of the most polarizing issues in the United States. Half the country hates it, and half of those people hate even the legal immigration of people from another culture. The other half knows it's a problem but hates the first half of the people enough to pretend it's not. Yeah, it's stupid, but it is what it is.</p><p>With that out of the way, here's what's happening and how Google is reportedly involved. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theintercept.com/2025/04/03/google-cbp-ai-border-surveillance-ibm-equitus/" target="_blank">The Intercept</a>, U.S. Customs and Border Protection plans to revamp some old surveillance towers around Tucson, Arizona.</p><p>They want to install equipment that will use AI to identify every person and vehicle that approaches the border. That's OK, and even my cheap-ass <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/older-nest-cameras-are-getting-the-google-home-app-treatment">Nest camera</a> can do it. But — there's always a but — they want to use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ibm.com/products/maximo/asset-inspection" target="_blank">IBM's Maximo inspection software</a>, which is usually put in factory machines to do quality control inspections, to ferret out people with backpacks or otherwise look like they want to do some crimes or something.</p>
<p>Google (and Amazon, of course) is allegedly facilitating this by providing hosting services for data streams and tools to train AI. There is surely a lot of money involved, and Google is thirsty for it.</p><p>A few years ago, Thomas Kurian, Google Cloud CEO, said the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/30/google-cloud-ceo-kurian-to-employees-not-working-on-border-wall.html" target="_blank">wasn't going to do anything</a> to help create a "virtual border wall," but that was then, and this is now. Android Central has reached out to Google for a comment on its involvement with the project and will update this article when we hear back.</p><p>But let's be clear: Google is not providing any of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-searchs-ai-mode-is-now-giving-early-access-to-select-users">its own AI tools</a> to make any of this happen, so even if it is involved, it's not directly being evil. It's just profiting from it.</p>
<h2 id="google-knows-better-2">Google knows better</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="NrC6Bo4HMBSdf7qf7Qq52f" name="Google-cloud-mwc-sign-02.jpg" alt="Google Cloud at MWC 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NrC6Bo4HMBSdf7qf7Qq52f.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You might be asking, "<em>Jerry, why is protecting the border something evil</em>?" It's <strong>not</strong>. It's 100% definitely not evil in any way, shape, or form. A country needs to be able to control how people come in and out and what they carry through. I'm not part of the half who hate the other half enough to hide my head in the sand.</p><p>But there is a right way and a wrong way. First, you can't dehumanize people who just want a better life. This is the biggest point of contention among the U.S. populace, and you have to admit the current political administration has said and done some pretty dehumanizing things.</p><p>Doing anything to help here is a bad PR move for any company, let alone one the size of Google. The optics of this are terrible, and most of the people working for Google and using its products aren't going to like it. Best of all, internet tech websites will make sure everyone knows about it; it's what we do best.</p>
<h2 id="it-s-probably-not-going-to-work-because-ai-2">It's probably not going to work, because AI</h2>
<p>The other issue is that Google knows this <strong>isn't going to work</strong> but is probably still salivating to get involved and collect a huge amount of taxpayer money for hosting services. Sure, it doesn't have to be responsible for the problems and directly do evil shit, but it gets to sit back and watch, pass Go, and collect their money.</p><p>AI can be trained to find people wearing backpacks. That's probably simple to do; tedious and time-consuming, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-wants-record-label-partnerships-but-is-it-a-good-idea">training an AI</a> for this is possible right now. Then what?</p>

<p>You aren't naive enough to think some bad stuff isn't going to happen to anyone targeted by an AI super-robo-border-camera. Google <em>definitely</em> isn't. Google uses AI to monitor YouTube (along with other things), and even that is a bona fide mess that Google can't control. If AI can't learn to spot what is copyright protected and what isn't, it's not good enough to do <em>anything</em> to a human being.</p><p>The best thing that could happen is that a truck filled with real human agents intercept the target. I won't speculate on the worst-case scenario. Still, bad guy will be caught. Innocent people will also be caught.</p><p>I wouldn't go hunting or backpacking around Tucson if I were you.</p>
<p>Assuming Google really is involved, it isn't really in the wrong and is simply fulfilling another government cloud hosting contract. It's just one that's tied to a deeply politically dividing issue, and the company should know better.</p><p>It would be the same if Google were to develop an online repository to help register and track every gun in America: half the country would go crazy, and the other half would say it's great. It's not great — it's stupid, and there are plenty of different ways to get that government money.</p>

Plus, they let users connect via Bluetooth, USB-C, or a 3.5mm headphone jack, though they do miss out on a few modern features like active noise cancellation. If those aren't dealbreakers for you, these are definitely worth considering compared to other competitors around this price.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want headphones with comfortable ear cups; you're looking for a pair of headphones with a balanced audio profile and high-quality sound.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you want a pair of headphones with a particularly bass-heavy response; you need active noise cancellation; you'd prefer earbuds or different-sized on-ear headphones.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/beats-solo-4-review">Beats Solo 4 wireless headphones</a> are a solid audio effort, though they don't sport ANC or some of the modern AI features many of today's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">best wireless headphones have.</a> Still, those who do get these generally like them for their mechanical button controls, their comfortable mid-size, on-ear fit, and the balanced audio profile in departure of the bass-driven nature of past Beats efforts.</p><p>Another major benefit of these headphones is that they can be used to listen to audio through Bluetooth, USB-C, or a headphone jack, which has become less common in recent years. Beats also says they offer up to 50 hours of battery life per charge, and they'll charge to around 5 hours of playback in just 10 minutes or so. You can also get them in four colors: Cloud Pink, Black and Gold, Matte Black, and Slate Blue.</p><p>While the lack of ANC might make these a no-go for some, the audio quality, broad connectivity, and comfort make it a competitive pick, especially with this discount.</p>
