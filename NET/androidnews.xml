Just days ahead of the sale, the retailer is offering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-productivity-octa-core-throughout-lockscreen/dp/B0DPJDYX61" target="_blank"><strong>36% off this Amazon Fire Max 11 "productivity" bundle</strong></a>, which comes with a first-party keyboard and stylus.</p><p>The Fire Max 11 is no doubt the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-kindle-fire-tablet#section-best-for-work-and-play">best Fire tablet for work and play</a>, in no small part due to its powerful CPU, large 11-inch display, and these first-party accessories, which are usually sold separately.</p><p>This particular deal is for the Fire Max 11 with 64GB of storage. While that isn't much, the tablet also comes with a microSD slot for those who want to add extra storage. Amazon says it offers up to 14 hours of battery life per charge, while it also includes both front and rear cameras.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$369.97" data-dimension48="$369.97" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-productivity-octa-core-throughout-lockscreen/dp/B0DPJDYX61" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:918px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="9iie992JWXErVM3sdETXnZ" name="Amazon Fire Max 11 productivity bundle render.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9iie992JWXErVM3sdETXnZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="918" height="918" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Amazon Fire Max 11 productivity bundle:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-productivity-octa-core-throughout-lockscreen/dp/B0DPJDYX61" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$369.97" data-dimension48="$369.97" data-dimension25=""><del>$369.97</del> <strong>$236.49 for Early Prime Day deals</strong></a></p><p>Amazon has cut the price of its Fire Max 11 tablet bundle by over $130, offering buyers a tablet, keyboard, and stylus all for just $236. The Fire Max 11 offers a large tablet screen, an improved processor compared to the rest of the Fire lineup, and up to 14 hours of battery life per charge.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-productivity-octa-core-throughout-lockscreen/dp/B0DPJDYX61" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$369.97" data-dimension48="$369.97" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you're looking for a powerful tablet with a long battery life that you can use for work, hardcore gaming, or other activities that require high-level performance; you want a tablet option that comes with a keyboard and/or stylus; you prefer a larger tablet screen of around 11 inches.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you'd prefer to have access to the Google Play Store without side-loading; you need a tablet that includes a 3.5mm headphone jack; you need a tablet with a selfie cam that's more powerful than 8MP, and you have the budget to upgrade.</p><p>The Amazon <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-fire-max-11-review">Fire Max 11 </a>is far and away the best out of the Fire tablet lineup, and it still offers a pretty fair price tag. From the 11-inch TUV display and the roughly 14-hour battery life, the tablet is designed to be suitable for a wide range of work tasks, while still being lightweight enough to be used on the go. With this bundle, you get a solid value with the inclusion of a keyboard and stylus, marking $133 in savings.</p><p>It also includes front and rear cameras, both 8MP, as well as dual-speaker audio, a fingerprint scanner, and USB-C audio capabilities. Unfortunately, it doesn't include a 3.5mm headphone jack, but that can be remedied using USB-C or Bluetooth.</p><p>This discount is for the Fire Max 11 bundle with just 64GB of storage, though it also includes a microSD slot for expandable storage of up to 1TB. Performance is backed by the powerful MediaTek MTK8188J processor, and it features split screen and other multitasking features supported by the included 4GB of RAM.</p><p>The bottom line is that, if you were already looking to cash in on a tablet, keyboard, and stylus combo bundle, this might be a good chance to do so.</p> ]]></dc:content>

More and more people are turning to ChatGPT, for better or worse, while Google is attempting to wedge <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> into every conceivable space possible. Not to mention that we're getting more and more "AI-powered" features with every new flagship phone release.</p><p>That said, I realize that when it comes to actually using AI on my various smartphones, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebooks</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/gemini-notebooklm-gaming-guide-creation">gaming handhelds</a>, and so on, at the end of the day, everyone's AI experience is the same. I should probably modify that to say, "everyone's AI experience <em>can be</em> the same." No matter how you try to phrase it, the general idea remains the same, as someone with an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-17-pro-review">iPhone 17 Pro</a>, Pixel 10 Pro Fold, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-a26-vs-moto-g-2025-budget-battle">Samsung Galaxy A26</a> can all do the same things with AI.</p><p>No, I'm not talking about the features that Apple, Google, and Samsung try to sell you on in the various ads and commercials. That's cool and all, but the commonality between a phone that costs almost $2,000 and one that's less than $200 is that they can all download the same AI apps.</p><p>Currently, the most prominent players are Gemini, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/openais-gpt-5-model-is-the-first-to-give-gemini-2-5-pro-a-run-for-its-money">ChatGPT</a>, Copilot, Claude, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/the-motorola-razr-and-perplexity-are-trying-to-change-how-you-use-your-phone">Perplexity</a>, Grok, and DeepSeek. All of those apps, and many more, are available on either platform, ensuring you'll always have access to your conversations and creations. Yes, there <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/it-still-sucks-that-the-iphone-gets-new-apps-before-android" target="_blank">might be times</a> when the iOS version of ChatGPT gets something first, but the same can certainly be true for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini on Android</a>.</p><p>At the time of this writing, ChatGPT holds the top spot in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps#:~:text=Top%20charts,Top%20paid" target="_blank">Play Store</a>, and the next AI chatbot app doesn't appear until Microsoft Copilot, in tenth place. Surprisingly, the opposite is true on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apps.apple.com/ai/charts/iphone/productivity-apps/6007" target="_blank">Apple App Store</a>, where <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/hey-siri-wheres-apple-intelligence-gemini-is-now-the-top-free-app-on-ios">Google Gemini is the current top free app</a>, followed by ChatGPT in second and DeepSeek in fifth. It just goes to show that Google's marketing is paying off, although there's definitely an argument to be made about the iPhone being a better Google phone than Android.</p><h2 id="apple-s-playing-catch-up-2">Apple's playing catch up</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="S4NsoYm7QWdNXLMmer3dyR" name="WWDC 2025 — Apple Intelligence and Apple Devices" alt="Screenshot of WWDC with Apple Intelligence and Apple devices on the screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/S4NsoYm7QWdNXLMmer3dyR.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple )</span></figcaption></figure><p>Of course, there's another side to the coin here, and it's one that re-opens the age-old "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/everything-apple-stole-from-android-and-wear-os-at-wwdc-2025">iOS vs. Android</a>" debate. Simply put, Siri is awful and can't hold a candle to Gemini, ChatGPT, or even DeepSeek. Apple is so far behind the 8-ball here that it partnered with OpenAI and Google when introducing "Apple Intelligence" last year.</p><p>Recently, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-03/apple-plans-ai-search-engine-for-siri-to-rival-openai-google-siri-talks-advance">Mark Gurman of Bloomberg reports</a> that Apple "is planning to launch its own artificial intelligence-powered web search tool next year, stepping up competition with OpenAI and Perplexity AI Inc." Based on the report, this just sounds like it will be an Apple-branded version of Gemini, as Gurman says "The companies reached a formal agreement...to evaluate and test a Google-developed AI model to help power the voice assistant."</p><p>However, Apple isn't stopping there, as this AI-powered search will also be implemented in Siri. But instead of trying to figure out the score of the game or find the name of a brand, it's said that Siri will finally be able to "tap into personal data and on-screen content to better fulfill queries." By pulling resources from other departments and refocusing its efforts, Apple could deliver this enormous overhaul as soon as March 2026 with iOS 26.4.</p><p>Even so, while we all wait for this big AI overhaul, you can still download apps like Gemini, ChatGPT, Copilot, or Perplexity and perform many AI-related tasks we hope to see from Apple and Siri.</p><h2 id="everyone-else-is-widening-the-gap-2">Everyone else is widening the gap</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="D9mryqDg7rcpRyc4xs2WZW" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-gemini-app" alt="The Gemini app on a Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/D9mryqDg7rcpRyc4xs2WZW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Meanwhile, Google has just announced new Gemini models, along with a complete overhaul and revamp of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-home-app-gemini-integration">Google Home app</a>. Additionally, Gemini will be available on our existing smart speakers and Nest Hubs, a feature we've been eagerly awaiting.</p><p>At the same time, OpenAI recently announced "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/12440090-instant-checkout-buy-directly-from-merchants-through-chatgpt">Instant Checkout in ChatGPT</a>," allowing users to make purchases using AI. It also introduced "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-pulse/">ChatGPT Pulse</a>," which will "deliver personalized updates based on your chats, feedback, and connected apps like your calendar."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="qfhgRE4cbo6gDd98HUwdMd" name="google-gemini-claude-chatgpt-samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-google-pixel-9-pro-fold" alt="Gemini 2.5 Pro on the Galaxy Chromebook Plus, ChatGPT on the Galaxy Z Fold 6, Claude on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qfhgRE4cbo6gDd98HUwdMd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Why does any of that matter? Because all of those new features from Google and OpenAI will soon be available on any phone (if they aren't already). So, sure, needing to download an app isn't as seamless as just having it integrated at the OS level. But does it <em>really</em> matter given the abundance of options at our disposal, especially when you can just pick the app that works best for you in any particular instance?</p><p>To answer my own question, no, it doesn't really matter.

This isn't the first time Samsung has partnered with Coinbase, and this latest partnership aims to bring a more "premium membership experience" to its users looking to engage with crypto. Samsung states its Wallet users will now have "special access to a free 3-month subscription" to Coinbase One.</p><p>The senior vice president of mobile product management at Samsung Electronics America, Drew Blackard, said, "With our Coinbase partnership, Galaxy users have a simple and streamlined way to access crypto from a leader in the industry."</p><p>As such, Coinbase One in Samsung Wallet gives users boosted staking rewards and "exclusive" partner offers. The fine print states these "offers" are only available for U.S. users (new subscribers) and the "promotional offer is limited to the Standard Tier subscription of Coinbase One." The free three-month subscription to Coinbase One also includes zero trading fees "on select assets."</p><p>If you're using Coinbase for the first time (your first trade) through Samsung Wallet, the post states you'll receive a free $25 credit.</p><h2 id="going-further-for-convenient-payments-2">Going further for convenient payments</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:984px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.49%;"><img id="3ndVGeZqmpjV3tGaYzhMfX" name="samsung-coinbase-crypto-announcement" alt="Samsung Pay integrates with Coinbase, bringing easy tap to pay crypto transactions for users." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3ndVGeZqmpjV3tGaYzhMfX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="984" height="546" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Coinbase)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While Samsung Wallet is there for Galaxy users' online payment needs, in July, the company rolled out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/crypto-payments-made-easy-samsung-pay-coinbase-app-update">its initial Coinbase partnership</a> for crypto. The app saw full Coinbase integration, which arrived for "select" users in the U.S. and Canada in August. This was just to get the ball rolling, as Samsung said users would have the additional convenience of cryptocurrency payments and management right from their handheld devices.</p><p>Coinbase said it was working on extending support to more users in the future, so hopefully that's rolling out now with its Coinbase One membership addition.</p><p>Samsung Wallet's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/samsung-wallets-tap-to-transfer-feature-arrives-in-the-us-for-seamless-p2p-payments">been on a TLC grind recently</a>. Users have been given access to Samsung's tap-to-pay feature for direct P2P (peer-to-peer) payments between two devices in the same room. It's an NFC feature that lets two people quickly pay each other without the typical hassle. Additionally, the app now lets users split in-store payments for an easier online experience.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Now, a new leak has revealed when the OnePlus 15 will launch in global markets, and if accurate, the release date is not far away.</p><p>According to a report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hindi/oneplus-15-launch-date-in-india-13-november-exclusive-leak/">91Mobiles</a> (in Hindi), the OnePlus 15 will launch globally on November 13, 2025. Citing industry sources, the report claims the phone will launch just weeks after its China debut on October 27, 2025.

It seems these summaries will only be "suggested" or invoked whenever there's a longer notification, like something you can just read from the brief preview in your notification panel (think long texts). When receiving a lengthy notification, the publication notes a Samsung alert that states, "your longer conversations can now be summarized to give you quick recaps."</p><p>The alert suggests throwing users into their Settings to activate it. Once it does, it seems Samsung has created a dedicated "Notification Summaries" page.</p><p>The downside to this test is that it's just that: a test. Other than an illustration vaguely showing what this AI summarized feature could look like in the end, the publication was unable to get it to actually function. However, Samsung reiterates that AI summaries can be used for "long messages."</p><p>More than that, it gives the typical disclaimer that the feature utilizes AI on your device, and it "may sometimes make mistakes." Not only is a toggle there for the feature, but it seems Samsung is also thinking of adding a "Manage apps" menu for apps you don't want the AI to consider summarizing.</p><h2 id="the-buzz-about-one-ui-8-5-2">The buzz about One UI 8.5</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:270px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:222.22%;"><img id="8Df6eBGKwKyGnWxt63qKrk" name="samsung-one-ui-8-5-ai-notification-summaries" alt="Samsung is reportedly testing AI-powered notification summaries for long texts in One UI 8.5." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8Df6eBGKwKyGnWxt63qKrk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="270" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: SamMobile)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The funny thing about this report is that we've heard about Samsung potentially thinking about AI-based notification summaries <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/one-ui-7-beta-could-be-just-around-the-corner-with-an-apple-intelligence-like-twist">since before One UI 7</a>. At the time, the company was thinking about bringing in the feature inspired by Apple's software for iPhones. This feature never made it to the light of day, and we're now seeing it rumored for Samsung's next big update: One UI 8.5 over a year later. While Samsung was thinking about this back in 2024, Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-notification-summaries">thinking about it this year</a> for Android 16.</p><p>In March, it was alleged that Android 16 could roll out these summaries for conversations, again, mirroring what Apple has. This feature for Android 16 was spotted during its 3rd Beta, so it remains to be seen if we get it or not.</p><p>One UI 8.5 rumors <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-is-already-chasing-one-ui-8-5-new-leak-spots-galaxy-s25-test">cropped up recently</a>, as a report claims Samsung has already put its early test builds on its test server using the Galaxy S25 series. Nobody's certain about these features, other than this update should be quite extensive for Galaxy users. Speculation suggests we won't see One UI 8.5 until next year, around the time the Galaxy S26 launches, potentially.</p> ]]></dc:content>

These scores, until now, have generally been reliable, giving users a quick overview of their sleep quality and overall recovery.</p><p>The Watch typically generates a score between 0–100 based on various factors from the previous night's rest.

According to Mosseri, this test would change how users view Instagram's Home page after opening the app. Instead of being immediately greeted by recommended posts or posts from people you follow, you'd see Reels.</p><p>This change is simply an option that lucky testers in India can toggle if they've been granted random access.</p><p>Mosseri's example shows that users on the homepage would see the usual Stories at the top and, underneath, the Reels would begin. Scrolling down would drop you into the classic Reels feed, which just has you scrolling through the short-form, vertical content. Additionally, the bottom navigation bar would place DMs down there. Mosseri states, "Reels and DMs have driven most all our growth at Instagram over the last few years, so we are exploring making them the first two tabs."</p><p>So, users in the test won't find the DMs icon at the top right. It'll be at the bottom beside the homepage icon.</p><p>What's curious is that Mosseri states this test will still surface photos from users on your homepage, though it's unclear if there's a break in the Reels while scrolling to see regular posts or what. Mosser says, "We'll see if anyone is into it...," likely indicating Instagram isn't set on this unless the masses are.</p><h2 id="testing-the-waters-2">Testing the waters</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:521px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:115.16%;"><img id="MZ4njbqQxX8kmri6PCtPuj" name="instagram-reels-first-dms-home-page-test" alt="Instagram's head, Adam Mosseri, states the platform will test showing Reels first on its homepage, as well as moving the DMs icon to the bottom in India." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MZ4njbqQxX8kmri6PCtPuj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="521" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Adam Mosseri / Threads)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Instagram ran another Reels test earlier this year, which saw users experiment with videos that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/instagram-is-trying-out-password-locked-reels-and-the-weeknd-is-first-to-test-it">were password-locked</a>. Reels that were essentially private, only accessible to those with the unique pass, featured secret codes and hints. This was seen as a way for creators to have a "secret club," if you will, for dropping new merch or content for those die-hard fans. Instagram started this test with The Weeknd, giving them early access to some cool things if they cracked the code.</p><p>Of course, beyond music, anyone could create these locked Reels and try to stir up hype, which is exactly what Instagram was going for.</p><p>An update users can get their hands on some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/instagrams-ai-now-detects-and-protects-teens-even-if-their-profile-says-theyre-adults">new protective measures</a> for teen accounts on the platform.

It was also speculated that the headset could sport photo editing, on-device AI (Galaxy AI), and more, thanks to Qualcomm's assistance.</p><p>Project Moohan will seemingly feature quite a bit of Gemini throughout its experience, too.</p><p>That display could be 1.3 inches with a 3552×3840 resolution and roughly 90fps capabilities, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-could-use-sony-4k-micro-oled-displays-in-project-moohan-headset">per recent leaks this year</a>. Rumors about the headset's pre-registration might only fuel excitement, as we <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsungs-moohan-headset-might-launch-soon">previously only had</a> speculation on its launch date. Reports claim Samsung is looking at another Galaxy event this month, on October 21, to reveal the Galaxy XR headset. Samsung might not dive headfirst so quickly, as the company could come out of the gate initially with only 100,000 units.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It isn't just tech products either; I just bought a washing machine, and LG saw fit to shoehorn AI into that as well.</p><p>While AI is pervasive, it doesn't actually do much. That hasn't prevented phone brands from leaning heavily into AI, positioning it as a dubious differentiator on their latest phones. If you're like me and are ambivalent towards generative AI, here's how to disable it on your phone.</p><p>In this guide, I'm highlighting Google and Samsung phones as they're the two brands that have full-fledged AI suites. Chinese brands are just getting started with AI on their phones, so I'm not focusing on Funtouch OS or ColorOS at the moment, instead talking about Pixel and Galaxy devices.</p><p>Before we get started, you'll need to know that a lot of AI features are baked into the interface, so disabling them isn't quite straightforward. This is doubly so with Pixels, as Google integrates AI-assisted features into most of its utilities, including the Phone dialer, Messages, Google Photos, and Gmail. Similarly, Samsung integrates its own flavor of AI (dubbed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>) into its apps, but if you don't see yourself using any of these, it's easy to disable most features.</p><p>I'm using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/with-the-pixel-10-pro-xl-google-finally-made-a-faultless-flagship">Pixel 10 Pro XL</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> in the steps outlined below, but any recent Pixel or Galaxy phone will have the same flow.</p><h2 id="how-to-disable-ai-features-on-your-google-pixel-2">How to disable AI features on your Google Pixel</h2><p>Let's start with <strong>Gemini</strong>, Google's latest digital assistant. It comes pre-installed on latest Pixels, and cannot be uninstalled as a result. If you don't see yourself using Gemini, you can disable it — that's the closest you can come to uninstalling it. Here's how to do that:</p><ol start="1"><li>Navigate to <strong>Gemini</strong>.</li><li><strong>Long press</strong> the app icon.</li><li>Choose <strong>App info</strong>.</li><li>Tap <strong>Disable</strong>.</li></ol><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5456px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:54.84%;"><img id="huPmohJSzdVfmfvo8PYNmZ" name="Gemini" alt="Disabling Gemini on a Pixel 10" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/huPmohJSzdVfmfvo8PYNmZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5456" height="2992" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Next up is <strong>AI Mode</strong>; Pixels have a Google search bar located at the bottom of the home screen, and with the Pixel 10, the AI Mode button is integrated into the bar.

Garmin Ltd" was filed on September 30 in the U.S. District Court in Colorado.</li><li>Strava filed a 2011 patent for activity segments and a 2013 patent for heatmaps, and now claims that Garmin's Live Segments and heatmaps violate them.</li><li>Strava and Garmin had a 2015 Master Cooperation Agreement to use Strava Live Segments on Garmin watches.</li><li>Strava is demanding a "permanent injunction" on selling any Garmin watches with Strava technology due to "irreparable harm" to Strava's brand.</li></ul><p>Strava has launched a legal battle against Garmin, one of its biggest partners, for "causing ongoing harm to Strava" by using its patented features "in ways that Strava has never authorized or licensed." And it's demanding that a U.S. District judge approve a permanent injunction to stop Garmin from selling watches with its technology.</p><p>The features in question, as detailed by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2025/10/strava-sues-garmin-demands-stop-selling-devices.html">DC Rainmaker's coverage</a> of the lawsuit, are Strava Live Segments, heatmaps, and popularity routing.</p><p>Both Strava and Garmin Live Segments appear on high-end Garmin watches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Fenix 8</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-970-review">Forerunner 970</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-venu-x1-review">Venu X1</a>, as well as its Edge bike computers, so athletes can see their mapped progress and race against other leaderboard times.</p><p>Garmin's Heatmap, meanwhile, is available to all <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a> owners through the Connect app, while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.garmin.com/en-US/?faq=LsCSM91UbF0avJvjnYuFZA">Trendline Popularity</a> routing is also restricted to its higher-end models. If this lawsuit succeeds, Strava's injunction would require Garmin to remove these features to continue selling its devices.</p><p>Strava clarified to DCR that its lawsuit isn't intended to "disrupt the ability of Garmin users to sync their data with Strava," so that shouldn't be going away. But this lawsuit is still an aggressive move for a brand that relies on fitness watch partners to provide it with data.</p><p>Garmin, meanwhile, has told Android Central that it "won't be commenting on pending litigation."</p><h2 id="the-strava-garmin-fallout-explained-2">The Strava-Garmin fallout, explained</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="A3RqLHv9Ssu2dU4mCznxLY" name="strava-live-segments.jpeg" alt="Strava app showing Live Segment records" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/A3RqLHv9Ssu2dU4mCznxLY.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3200" height="1800" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Strava segment leaderboards </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Strava first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://patents.justia.com/patent/9116922">patented</a> its live segments in 2011, after which Garmin launched its own Live Segments in 2014. According to Strava, Garmin and Strava then entered into a Master Cooperation Agreement (MCA) in 2015 to allow Strava Live Segments on Garmin watches, but not for Garmin to "adapt, reverse engineer, use, copy, modify, or distribute" Strava's features for its own Live Segments.</p><p>Now, Strava is claiming that Garmin "leveraged this access to carefully study those features, painstakingly copy them, and then release them as Garmin features," and that Garmin ignored Strava when "informally" asked to stop in June and July 2025.</p><p>Garmin Live Segments have remained visibly available since 2015, without any previous pushback from Strava. The 2025 launches of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-connect-plus-in-depth-hands-on-much-more-than-an-ai-unfortunately">Garmin Connect Plus</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/i-put-garmins-connect-trails-breathing-variations-and-rucking-sport-to-the-test">Trails+ routes</a>, however, put Garmin's app in closer competition with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/strava-interview-athlete-intelligence-inaccurate-gps-race-leaderboards-and-more">Strava's Athlete Intelligence AI</a>, and Strava's new leadership may be less inclined to play nice with a direct rival to its monthly subscription service.</p><p>Garmin Live Segments have remained available since 2015, and we're curious if Garmin agrees that the MCA forbade them from continuing to expand the feature, or if it disputes the idea that it copied Strava. But we'll have to wait for Garmin's legal reply to learn more.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Ep3ZE8r8WgfGWDzqEAhbNf" name="garmin-strava-live-segments-screenshot" alt="An official screenshot of where to find both Strava Live Segments and Garmin Live Segments setup in the Garmin Connect app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ep3ZE8r8WgfGWDzqEAhbNf.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin / Strava)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As for Strava's heatmaps, its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://patents.justia.com/patent/9297651">patent</a> was originally filed in December 2013 for tracking users' GPS workouts en masse to determine the most popular routes nearby. Night heatmaps are the most recent focus, with an emphasis on safety.</p><p>Strava asserts that Garmin's "Trendline/Popularity routing, heatmaps, Courses, and related features" infringe on its patent. DC Rainmaker claims, however, that Garmin first launched heatmaps back in early 2013, while other fitness brands like RaceShape had them in 2012.</p><p>Garmin may attempt to have Strava's heatmap patent disputed, given that its own service seemingly preceded the patent. But regardless, Strava is challenging Garmin's use of this patented feature after over a decade of letting their two heatmap features coexist.</p><h2 id="what-comes-next-2">What comes next?</h2><p>Strava is gearing up to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/fitness-tracking-app-strava-looks-hire-banks-ipo-2025-09-17/">launch its IPO</a> and was valued at $2.2 billion earlier this year. It's interesting timing to see the app open litigation against a popular smartwatch brand prior to going public.</p><p>Strava told DCR that "Garmin has been increasingly aggressive to its partners lately (perhaps due to competitive pressure) and Strava is standing up for the hard work our teams have put into building unique features."</p><p>In truth, both companies have been establishing more strict guidelines with their APIs, telling third-party partners how they're allowed to use their data. Strava's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2024/11/stravas-changes-to-kill-off-apps.html">2024 policy </a>prevented other apps from displaying Strava data or using it for AI features.</p><p>Given Garmin's lack of comment, we'll have to wait and see whether it merely defends itself of Strava's claims or attempts to countersue Strava. Until it's resolved, Garmin watch owners and Strava users should be unaffected; in the long run, however, they could lose access to some popular features if this lawsuit is successful.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Instead of relying on external screen protectors or clunky add-ons, Samsung is reportedly building privacy right into the phone’s hardware and software.</p><p>Now, a new leak from One UI 8.5, courtesy of @achultra on X, gives us our first real look at how the feature will work, and it’s a whole system of controls designed to keep sensitive information away from prying eyes (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sammyguru.com/first-look-at-galaxy-s26-ultra-privacy-display-settings/" target="_blank">SammyGuru</a>).</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The next S26 Ultra will have a privacy feature that keeps people from peeking at your screen. pic.twitter.com/tFcgeFpCqG<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1973610514719842717">October 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>According to leaked screenshots, users will have the option to adjust how intense the effect is and define specific conditions for when it activates. Samsung seems to be preparing automatic triggers, such as detecting when you’re in a crowded place like a bus, train, or café, and then dialing down the display’s visibility from side angles.</p><p>There’s also a Custom Conditions section buried in the settings, letting you choose your own scenarios, like enabling privacy automatically when you open banking apps or when the lock screen PIN entry appears.</p><h2 id="granular-control-over-screen-areas-2">Granular control over screen areas</h2><p>The controls are surprisingly granular. Leaks show that you’ll be able to select which parts of the display remain fully visible and which get blurred or dimmed. Notifications, picture-in-picture windows, lock screen fields, and private images can all be hidden automatically when Privacy Display is running.</p><p>For users who want maximum protection, Samsung appears to be adding a “Maximum Privacy” mode, which makes the display look even darker and less readable from side angles. Under the hood, the feature seems to rely on something Samsung calls Flex Magic Pixel technology, which tweaks pixel behavior in real time — likely with AI — so that screen content becomes much harder to read unless you’re looking directly at it.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:402px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:216.42%;"><img id="hUuoSLGoq65TfXUxFCWQoK" name="Galaxy-S26-Ultra-privacy-display-feature" alt="Privacy display toggles in Galaxy S26 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hUuoSLGoq65TfXUxFCWQoK.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="402" height="870" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @achultra / X)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:402px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:216.42%;"><img id="mk65qvspwkZ3tKpFNCoRoK" name="Galaxy-S26-Ultra-privacy-display-feature" alt="Privacy display toggles in Galaxy S26 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mk65qvspwkZ3tKpFNCoRoK.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="402" height="870" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @achultra / X)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>What’s interesting is how this ties into One UI 8.5.

It’s unclear how much brightness or color accuracy the display will sacrifice when Privacy Display is active, or whether video playback and gaming will look noticeably worse. And since this is still based on leaks, Samsung could refine or even cut certain elements before the feature reaches the public.</p><p>But if these settings are any indication, the Galaxy S26 Ultra could be the first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">mainstream phone</a> to ship with a built-in, fully customizable privacy filter that adapts to your surroundings.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Yes, <em>the</em> Gordon Ramsay. Of course, he has no idea who I am or what I'm doing in his kitchen, but Meta lets me see everything via its new Hyperscape app on Meta Quest headsets. Someone at Meta specifically visited Ramsay's house and used a Quest headset to map the space, presenting it in hyper-realistic 3D for the entire world to see.</p><p>Google did something similar with Photosphere back in 2012, but that technology only allowed you to capture a spherical panorama. Meta's new Hyperscape app lets you not only walk around and scan anywhere you want, but also allows you to virtually walk around the area and see everything in full, hyper-realistic detail afterward.</p><p>Walking through a world that quite literally looks <em>real </em>sounds like the future of VR, but Meta is making it happen <strong>today</strong>.</p><h2 id="a-walk-in-the-park-2">A walk in the park</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:50.00%;"><img id="Q82H3vKMTUxG8LSLBM6suH" name="meta-quest-hyperscape-bamboo" alt="Exploring a bamboo forest using the Hyperscape app on Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Q82H3vKMTUxG8LSLBM6suH.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="300" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Exploring a bamboo forest in the Hyperscape app (on Meta Quest 3) </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I live right by the Biltmore Estate, the largest home in the United States. I most often visit the picturesque grounds for camera reviews, but this time I came toting my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Meta Quest 3</a>, instead. I got a few strange looks and questions from guests, but it was all for science.</p><p>Now, whenever I want to show someone how gorgeous the house looks, I don't have to drag them to the grounds. I can show them in VR. Hyperscape makes it easy to scan any location and recreate it in 3D as you walk around and inspect the place.</p><p>It's truly remarkable to see how much can be accomplished with a clever bit of AI and the right hardware. All you need is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-review">$299 Meta Quest 3S</a> headset and a few minutes to walk around. Suddenly, you're creating impressive virtual spaces that you will soon be able to invite people into. It's a fascinating look at how the metaverse is evolving before our eyes, and it proves that you don't need a powerful gaming PC just to get something that looks this good.</p><h2 id="setup-is-easy-2">Setup is easy</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:50.00%;"><img id="3b8dv5xyqUw5X7rzJQyagP" name="meta-quest-hyperscape-scan-bamboo" alt="Scanning a bamboo forest using the Hyperscape app on a Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3b8dv5xyqUw5X7rzJQyagP.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="300" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Scanning a bamboo forest </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>To try it yourself, download the free Hyperscape Beta app onto your Meta Quest 3 or Quest 3S headset, then click "create world" on the main menu. You start by <em>walking </em>around any area you want to map with the headset. Since you can see the world around you through the headset's cameras, this should feel pretty normal.</p><p>As you scan the room, the Quest will overlay a blue grid on top of all the objects, walls, floors, and ceilings. When you're happy with the amount of space you've scanned — I have yet to find a limit — click the <strong>Next </strong>button to head to step two.</p><p>The next step is detail refinement, where you'll walk around once more and provide more mapping information. As you walk around, that blue grid evaporates to let you know the map no longer looks like basic PS1 geometry and is now in full-fledged realism mode.</p><p>The third step is almost optional and involves looking at the ceiling while walking around, which isn't applicable when mapping tall or outdoor spaces.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:50.00%;"><img id="fhun9PT2R7ZcvjpGHf6cQV" name="meta-quest-hyperscape-gordon-ramsay-kitchen" alt="Exploring Gordon Ramsay's kitchen using the Hyperscape app on Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fhun9PT2R7ZcvjpGHf6cQV.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="300" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Exploring Gordon Ramsay's kitchen in Hyperscape </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>And that's it. Now you can take your headset off and carry on with your day while Meta's AI-powered servers put all the data together. You don't need to know how to write code or spend hours learning a complicated new program.</p><p>The Meta Horizon app on your phone will notify you when it's done, allowing you to fully walk around in the space you've just mapped. It feels like magic, and it's going to enable a whole new era of virtual visits to all sorts of places.</p><p>Meta also has several examples of other spaces — like Gordon Ramsay's home kitchen — as well as a collection of the worlds you made. In the future, it's expected that you'll be able to share these spaces with others, inviting friends, family members, or anyone else into each virtual space as a way to remotely converse without having to look down at 6-inch rectangles.</p><h2 id="massive-potential-2">Massive potential</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PBNqTRZprxQ" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>It's hard to express just how impressive this tech really is without seeing it for yourself. While most Meta Quest games are stuck in the PS2 or PS3 graphics eras, Hyperscape sometimes feels like jumping into a PS6 world. Things aren't perfect yet; some textures aren't ultra-high-res, sometimes you'll find ghost geometry in complicated places (like trees), and calculation errors can be seen on text or other places. However, the lighting and even fine detail on complex objects, such as plants, are stunningly impressive.</p><p>I could easily see Meta rolling this out to Horizon Worlds or other spaces once it gets the backend systems ready for sharing. This tech requires a lot of server-side streaming, so it's important for Meta to get the co-location of players right.</p><p>This has massive potential that I can see not just for social spaces, but also for businesses and other functions. I can easily imagine real estate agents using this to virtually showcase homes for people looking to move out of town. Businesses and restaurants could use it to give people an idea of the vibe or look of the space in a way Google Maps doesn't. You could even use it to revisit your first house or favorite place years later.</p><p>Meta dabbles in so many experimental ideas with its Reality Labs department, and Hyperscape is clearly one of the big ideas about to deliver a serious payoff, if my experience with it is any indication.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="801fd96a-1887-44ed-8a37-23a94b875e11">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fCUPHg8DY6xth6JoYMuDGK.jpg' alt="An official product render of the Meta Quest 3S with its controllers"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Meta Quest 3S</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Whether you love social environments, puzzle game, multiplayer shooters, or just checking out the next evolution of technology, the Meta Quest 3s has it all at a lower price than you imagined.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

The update hasn’t hit every device yet, but those who've seen it have plenty to say about the changes.</p><p>The most obvious tweak is the layout of video pages. The channel’s profile image is now larger and sits right next to the video title, instead of being tucked underneath. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-is-now-the-most-frequently-used-podcast-client-in-the-us">YouTube</a> is also swapping traditional channel names for usernames, as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/youtube-mobile-app-ui-changes-3603148/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, the familiar row of buttons under a video — such as like, dislike, share, download, and subscribe — has lost its text labels, leaving only icons.

It's possible this is currently being tested on a subset of users. That means YouTube is likely gauging feedback before a full rollout, though given the size of the changes, it’s clear the platform is serious about pushing the new look forward.</p><p>Whether you love it or hate it, the new YouTube mobile UI represents a clear shift in philosophy. It’s a bid for a cleaner, more content-first experience that tries to streamline how we interact with videos.</p><p>But as with any radical redesign, it’s a gamble. For every user who appreciates the fresh, uncluttered look, there’s another who sees a familiar, efficient tool being rearranged into something unfamiliar.</p><p>The real test won't be in the initial outrage, but in whether we all get used to it or if YouTube decides to listen to the feedback and tweak the formula once again.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This kind of hands-on, conversational support lowers the barrier to entry and makes smart home upgrades feel less intimidating.</p><p>AI also helps users discover features they didn’t know existed.

Many of the new AI features are coming to existing devices, which means the hardware market may not see a major uplift right away. In fact, global smart speaker and display shipments are forecasted to decline in 2025 and into the first half of 2026.</p><p>Cameras are expected to grow, but only modestly—around 3% in 2025, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=IDC_P37480">according to IDC</a>. Macroeconomic pressures persist, and the installed base of smart home devices is already large, limiting the need for immediate upgrades.</p><p>However, the new features like AI-generated summaries of what went on around your home based on video analysis are likely to increase usage and engagement. If execution lives up to the promise, this could drive longer-term growth.</p><p>Additionally, both smart speakers and cameras are expected to see a rise in average selling price (ASP), as the most compelling features require newer, more capable hardware. This shift could help manufacturers offset volume declines while offering consumers more value.</p><h2 id="what-about-apple-2">What about Apple?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2070px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="TspK8cw2ucPMRV64qWaxHQ" name="apple-intelligence-prompt-imore.jpg" alt="Apple Intelligence prompt on iPhone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TspK8cw2ucPMRV64qWaxHQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2070" height="1164" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Apple has been relatively quiet on both the AI and smart home fronts.

Moreover, the Scribe <em>with </em>a front light display now features its LED "tightly against the display" to facilitate narrower bezels, which means more screen for your eyeballs.</p><p>While that rounds up the more forward-facing design changes for this year's Scribe, Amazon's Scribe Colorsoft is the first of its kind for the form factor, and follows a year <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-colorsoft-signature-edition-launch-details">after the very first color Kindle</a>.</p><h2 id="the-kindle-scribe-gets-colorful-2">The Kindle Scribe gets colorful</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="hgyFc2uG3EfHDsL93CsiAU" name="amazon-kindle-scribe-colorsoft-render" alt="Amazon launched its first Kindle Scribe Colorsoft, which soft colors to users looking to highlight text, scribble notes, and more." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hgyFc2uG3EfHDsL93CsiAU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Amazon)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The first Kindle Scribe Colorsoft packs the same updated designs as the other two Scribes this year. The primary difference is that Amazon has packaged this one with a soft-on-the-eyes colored screen that still brings out that Scribe experience. While the lights are soft for this colored display, Amazon says users should still find vibrant hues, not washed-out tones.</p><p>There's a subtle difference with the Scribe Colorsoft, and that regards its new rendering engine that keeps the writing side of the Kindle fast, smooth, and improves its colors even more. Though everything's not in black and white, the company claims the Scribe Colorsoft can deliver "weeks of battery life."</p><p>Putting aside the hardware side of these devices for a moment, there's a huge set of AI updates for the Scribe that consumers should know. Amazon's been fueling its latest devices with AI, just like it did with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/amazon-fire-tv/amazon-new-fire-tv-series-goodbye-to-android-with-vegaos-launch">new Fire TV series</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/amazon-ai-powered-echo-series-devices-blend-alexa-plus-omnisence">Echo devices this week</a>. For the Scribe, consumers will notice a revamped Home that brings Quick Notes and the ability to easily open previously opened books, documents, and more.</p><p>Inside Workspace, users can store and organize their imported/created documents, notebooks, books, and other digital items. This is further enhanced if you've connected your OneDrive or Google Drive account, as those files are also easily accessible. The Scribe Colorsoft sits away from the others, bringing a Shader tool, colored pens, and highlights for annotations and notes.</p><p>Amazon also highlights its available AI-powered search involving your documents and files. Users can ask the AI to summarize those files with follow-up questions available afterward.</p><h2 id="coming-soon-2">Coming soon...</h2><p>The Kindle Scribe (front light) starts at $499, the Scribe without its front light starts at $429, and the Scribe Colorsoft begins at $629 in the U.S. Consumers should be aware that these devices are listed on Amazon; however, there's no button to pre-order yet. The post states this devices are coming "later this year," so keep your eyes peeled for more details.</p><p>Next year, Amazon plans to bring these updated models to the U.K. and Germany.</p><p>These Kindle Scribes, when purchased, include a three-month subscription to Kindle Unlimited, bringing in even more AI-powered features, like "Ask this Book" for highlighting passages or sentences and receive answers about its potential story significance.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The president of marketing, innovations, and experience at T-Mobile, Mike Katz, said, "The response from the first two months of T-Satellite commercial service has blown us away. We started with just text messaging and text-to-911, and those capabilities alone have proven to be invaluable for wireless users."</p><p>Katz adds that the company is now looking to bring those same valuable connectivity experiences to users' favorite apps.</p><p>As a result, T-Mobile announced a new selection of "Satellite-ready apps" that have received support for satellite connectivity over its network. The following apps are now Satellite-ready over T-Mobile:</p><ul><li>T-Life (T-Satellite support)</li><li>AllTrails</li><li>AccuWeather</li><li>CalTopo</li><li>onX</li><li>X (formerly Twitter)</li><li>WhatsApp</li></ul><h2 id="off-grid-and-stress-free-2">Off-grid and stress free</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="ukASEdM24AxQ4KqGDVi4RV" name="t-mobile-t-satellite-ready-apps-android-ios" alt="T-Mobile's T-Satellite service is launching "Satellite-ready" apps, including WhatsApp, X (formerly Twitter), and more for off-grid use when a signal vanishes." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ukASEdM24AxQ4KqGDVi4RV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: T-Mobile)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When it comes to X, T-Mobile states its satellite connectivity network will keep you involved with the social media platform if you lose your cellular connection. Users can view posts, videos, GIFs, and more through T-Satellite. Additionally, users can "control when high-res media loads" to avoid overusing their data. For WhatsApp, T-Satellite customers can now start voice and video calls anywhere without a cell connection. Texting, sending pictures, and the like are possible, too.</p><p>Access to these apps for T-Satellite customers is rolling out for Android and iOS users today (Oct 1).</p><p>Consumers on T-Mobile business plans will find T-Satellite support for apps like DialPad, FLORIAN, MultiLine, and T-Mobile Direct Connect.</p><p>The press release to Android Central earlier today states, "T-Satellite is included on T-Mobile’s best plans and available to all other wireless users — even Verizon and AT&T customers — for $10/month."</p><p>T-Mobile's "Satellite-ready" apps are essentially getting an expansion with this update. When the satellite service first launched, the company supported off-grid use for apps like Google Messages, Find Hub, Pixel Weather, Apple Music, Weather, Fitness, Samsung's Weather app, and more. You could probably see those apps as more like the "core" of the matter, and what's rolling out now is an expansion of that sentiment.</p><p>T-Mobile <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/t-mobile/t-mobile-adds-mms-texting-t-satellite-network-test-reported">launched its T-Satellite service</a> on July 23 after an extensive testing period in which roughly 1.8 million users joined to help polish. Also in July, T-Mobile started roping in Samsung and Motorola users into its off-grid services with MMS texting support. Users without a signal could still send images, GIFS, and audio clips for certain devices at the time. There's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.t-mobile.com/coverage/satellite-phone-service">more that's worth knowing</a>, but it's all relatively straightforward when you get down to it.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The phone has a new design with a wider camera plateau that immediately grabs attention, and Apple switched to aluminum after dabbling in titanium for the last two years.</p><p>But what I like the most this year is that the iPhone 17 Pro is available in orange. That's the model I'm using, and it's delightful to use an iPhone in a vibrant color. Don't get me wrong; I enjoyed the Natural Titanium <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a> quite a bit, but the orange hue this year is eye-catching on an entirely different scale.</p><p>There are plenty of other upgrades; the iPhone 17 Pro gets the all-new A19 Pro silicon, and there's a new vapor cooling system that unlocks much better sustained performance. There's a bigger battery this generation as well, and better ingress protection.</p><p>The cameras are also overhauled, with the iPhone 17 Pro now touting a trio of 48MP modules along with a new 18MP selfie lens that switches orientation automatically — which is very cool.

The wide camera bar (err, plateau) distinguishes the iPhone 17 Pro from its predecessors, and the design is uncharacteristically bold. While the new design won't be to everyone's tastes, I love the styling, and the aluminum unibody gives the iPhone 17 Pro a much better presence than previous years.</p><p>The rectangular camera plateau isn't just for show; it houses a bulk of the internal components, which is an achievement in and of itself. In doing so, the iPhone 17 Pro gets a sizeable battery boost, and the difference is immediately noticeable. While I used Pro models in the past, I prefer using the Pro Max because of the bigger panel and all-day battery, but even on the Pro variant, I managed to get a day's worth of use.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5092px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="8WWZmZwfyXMHSwSSNVJ2Ui" name="Apple iPhone 17 Pro" alt="Apple iPhone 17 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8WWZmZwfyXMHSwSSNVJ2Ui.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5092" height="2868" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'm using the Indian variant of the iPhone 17 Pro, which has a nano-SIM slot.

I didn't see any problems with connectivity, and my iPhone 17 Pro had a rock-solid signal over cellular.</p><p>Interestingly, the phone uses Apple's own N1 silicon to enable Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6, and Thread connectivity.

On that note, you can easily adjust the look of the photos with Styles, and this year's Bright gets closest to what Android-based Chinese manufacturers manage to deliver. That's the mode I used by default, but there's extensive customizability in how your photos and videos look.</p><p>Low-light shots have plenty of detail and good color rendition, but they're not quite on par with what you get on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x200-ultra-review">X200 Ultra</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-ultra-review">Xiaomi 15 Ultra</a>, or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro.</a> It's a similar story with the auxiliary sensors; the wide-angle and tele lenses are great in their own right, but they just don't measure up to what Chinese brands are offering on their phones.</p><p>That said, the Pixel 17 Pro is going up against Samsung and Google, and in that context, it holds up admirably well. I still prefer the Pixel 10 Pro XL in most scenarios, and Google did a better job with its telephoto lens this year. However, the iPhone 17 Pro isn't behind by much, and that alone is a considerable upgrade from previous years. If you're coming from an older iPhone, you'll love the cameras on the iPhone 17 Pro.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-apple-iphone-17-pro-software"><span>Apple iPhone 17 Pro: Software</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="w9gGhB6SDgeiVKfnnzmZsi" name="Apple iPhone 17 Pro" alt="Apple iPhone 17 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/w9gGhB6SDgeiVKfnnzmZsi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>iOS 26 is the biggest UI overhaul in iPhone history, bringing a fresh new design to this year's phones. </strong></li><li><strong>The UI is modern and fun to use, and it has much better customization options. </strong></li></ul><p>It isn't just the hardware design that's different this year; the iPhone 17 Pro comes with iOS 16, introducing the new Liquid Glass interface. The UI feels cleaner and modern, and as someone who used Windows 7 for nearly four years, I love the transparency effects. Sure, it's not consistent and it affects usability at times, but it is a definite step up over the earlier UI, which was starting to look bland.</p><p>Apple's custom apps have all switched to the new interface, and the design feels cohesive. There are a few errant crashes that I haven't noticed in previous years, and inevitably, the interface has bugs, but the iOS 26.1 addresses this to an extent. There's much better customization, and I like that quite a bit — it was an area where iOS lagged behind Android in previous years.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="xT8aTTunkD6DnrPiLsmhti" name="Apple iPhone 17 Pro" alt="Apple iPhone 17 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xT8aTTunkD6DnrPiLsmhti.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="pZFL7kWqCVvwgKza4rmYBj" name="Apple iPhone 17 Pro" alt="Apple iPhone 17 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pZFL7kWqCVvwgKza4rmYBj.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>On the whole, iOS 26 feels modern but familiar at the same time.

If you don't need great auxiliary cameras, it is the model to get. The regular iPhone 17 finally comes with ProMotion tech, bringing the panel to 120Hz, and it has a new 48MP camera, allowing it to take better images and videos.</p><p>Then there's the iPhone Air. The ultra-thin device is in an entirely different league, and I didn't think I'd enjoy using it as much as I have. It doesn't have the best cameras, and the battery isn't anywhere as good as the iPhone 17 Pro, but it is cool in a way that no other phone can manage in 2025.</p><p>If you're looking at an Android alternative, I'd recommend the Pixel 10 Pro. Google's latest phone is iPhone-esque to such an extent that there isn't much of a difference between the two. You get much better AI features on the Pixel 10 Pro, and the cameras are better — particularly the tele lens.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-apple-iphone-17-pro-should-you-buy-it"><span>Apple iPhone 17 Pro: Should you buy it?</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5068px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="aPUMbpp4CGemyVe7qTANfi" name="Apple iPhone 17 Pro" alt="Apple iPhone 17 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aPUMbpp4CGemyVe7qTANfi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5068" height="2855" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>You should buy this if: </strong></p><ul><li>You're using an older iPhone</li><li>You want an iPhone with bold styling</li><li>You need the best cameras on an iPhone</li><li>You want an iPhone that's easy to hold and use</li><li>You need reliable battery life</li></ul><p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if: </strong></p><ul><li>You need a bigger panel</li><li>You want the best telephoto lens</li></ul><p>There really isn't much of a reason to upgrade phones year-on-year — we're well past that cycle.

The bold styling in and if itself is a big enough change that it will prove to be divisive, but I like what Apple did in this area.</p><p>Other than that, you get the usual upgrades: the iPhone 17 Pro is faster, lasts longer, takes better photos and videos, and feels better to hold in hand. It makes a strong case for itself if you're looking to upgrade to a new phone this year, while still feeling familiar enough that it isn't jarring.</p><p>Ultimately, the decision to buy the iPhone 17 Pro is down to your requirements; if you need the auxiliary cameras and like the new design, it is the way to go. But if you just need the basics, the iPhone 17 is a good choice this year, and the iPhone Air is outstanding in its own right. Essentially, you've got much more choice than previous years, and that's always a good thing.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="ca498710-3b62-4109-955c-1092fa4d58cc">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/egnTiinBmNpHDkPPfnMf5C.jpg' alt="The iPhone 17 Pro in Cosmic Orange in a white product render."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Apple iPhone 17 Pro</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The iPhone 17 Pro comes with a ton of useful upgrades, from the bold new design to standout cameras, and a bigger battery.

The company announced that Daniel Ek, Spotify’s founder and CEO, will step aside from the CEO role and become Executive Chairman starting January 1, 2026.</p><p>In his new capacity, Ek plans to remain deeply involved as an active strategist overseeing long-term direction, capital allocation, regulatory issues, and key decisions.</p><p>Why now? According to Ek, it’s because the two executives already running much of the day-to-day are ready to take formal control.</p><p>Spotify is handing over the CEO reins to Gustav Söderström (formerly chief product and technology officer) and Alex Norström (formerly chief business officer). They will become co-CEOs, reporting to Ek and (pending shareholder approval) joining Spotify’s board of directors.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">streaming platform</a> says this is not a major change. It is simply making official what has already been happening since about 2023, when Söderström and Norström started leading strategy and operations.</p><p>In its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2025-09-30/spotify-announcement-daniel-ek-executive-chairman/" target="_blank">announcement</a>, Spotify calls the new setup a 'European chairman' model, meaning Ek will stay involved, unlike the more distant role of a typical U.S. board chair.</p><p>In a joint statement, the incoming co-CEOs emphasized their long cooperation at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/switching-from-youtube-music-to-spotify">Spotify</a> and their commitment to maintaining momentum.</p><h2 id="controversy-in-the-mix-2">Controversy in the mix</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nS4bjbyKmiSYtyq4VFAYJF" name="Spotify-lifestyle.jpeg" alt="Spotify Premium on an Android phone." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nS4bjbyKmiSYtyq4VFAYJF.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A layer of controversy shadows the timing. Ek’s involvement via his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/17/spotifys-daniel-ek-leads-investment-in-defense-startup-helsing.html" target="_blank">investment firm Prima Materia</a> in the defense tech company Helsing (with a €600 million backing) has stirred backlash in the music community.</p><p>Several artists, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/massive-attack-is-the-latest-group-to-leave-streaming-platforms-in-anti-war-protest/" target="_blank">including Massive Attack</a>, Deerhoof, and others, have pulled their catalogs from Spotify, citing ethical concerns about supporting military tech.</p><p>Though Spotify and the Board maintain this leadership realignment was in planning for years, critics suggest that the move may also be a reaction to reputational pressure.</p><p>Still, Spotify today is not a small startup. It operates across 184 markets, supports over 700 million users, and claims leadership in streaming.</p><p>Ek stressed that Spotify’s first full year of profitability has arrived, and that the business is stable and capable of this transition.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Consumers will notice that this year's Echo products have received a complete redesign. Starting with the first-ever Echo Dot Max, Amazon states this new device brings roughly three times more bass compared to its previous Echo Dot 5th Gen.</p><p>This product has received a two-way speaker system with a "high-excursion" woofer for deeper bass and crispy highs. While this compact speaker still embodies what Amazon intends for the Echo Dot series (now in Max), there's a lot inside that consumers don't see, which is pushing it further ahead.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1065px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.34%;"><img id="eCD44cpXocRk4ytgND2JWJ" name="amazon-echo-dot-max-render" alt="The Amazon Echo Dot Max is the first of its kind for the company, bringing in a more conversational Alexa experience, richer sounds, and better microphones." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eCD44cpXocRk4ytgND2JWJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1065" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Amazon)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Internally, the Echo Dot Max, like the rest of the newly launched products, features Amazon's custom silicon chip. For the Max specifically, the post states it features the new AZ3 chip for "better conversation detection." This chip pushes the Dot Max to sift out background noise, so your natural conversations with Alexa Plus remain crystal clear.</p><p>While <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/amazon-announces-alexa-plus">Alexa Plus</a> is there for whatever your query is, Amazon announced that preparing to launch the Alexa Plus Store.

Amazon states it's trying to balance a device that fits seamlessly into your living space, while also providing rich, powerful sound, no matter where you put it in the room.</p><p>It offers the same woofer as the Dot Max; however, its specifications mention that the Echo Studio also supports spatial audio and Dolby Atmos. The newest Studio really zeroes in on delivering immersive sounds for homeowners, as it sports a spherical design this time with a knit-fabric covering, which Amazon says contributes to its "ultimate acoustic transparency."</p><p>Inside the Studio, Amazon placed its custom AZ3 Pro chip, which takes the audio capabilities of the standard AZ3 even higher.</p><p>The audio potential for the Echo Studio strives for new heights when paired with other Studio devices or the new Dot Max (up to five). When connected to a "compatible" Fire TV Stick, users can activate Alexa Home Theater and let the AI facilitate that cinema-quality sound you're looking for. Amazon states consumers will also find these products in its Alexa Home Theater bundles.</p><p>The Echo Studio starts at $219, and its pre-orders are live (November 15 rollout).</p><h2 id="putting-on-a-echo-show-2">Putting on a (Echo) Show</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1073px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.92%;"><img id="uowSrQpqjCtLCaZDJGebKE" name="amazon-echo-show-8-11-render" alt="The new Amazon Echo Show 8 and 11 offers varying display sizes, new screens, more information, and an enhanced Alexa Plus experience for any task." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uowSrQpqjCtLCaZDJGebKE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1073" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Amazon)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Amazon's Echo Show models feature a screen, which only enhances the smart home experience, but this year's pair, the Show 8 and 11, are looking to do more with AI. The post highlights the Show 8 and 11's in-cell touch and "negative liquid crystal design" for an improved visual screen experience. Inside, the AZ3 Pro chip is there, as well as Amazon's Omnisense technology.</p><p>Leveraging the Show 8 and 11's 13MP camera, Omnisense delivers a new world of ambient AI, as the devices can act depending on what's happening in your home. If you've set a reminder for someone and that person happens to walk by, the Show 8 and 11 will show it to them. Alexa is also said to "greet you" when you walk up to these newest Show models.</p><p>The upgraded screens for the Show 8 and 11 give users even more information when Alexa surfaces their favorite content.</p><p>For entertainment, Amazon says these models sport a new "media control center" for browsing music, podcasts, and books in their own dedicated places. Alexa Plus adds a Shopping widget, which monitors and tracks your deliveries and more from Amazon, Whole Foods, and Amazon Fresh. Tapping the display or asking Alexa to surface details about your orders is possible. Alexa is even there, ready to answer questions about gift recommendations for people.</p><p>There's a notable update with the Show 8 and 11's Health & Wellness features, and that's the inclusion of Oura. Amazon states that it's working with Oura, enabling users to connect their accounts, so Alexa can provide "personalized suggestions like getting in a quick workout based on your schedule." Home Organization helps users manage calendar schedules, while Alexa Plus Home is your one-stop shop for everything smart home, like your Ring camera feeds.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://a.co/d/dhN3XZt">Echo Show 8</a> starts at $179, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://a.co/d/iVhFMyL">Show 11</a> runs for $219.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The company initially planned to launch only the Galaxy S26 Pro, Galaxy S26 Edge, and Galaxy S26 Ultra, but with sluggish Galaxy S25 Edge sales, it seems Samsung has revived development of the Plus model.</p><p>If accurate, this would mean the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26 lineup</a> could once again include four models. For comparison, Samsung planned production of about 300,000 Galaxy S25 Edge units between September and December 2025, while producing nearly 500,000 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-vs-galaxy-s25-plus">Galaxy S25 Plus</a> units in the same timeframe — even though the Plus itself has sold less impressively than the standard Galaxy S25 and Galaxy S25 Ultra.</p><p>Still, it looks like Samsung is reconsidering its strategy for the Galaxy S26 lineup. The Galaxy S26 Plus could be a valuable option for users who don't want the slim design of the Galaxy S26 Edge but still want a large display and telephoto lens. And in the end, more competition is always better.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This component is designed specifically for the math and data handling required by artificial intelligence and machine learning models, making it significantly different from standard phone hardware, such as the CPU and standard GPU.</p><p>It works with the "normal" phone hardware to transform lines of code into something that appears to think or be intelligent. It's also <em>very</em> different.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Feature</p></th><th  ><p>NPU</p></th><th  ><p>Standard CPU or GPU</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Primary Function: </strong></p></td><td  ><p>Optimized for neural network computation, machine learning, and deep learning tasks like matrix multiplications or convolutions.</p></td><td  ><p><strong>CPU:</strong> Handles general-purpose, sequential tasks.</p><p><strong>GPU:</strong> Handles graphics rendering and massive, but simple, parallel computations.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Architecture: </strong></p></td><td  ><p>Built for massively parallel processing of low-precision 8-bit or 16-bit arithmetic.</p></td><td  ><p><strong>CPU:</strong> Optimized for complex instructions at a high clock with and low latency.</p><p><strong>GPU:</strong> Optimized for 32-bit floating-point math common in graphics.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Power Efficiency:</strong></p></td><td  ><p>Extremely power-efficient for AI tasks, allowing complex AI (like real-time translation or image generation) to run on the battery for longer.</p></td><td  ><p><strong>CPU/GPU:</strong> Can run AI tasks, but are significantly less power-efficient and slower than an NPU for the same task, draining the battery much faster while taking longer to do it.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Performance Measurement: </strong></p></td><td  ><p><strong>TOPS</strong> (Tera Operations Per Second).

Without one, AI processing on an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> (or any device, for that matter) will be significantly slower, consume more battery, and likely require an internet connection and a remote AI server to function. Chip makers have their own brand of NPU: Google has the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-tensor-g5">Tensor Core</a>, Apple has the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apples-a19-pro-throws-down-the-gauntlet-for-qualcomm-and-mediatek">Neural Engine</a>, Qualcomm has the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Hexagon NPU</a>, and so on. They all do the same things slightly differently.</p><p>However, you also need standard phone hardware to bring everything together and enable faster and more efficient AI processing.</p><p>The CPU manages and coordinates the entire system. For AI, it handles the initial setup of the data pipeline, and for some smaller, simpler models, it may execute the AI task itself, albeit less efficiently than the NPU.</p><p>The GPU can accelerate some AI tasks, especially those related to image and video processing, as its parallel architecture is well-suited for repetitive, simple calculations. In a <strong>heterogeneous architecture</strong> (utilizing multiple processor components on a single chip), the system can select the most suitable component (NPU, GPU, or CPU) for a specific AI workload.</p><p>AI models, especially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gcd-2024-google-ai-tested-llm-chatbots-with-werewolf">large language models</a> (LLMs) used for generative AI, require a large amount of fast RAM (Random Access Memory) to store the entire model and the data it's actively processing. Modern flagship phones have increased RAM to support these larger, more capable on-device AI models.</p><h2 id="why-this-matters-2">Why this matters</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="qfhgRE4cbo6gDd98HUwdMd" name="google-gemini-claude-chatgpt-samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-google-pixel-9-pro-fold" alt="Gemini 2.5 Pro on the Galaxy Chromebook Plus, ChatGPT on the Galaxy Z Fold 6, Claude on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qfhgRE4cbo6gDd98HUwdMd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For fast and efficient AI ("good" AI is subjective), what you really need is optimization.

Despite my hoard of options, I've ended up sticking with Garmin's most unique watch of the year, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-venu-x1-review">Venu X1</a>, for hundreds of miles of marathon training.</p><p>Long-time Garmin fans looked askance at the eight-day battery life and squircle design, but I found myself instantly accustomed to its feathery, comfortable fit and the ultra-bright 2-inch display for seeing data more clearly at a glance during workouts. The only thing that truly made it hard to recommend was the high price tag.</p><p>Now that Garmin has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Lightweight-Smartwatch-Advanced-Features-ComfortFit/dp/B0FCYHNL3C"><strong>discounted the Venu X1 by $100</strong></a> for its birthday sale, it's a more reasonable upgrade to the new $549 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-4-vs-venu-3">Venu 4</a>, and anyone sick of Garmin watches' bulky aesthetic should give it serious consideration.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/primebigdealdays"><em><strong>Prime Day returns October 7th - see the full list of deals</strong></em></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="66872d8d-5d6a-453b-8561-4c24a84943fd" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Forerunner 970" data-dimension48="Forerunner 970" data-dimension25="$699.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/Lightweight-Smartwatch-Advanced-Features-ComfortFit/dp/B0FCYHNL3C" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="YPdCZ7m4g99urshSyncAJ3" name="garmin-venu-x1-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YPdCZ7m4g99urshSyncAJ3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>The Garmin Venu X1 has an Apple Watch Ultra-esque look but weighs a full ounce less and lasts over a week instead of a couple of days. It has the software tools of a <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-970-review" data-dimension112="66872d8d-5d6a-453b-8561-4c24a84943fd" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Forerunner 970" data-dimension48="Forerunner 970" data-dimension25="$699.99">Forerunner 970</a> — from training load and running tolerance to real-time stamina and hiking/ golf maps — but again, you'll barely notice it on your wrist until you need information.</p><p>Even at $100 off, it's still expensive for a smartwatch. But it may be a <em>long</em> time before we see a better deal on such a new model, and it'll save you hundreds compared to a bulky <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Fenix 8</a>.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Lightweight-Smartwatch-Advanced-Features-ComfortFit/dp/B0FCYHNL3C" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="66872d8d-5d6a-453b-8561-4c24a84943fd" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Forerunner 970" data-dimension48="Forerunner 970" data-dimension25="$699.99">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You already know the Garmin ecosystem well enough to drop serious cash on <em>any</em> premium model; you're a self-guided athlete who wants Garmin's best training insights; and you care about comfort and eye strain as much as battery life.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You can't responsibly spend this much on any smartwatch; you need a Fenix or Instinct that'll last for a 100-mile race or multi-day hike; or you don't work out enough to take full advantage of Garmin's tools.</p><p>Out of all the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">best Garmin watches</a>, you'll rarely find one this light; those that are, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-vivoactive-6-review">Vivoactive 6</a>, have tiny displays and much more limited features. Because the Venu X1 display doesn't cut off its corners for a traditional rounded look, you get much more topographical detail on maps, with more room for buttons and menus that don't block your view. And otherwise, your watch faces and widgets are much larger, fitting more details on the screen.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="bmHBn8FrjesbKiyv8DW2MC" name="Garmin-Venu-X1-maps" alt="The Garmin Venu X1 (left) and Garmin Forerunner 970 (right) sitting aside each other on a lawn, both showing the same 9-mile hiking course, but the larger, square-shaped X1 display shows much more map info." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bmHBn8FrjesbKiyv8DW2MC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That said, the Venu X1 isn't perfect, and you may end up deciding that you'd rather buy the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-4-makes-major-changes-to-garmins-health-and-fitness-coaching-and-were-intrigued">Venu 4</a> at full price for about $150 less.</p><p>The Venu 4 may not have maps, sapphire crystal protection, or premium running and cycling tools like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-forerunner-970-running-tolerance-tool-too-useful-to-be-premium-feature">running tolerance</a> or Hill/ Endurance scores. But it does beat the Venu X1 with dual-band GPS and ECG readings, along with an extra 2–4 days of battery life. And it offers the same mic & speaker, flashlight, and training load data.</p><p>The problem, of course, is that the Venu 4 45mm weighs about half an ounce more while showing less data. It's still lighter than your typical smartwatch, and everyday Garmin fans probably won't mind.

Likewise, your Galaxy or Pixel Watch has the new appeal of constant Gemini access on your wrist. Now that I've tested both, I wanted to do a quick, candid breakdown of what each experience offers and which will be more useful to you.</p><p>I'm <em>not</em> comparing smartwatches and smart glasses' general value, nor trying to say whether <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/gemini">Gemini</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-ai-is-evolving-again-and-its-resurrecting-the-metaverse">Meta AI</a> is "smarter."

But Gemini offers email summaries, smart home controls, Maps reviews, and better communication <em>between</em> apps, like pasting Search results into a message or a Keep reminder.</p><h2 id="neither-is-the-perfect-form-for-ai-2">Neither is the 'perfect' form for AI</h2><p>Gemini on Wear OS provides you with AI insights, offering better battery life, comfort, and power than smart glasses can reasonably provide.

However, the hardware has a long way to go, and you may encounter more pushback from wearing cameras on your face.</p><p>Both of these AI form factors overlap, but I think they're specialized (and limited) enough that neither will be the <em>definitive</em> way to use AI anytime soon. Heck, I'm sure many people will continue to use their phones' AI apps. But it should be exciting to watch both new AI form factors improve with time.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It's not hyperbole to say this is a game-changer, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1idr6j6/call_screening_is_a_game_changer/">as so many</a> Reddit <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1ggsaer/ai_call_screening_is_very_underrated/">users point out</a>.</p><p>Since its inception, Google has expanded these capabilities to include caller ID and spam filtering, scam detection, call screening, voice translation, and features such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-call-notes-google-pixel">Call Notes</a>, Take a Message, Hold for Me, Direct My Call, and Audio Emojis.

I'm talking about Frequent Faces, a feature you need to enable in the camera settings and one that ensures pictures of your favorite people and pets come out crisp every time.</p><p>Frequent Faces builds upon what Google built in Google Photos many years ago. Your Pixel will recognize the faces of people and pets you most often take photos of and locally store that data for reference. When you take future photos of these people or pets, the Pixel camera software understands that these faces should be prioritized in the shot.</p><p>This lets you capture a crisp photo of your 2-year-old while they're running around in the evening, whereas other phones might just capture a blurry image. It's yet another passive AI-based capability that I find incredibly useful on Pixel phones, and something no other phone can do.</p><h2 id="pixel-recorder-2">Pixel Recorder</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="MfAcxVgjatpbQ5JwPPWSVW" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-pixel-recorder-singing" alt="Recording myself singing on the Google Recorder app on a Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MfAcxVgjatpbQ5JwPPWSVW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Of all the dedicated Pixel apps on the phone, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/how-use-pixel-recorder-app">Pixel Recorder</a> is my most used. It's no surprise, given my profession — journalism requires a lot of recording, logging, and note-taking — and Pixel Recorder has been one of my all-time favorite apps since its launch on the Pixel 4.</p><p>Many phones have built-in audio recorders that can transcribe the audio, but the Pixel's is still the best for several reasons. First, transcription quality is better than any other phone or app I've tried. Even services like Otter don't perform quite as well, and all of these transcriptions happen <em>locally</em> on your phone. Plus, the recordings and transcripts are automatically backed up to your Google account.</p><p>Speaker labels are automatically created, and you can quickly thumb through the automatically-generated summary or search for anything in the recording that you want to find. Plus, Pixel 10 updates add music generation capabilities, so if you're someone who often catches a tune playing in their head and wants to turn it into a legit song, Pixel Recorder can help you do that.</p><h2 id="pixel-screenshots-2">Pixel Screenshots</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="L2RZdXEgB35fu4c9sB6tbW" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-pixel-screenshots" alt="Organizing screenshots with the Pixel Screenshots app on a Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/L2RZdXEgB35fu4c9sB6tbW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'm someone who takes <em>a lot</em> of screenshots.

DJI is probably the most famous name in this segment, but other brands like Hohem, Joby, and OBSBOT do pretty well for themselves, too.</p><p>Hohem just launched a new AI-ready gimbal that has two of the best features seen in DJI gimbals — AI tracking and advanced remote controls. The Hohem iSteady V3 Ultra doesn't just offer your average run-of-the-mill person tracking features, though. It takes things to the next level.</p><p>As for the detachable remote, it has a touchscreen with a joystick and two buttons. The touchscreen remote shows the live feed from the AI camera. It attaches to the Hohem iSteady V3 Ultra gimbal magnetically, charging wirelessly while docked.</p><p>I spent a good few weeks trying out the iSteady V3 Ultra with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review">Pixel 10 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a>, and various other phones, and I truly believe this is the future of all premium-grade gimbals going forward.</p><h2 id="the-hohem-isteady-v3-ultra-gimbal-has-an-advanced-ai-tracker-with-gestures-for-several-commands-2">The Hohem iSteady V3 Ultra gimbal has an advanced AI-tracker with gestures for several commands</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2027px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="gYzoByAtsBpshWkyzTXUY7" name="Hohem-iSteady-V3-Ultra-lifestyle-18" alt="Hohem iSteady V3 Ultra gimbal" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gYzoByAtsBpshWkyzTXUY7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2027" height="1140" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The little white rectangle is the AI module of the Hohem iSteady V3 Ultra gimbal. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The AI-tracker on the Hohem iSteady V3 Ultra gimbal is probably the most complex one on the market. The AI module has a flashlight and a 2MP camera lens, and it can be detached and manually turned on or off. You can detach and reattach it to be front or rear facing, depending on which camera you're using to shoot photos or videos in the moment. The flashlight has three color modes: 6500K (Cool light), 5000K (Neutral light), and 2700K (Warm light).</p><p>You can track people, pets, and even objects with the AI tracker. This can be done automatically or manually through the touchscreen remote, by dragging to select the subject on the tiny screen. Once the target is locked in, the gimbal smoothly swivels and tilts to keep it in view. Since the gimbal has a three-axis stabilization design, even if you walk or run while shooting a video of the subject being tracked, the movements are extremely smooth and stable.</p><p>I did face some issues when the object being tracked disappeared from view completely; the gimbal goes berserk trying to find its target. There's a learning curve to it that takes a few tries and experimentation to figure out.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Hjyc7YHyRG7vUUVMbJfey7" name="Hohem-iSteady-V3-Ultra-lifestyle-1" alt="Hohem iSteady V3 Ultra gimbal" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Hjyc7YHyRG7vUUVMbJfey7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Gestures are the highlight of the iSteady V3 Ultra gimbal's AI features. You can use hand gestures to command the iSteady V3 Ultra to change orientation. For instance, pointing upwards with both hands while it's looking at you, even while recording, immediately changes the orientation from landscape to portrait.</p><p>Other gesture commands apart from changing orientation include starting or stopping AI tracking, capturing a photo, initiating or finishing video recording, and customizing your camera composition. This allows the gimbal to track your movements, rotating up to 360 degrees, without you being in the center of the camera's viewpoint. For example, you could choose to place the object being tracked as per the rule of thirds.</p><p>Of all these features, I struggled to get the camera composition feature to work most times. The rest work well; however, none of them are as effective in darker lighting. The AI camera struggles to recognize the shape your hands form without sufficient light. There is also a proximity limit, requiring you to be between 0.5m and 5m away for gesture recognition.</p><h2 id="the-setup-process-is-as-straightforward-as-it-can-be-2">The setup process is as straightforward as it can be</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WjXkKtECRv7vVZ28w3nQC8" name="Hohem-iSteady-V3-Ultra-lifestyle-15" alt="Hohem iSteady V3 Ultra gimbal" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WjXkKtECRv7vVZ28w3nQC8.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="n6mxTtj5zs8sfMJzhLrv98" name="Hohem-iSteady-V3-Ultra-lifestyle-17" alt="Hohem iSteady V3 Ultra gimbal" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n6mxTtj5zs8sfMJzhLrv98.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="dFoyVcVtMotU9Wk2NGRh88" name="Hohem-iSteady-V3-Ultra-lifestyle-16" alt="Hohem iSteady V3 Ultra gimbal" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dFoyVcVtMotU9Wk2NGRh88.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Setting up the Hohem iSteady V3 Ultra gimbal is not difficult.

Even the little legs tucked into the base of the gimbal are extremely stable and feel durable.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WxNutuLd7TpoBr58zAWEr7" name="Hohem-iSteady-V3-Ultra-lifestyle-13" alt="Hohem iSteady V3 Ultra gimbal" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WxNutuLd7TpoBr58zAWEr7.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="B3EGnw5RafvCF4bzo4nfo7" name="Hohem-iSteady-V3-Ultra-lifestyle-14" alt="Hohem iSteady V3 Ultra gimbal" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B3EGnw5RafvCF4bzo4nfo7.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3542px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="g5ipDjQkwvtW7Rv5vijEk7" name="Hohem-iSteady-V3-Ultra-lifestyle-11" alt="Hohem iSteady V3 Ultra gimbal" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/g5ipDjQkwvtW7Rv5vijEk7.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3542" height="1993" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>There's a standard quarter-inch tripod thread at the base of the iSteady V3 Ultra gimbal, so you can screw it into any tripod if the built-in 8-inch extension pole isn't long enough for you.</p><p>Hohem delivers a nine-hour uptime from the gimbal's 1,600mAh battery. Constantly using the AI module and the flashlight significantly dips this uptime, though I found that the flashlight is the main culprit here.

DJI has the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/DJI-6941565997517-Osmo-Mobile-Gimbal/dp/B07FTG84SW" target="_blank">Osmo Mobile 7P</a> priced at $149, which comes close, but its detachable remote does not have a touchscreen with a live camera feed on it.</p><p>There's also the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/OBSBOT-AI-Powered-Auto-Tracking-Wide-Angle-Streaming/dp/B099WYPVHF/">OBSBOT Me</a>, an AI-powered gimbal that tracks the subject. It also has gesture controls, but there's no remote control. Yet, the OBSBOT Me gimbal still costs a whopping $144.</p><p>Having used gimbals from all three brands, I can say that they match the same level of quality and function. All three gimbals are fabulous for content capture and creation. While DJI has the smoothest performance, it lacks the live feed feature of the remote and templates offered by the Hohem iSteady V3 Ultra gimbal.</p><p>While the Hohem iSteady V3 Ultra is not perfect just yet, this gimbal perfectly illustrates how AI is transforming all sorts of products in consumer tech, not just phones and smart home equipment. For $169, this is an outstanding product that matches the needs of various media professionals and amateurs alike. I especially recommend this to beginners who are not yet experienced enough to invest in more advanced gear.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="f94c18ff-994f-4896-bd2d-8c3162644475">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gzbPBUsUVhQEs7yG9djDRR.jpg' alt="Hohem iSteady V3 Ultra"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Hohem iSteady V3 Ultra</div>                                <div class="stars__reviews"><span itemprop="reviewRating" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Rating" class="chunk rating"><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><meta itemprop="bestRating" content="100.0" /><meta itemprop="worstRating" content="0.0" /><meta itemprop="ratingValue" content="80" /></span></div>                </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The future of gimbals?</strong></em></p><p>The Hohem iSteady V3 Ultra is a unique gimbal that uses AI tracking to keep your phone's camera in frame and to change the camera orientation via gestures.

Here in October, Google's kicking off the spooky month by introducing Gemini for Home, a new range of smart home devices with its AI model woven directly into the core of every single product. These new cameras, a Nest Cam Indoor (3rd Gen), Nest Cam Outdoor (2nd Gen), and a Nest Doorbell (3rd Gen), offer an experience you'll find familiar, but greatly enhanced by upgraded hardware and Gemini.</p><p>Internally, Gemini's at the heart, and Google says you'll find new capabilities thanks to its multimodal software, like more detailed alerts from home.</p><p>The press release states users will "get the full picture" behind every alert and "see important moments up close with a zoomed-in video preview." In the app, users will find that they're scrolling less through their video history. Leveraging "Ask Home," users can ask the AI a specific question like, "What happened to the vase in the living room?" Google states the AI will produce a description of what happened, as well as a video for proof.</p><p>Additionally, within the app's Home Brief, users will receive a summary of every event that may have happened while they were away without hopping from video to video.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:900px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="VDpryrWxWZW4R5bFHAZ6Kf" name="google-nest-gemini-doorbell-hazel" alt="The new Google Nest Doorbell (3rd Gen) in hazel up against a door." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VDpryrWxWZW4R5bFHAZ6Kf.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="900" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:71.43%;"><img id="AAMvEAZQs3mFiLadcrnsAf" name="google-home-nest-outdoor-camera-hazel-wall-mounted-side" alt="The new Google Nest Outdoor camera, mounted on a wall in its hazel color option." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AAMvEAZQs3mFiLadcrnsAf.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="840" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>On a hardware level,  Google states all three cameras have been upgraded with 2K HDR video capabilities. Joining that is a wider, taller aspect ratio for videos. The post states the new Nest Cams grab 152-degree diagonal viewing, while the Doorbell sees an upgraded 1:1 aspect ratio and 166-degree diagonal viewing, giving homeowners a much fuller picture of anything going on in or around their home.</p><p>Lastly, Google states it's improved the low-light performance, so users will find richer colors and details in darker scenarios.</p><p>User privacy is a big deal, especially for cameras that are so personal. Google states the newest cameras have their videos encrypted, and there's two-step verification using your Google Account. Moreover, users will notice a green light on their cameras, informing them when it's processing or streaming video.</p><p>Without worrying about a subscription, Google states the newest Nest cameras provide a zoom and crop-out feature, so you can focus on what matters in any given event. The built-in "intelligent alerts" for identifying people, vehicles, animals, and more are included without extra cost (a subscription). What's more, homeowners receive "video history included," meaning you can go back and see what's going on from six hours ago, instead of three.</p><p>The new Nest Cams and Doorbell are launching today (Oct 1) on the Google Store and "major retailers." In Snow, Hazel, and Berry, the Nest Cam Indoor starts at $99.99. Available in Snow and Hazel, the Nest Cam Outdoor starts at $149.99. Finally, debuting in Snow, hazel, and Linen, the new Nest Doorbell starts at $179.99.</p><p>The Indoor and Outdoor cams will hit markets in the U.S., Canada, Australia, Japan, the U.K., Ireland, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Switzerland, Austria, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland. The Doorbell will only arrive in the U.S. and Canada, presumably, for now.</p><h2 id="a-conversational-google-home-speaker-2">A conversational Google Home Speaker</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:712px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:84.27%;"><img id="NPioYGGXQqEC3DL7QqJntA" name="google-home-gemini-speaker-black-kitchen-example" alt="The new Google Home Speaker in black, sitting on a counter top with a model standing beside it, holding a mug." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NPioYGGXQqEC3DL7QqJntA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="712" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That new Nest Indoor camera isn't the only product arriving with Gemini for your home. Truly surging ahead in the "Gemini for Home" era is the new Google Home Speaker that's reportedly "engineered for Gemini." At its core, Gemini is what makes this Speaker, as the post states, the product is designed for "natural conversations." The new Home Speaker has been outfitted with "custom processing" to handle any task you give it with fluidity.</p><p>Rounding its rounder design is a circular ring light right beneath it. Google says this light is there for visual feedback, so you know when Gemini is listening, "reasoning," responding to your question, or in "Gemini Live Mode."</p><p>Consumers will find the new Speaker produces 360-degree audio and a long-requested feature: the ability to pair two Google Home Speakers with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/the-google-tv-streamer-launch">Google TV Streamer</a>. Google teases that users can use two Speakers can turn their living spaces into a little home theater, if they'd like. Existing features, such as grouping multiple Nest speakers for multi-room music enjoyment, remain.</p><p>Users can physically mute the Google Home Speaker with its mic toggle on its frame.</p><p>The Google Home Speaker will debut in Porcelain, Hazel, Jade, and Berry. However, consumers will not see this product launch with the other Nest cameras previously highlighted. Google states that it wants to roll out Gemini for Home in early access for its device ecosystem <em>before </em>introducing the next big thing. As a result, the Google Home speaker will not launch until Spring 2026, but when it does, you'll find it for $99.</p><p>Consumers in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Belgium, Switzerland, Austria, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand are on deck to receive it next year.</p><h2 id="coming-to-walmart-2">Coming to Walmart</h2><p>While Google is announcing its new Gemini for Home era, the company is also drawing awareness to an expansion, which brings Walmart's onn series into the mix. Google states it is partnering with Walmart to bring the new onn Indoor Camera Wired and onn Video Doorbell Wired devices to consumers today (Oct 1). You'll find 1080p resolution, Gemini's intelligent event alerts, and more, all through the Google Home app. However, it's worth mentioning that you'll need a Google Home Premium subscription for these features.</p><p>The Indoor Wired starts at $22.96, while the Outdoor Wired goes for $49.86 at Walmart across the U.S.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Along with introducing AI to its smart home ecosystem, Google has also unveiled a completely redesigned Google Home app for Android and iOS, bringing several meaningful changes and useful features.</p><p>Google says it rebuilt the Home app with three main goals in mind: to make it "faster, more reliable, and complete." The company explained that to integrate Gemini into the Home app, the app first needed to feel faster and more dependable — something the old version had been lacking for a long time.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hyGSHwjTtZQWniVYvojdyT" name="google-home-app-new-1" alt="New Google Home app with Gemini built-in" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hyGSHwjTtZQWniVYvojdyT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>According to Google, the new Home app is now "significantly faster," loading up to 70% quicker on some Android devices. The company says it has fixed many long-standing bugs, while features like Live Views in the camera section now load 30% faster with a 40% drop in playback failures. With this update, Google claims the app should feel much more "resilient and responsive."</p><p>In addition to speed and stability, Google says the new "foundation" allowed it to integrate Nest devices directly into the Home app, creating a unified hub for both <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-home">Google Home</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/im-done-buying-google-nest-products">Nest products</a>. The app now supports all core Nest devices, including every Nest Thermostat since 2015, as well as older Nest cams and doorbells.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bhjN8cfZ8tMWN97LiBKC8U" name="google-home-app-new-3" alt="New Google Home app with Gemini built-in" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bhjN8cfZ8tMWN97LiBKC8U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> is also now built directly into the new Google Home app. The interface has been simplified into three tabs: Home, Activity, and Automations. The Home tab still lets you access all of your devices, but new swipe gestures make it easier to move between Favorites, all devices, and dashboards.</p><p>The Activity tab is where Gemini integration really shines. It provides a canonical history of everything happening in your home across both first- and third-party devices. It also introduces a new feature called "Home Brief," which gives you a quick daily summary of things with your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-google-home-compatible-devices">smart home devices</a>. However, Home Brief requires a Google Home Premium subscription.</p><p>The Automations tab shows upcoming automations linked to your devices, while the company has also given the automation editor much-needed improvements. You can now simply tap the "Help me create" button in the editor section and type what you want, and Gemini will automatically generate the automation for you.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VkNzr8mcNwPvmU6uT9AenT" name="google-home-app-new-2" alt="New Google Home app with Gemini built-in" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VkNzr8mcNwPvmU6uT9AenT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="google-home-app-with-gemini-is-now-rolling-out-2">Google Home app with Gemini is now rolling out</h2><p>Other new features in the app include double-tap gestures in camera views to fast-forward or rewind, just like in YouTube. Gemini also adds more context to alerts, so instead of generic notifications like "person detected," it can provide details such as "Robin walking with flowers."</p><p>The most important addition, though, is the new Ask Home feature, accessible from the app's persistent header navigation. Ask Home is everything you expect the Gemini integration to be. It can help you perform as simple tasks as finding specific devices, but it can also help with other complex tasks like creating automations, locating a specific video recording, or even controlling multiple devices at once.</p><p>The new Google Home app is rolling out starting today (Oct. 1) and should reach your device soon. Alongside the revamped app, Google also announced a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/gemini-for-home-is-here-new-nest-cameras-ai-home-speaker-debut">lineup of new smart home devices</a> to expand the ecosystem.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The latest collection features high-performance ceramic, giving it a look that literally resembles wearing a ceramic ring on your finger, rather than a smart ring.</p><p>As much as it looks like it's made of glass, the new Oura Ring 4 Ceramic retains the same advanced health tracking capabilities of the original Oura Ring 4. The ring maker seems to be chasing some nostalgic mood ring vibes with this collection.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="WT7PN9A3HygFbNiDj7Vgk6" name="Oura-Ring-4-ceramic" alt="Oura Ring 4 ceramic collection is here" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WT7PN9A3HygFbNiDj7Vgk6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3240" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Oura)</span></figcaption></figure><p>"By merging tradition with innovation and pairing it with the most advanced technology, we’ve created a ring that is as sophisticated in its design as it is in function—refined, enduring, and distinctive. Our goal is to make this wearable technology as beautiful and expressive as the jewelry we cherish," said Miklu Silvanto, chief design officer at ŌURA</p><p>As for the ring's dimensions, it measures 7.9mm in width, similar to the Oura Ring 4; however, the new collection is significantly thicker, measuring 3.51mm due to the zirconia ceramic material on the ring, which maintains the ring's color, luster, and durability.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="GVzKg7iM98vDBLsdkxdDg6" name="Oura-Ring-4-ceramic" alt="Oura Ring 4 ceramic collection is here" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GVzKg7iM98vDBLsdkxdDg6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3240" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Oura)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The ring's weight varies anywhere between 5.1 and 8.1 grams based on the size of the smart ring. The Ceramic collection comes in four colors: Tide(green), Petal (pink), Cloud (white), and Midnight (dark blue). Additionally, Oura adds that since the color on each of these rings is inherent to the material and isn't a surface coating, it is said to "keep its richness throughout its life."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.64%;"><img id="ZY5gyHhU4CTuG8roUSYqTC" name="Oura-Ring-4-ceramic" alt="Oura Ring 4 Ceramic is here" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZY5gyHhU4CTuG8roUSYqTC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1280" height="853" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Oura)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Despite being durable, this ring can get some scuffs from softer metals, like a dumbbell, when lifting weights. Oura says that these grey marks are metal transfers and are reversible. With each of these ceramic rings, users get a Ceramic Polishing Pad to wipe these marks and restore their ring's shine.</p><p>With this launch, the company says users can switch seamlessly between multiple rings within a single account without having to go through the hassle of syncing the data on the app. "Whether switching for a workout or matching an outfit, the transition is simple, ensuring uninterrupted health tracking across Oura Ring devices," the press release added.</p><p>The Oura Ring 4 Ceramic collection is available globally starting today, $499</p><h2 id="here-comes-the-case-finally-2">Here comes the case, finally</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="7RCERCqUGdNYgDdqnFS4M6" name="Oura-Ring-4-ceramic" alt="Oura Ring 4 ceramic collection is here" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7RCERCqUGdNYgDdqnFS4M6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3240" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Oura)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you'd ask an Oura Ring 4 owner what they were missing, their answer would most likely be a wireless charging case. Finally, we have one. Oura has launched its first-ever charging case after giving us four generations of its rings. While it's only compatible with the latest gen smart ring, the case can power up to 5 full charges and complete one ring charge as well as the case charge in 90 minutes.</p><p>The case is black and looks like a clamshell with smooth, rounded edges, making the Oura Ring feel like a pearl in the center. Oura says each case is size-specific, so you can't share it unless someone has the same size. It also doubles as a secure spot to store the ring, because let's face it, sometimes I'm hunting for mine all around the house.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.64%;"><img id="HTj4ycJnhDaMsGJk6sfnRD" name="Oura-Ring-4-charging-case" alt="Oura launches it's first ever charging case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HTj4ycJnhDaMsGJk6sfnRD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1280" height="853" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Oura)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The case is made from recycled aluminum and is anodized. It has a silicone insert on the inside, which creates a sort of seal, making the case dust and splash-resistant.  Oura's spokesperson told Android Central that this case could last you an entire month-long trip to Europe, considering the Oura Ring 4 survives for up to eight days on a single charge. So, do the math!</p><p>The LED indicator on the case displays the Ring's charge level when inserted, and the case's charge level when empty. Lastly, the case weighs about 60 grams, can be charged via a USB-C cable, and costs $99. As of now, this charging case will only be available in the US starting today (Oct. 1), but Oura says they'll bring it to more markets globally later this year.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The goal is to move beyond just tracking data to enabling proactive health management.</p><p>The idea is simple: blood results show the “what,” and the Oura Ring shows the “why.” If your A1C is creeping up, you can immediately see how your eating habits, workouts, or restless nights might be contributing. The Health Panels go beyond passive tracking and tie everything together in one app, so instead of a stack of lab reports, you get a clear picture of your overall health.</p><h2 id="seamless-in-app-process-2">Seamless in-app process</h2><p>Through a partnership with Quest Diagnostics, Oura members can book tests directly inside the Oura app and choose from roughly 2,000 Quest locations across the U.S. A licensed clinician signs off on the order, the blood draw happens in person, and the results land back in the Oura app with a design that highlights the most important trends instead of burying you in spreadsheets.</p><p>Beyond just providing results, the Health Panels service makes the data actionable with the help of Oura Advisor.

There's a major difference being noted in this updated AI scanner: Google Drive essentially now runs in automatic mode the entire time, foregoing the user's manual input entirely. The test showed that users can continuously place new documents before the scanner for automatic Drive storage additions, all powered autonomously by its AI software.</p><p>However, users can "stop" or pause this automatic function from taking place, though it seems the scanner will still identify that there's a document in front of it with a colored outline.</p><p>Around the centered stop button, Google Drive displays a squiggly, fun animation that circles it, and when it completes, your scan is done. Every scanned page/document is listed under your bottom row of icons, so users can easily swipe through and make sure everything is correct.</p><p>The publication noticed a slight design change in the scanner's viewfinder. Now, instead of appearing a little boxy or rectangular in the center of your display, the viewfinder fills up the entire top portion of your screen.</p><h2 id="material-3-expressive-is-the-design-all-apps-want-to-wear-2">Material 3 Expressive is the design all apps want to wear</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:269px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:223.05%;"><img id="TCMPzsDkCbKpvvd68Tkkrb" name="google-drive-ai-scanner-labs-update" alt="A snapshot of Google Drive's new AI scanner for documents, which now displays a colored outline when it's identified pages and a new "stop" or pause button right under its viewfinder." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TCMPzsDkCbKpvvd68Tkkrb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="269" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The publication states users may find this Labs experiment for Drive's scanner slowly throughout the week, via a new card that appears when opening the feature. What's more, the publication states this new test arrived shortly after Drive's Material 3 Expressive update, which seems to have altered its AI scanner in Labs.</p><p>Material 3 Expressive, Android's new design language, has been making its way around the entire ecosystem <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/wear-os/wear-os-is-ditching-its-old-look-for-a-flashy-material-3-expressive-makeover">since earlier this year</a>, when it hit wearables.

While things become a little prettier, Google also wanted its Android software to be easier to use. Many UI elements have been altered to satisfy that "ease of use" mentality Google had for Android users.</p> ]]></dc:content>

While the company had been skimping on major changes in previous generations, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> and Galaxy Z Flip 7 bring several big overhauls. And it looks like Samsung's hard work is paying off, as the company says the new foldables are seeing strong demand in the U.S.</p><p>Samsung, in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/us/more-consumers-upgrading-switching-to-samsung-galaxy-z-series-us/?utm_source=pr_media&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=general">press release</a>, called the launch of the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Galaxy Z Flip 7 an "inflection point" for the category. The company says the smaller <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-review">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> is "garnering the most interest" and "converting" consumers into Galaxy users "at a record pace compared to previous Flip devices."</p><p>On the other hand, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 seems to be a hit among Galaxy S Ultra users. Samsung says nearly 30% of people upgrading to the Galaxy Z Fold 7 are coming from an S series Ultra model. The brand also says the new foldables set a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-z-fold-7-is-so-popular-samsung-scrambling-for-more">"record-breaking" preorder period</a> in July, which continues even two months later, with the Galaxy Z Fold 7 sales exceeding the previous generation by 50%.</p><h2 id="make-a-better-foldable-see-2">Make a better foldable, see</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="eFWyqZviHc8mLXoxuTLZw3" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on-29" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 colors hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eFWyqZviHc8mLXoxuTLZw3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>And honestly, it's not surprising to see why the new Galaxy foldables are selling well. Compared to the Z Fold 6, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is both lighter and thinner. Not only that, but the Galaxy Z Fold 7 also solved one of the major pain points with previous-generation Z Fold devices by making the cover screen much closer to a standard smartphone.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Flip 7, while not much thinner than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Z Flip 6</a>, offers a larger battery and a bigger cover display. Both foldables are also powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset, which has proven excellent for both performance and efficiency.</p><p>Samsung also says AI has played a big role in the popularity of the new foldables. The company claims around 80% of users have tried AI features on their Galaxy smartphone and "two-thirds use them regularly." Interestingly, though, the most used AI features are not by Samsung — the top two are Google Gemini and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>.</p><p>That said, it's great to see the foldable form factor gaining more attention in the U.S. Samsung is about to face its next competitor with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-fold">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a> launching soon, but it looks like the company has found a winning formula with the seventh generation of its foldables.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="943e6917-6e1e-4dfe-8851-022a2acf8c68">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:99.93%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZjEHMiG3oH3ehN7hbGK5ym.jpg' alt="Galaxy Z Fold 7 render"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 7 is the thinnest-ever book-style foldable by the brand.

Since you can't easily use an Apple Watch with an Android phone or vice versa, the decision largely rests upon which ecosystem you've already invested in.</p><p>However, if you're wondering how the Series 11 stacks up against the Pixel Watch 4, we have you covered. After all, there <em>is</em> a way to use an Apple Watch without daily driving an iPhone, so Android users can use the Series 11 as their smartwatch if they really want to. Let's break down all the differences between the latest Apple Watch Series 11 and the Google Pixel Watch 4.</p><h2 id="apple-watch-series-11-vs-google-pixel-watch-4-design-and-display-2">Apple Watch Series 11 vs. Google Pixel Watch 4: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PiFcBrBww44uiawZ7NXyri" name="Apple-Watch-Series-11-2" alt="The Apple Watch Series 11 display shown at multiple angles." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PiFcBrBww44uiawZ7NXyri.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Neither Apple nor Google deviated significantly from their typical smartwatch design language when creating the Series 11 or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/google-pixel-watch-4-hands-on">Pixel Watch 4</a>. They resemble their predecessors closely, but are distinct from one another. Apple Watches tend to sport a mostly square design with a cover glass and chassis that are slightly curved. Meanwhile, Pixel Watch models feature a "waterdrop" design with a circular shape and curved glass that seamlessly integrates into the chassis.</p><p>Overall, the Pixel Watch 4 looks more minimalist and dainty than the Series 11. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/5-things-android-should-steal-from-apple-iphone-17-event">Apple Watch Series 11</a> is available in either 42mm or 46mm case sizes, whereas the Pixel Watch 4 is offered in 41mm or 45mm case sizes.

There are also more colors and band configurations on the Apple Watch side, and the Series 11 has the advantage of being backwards-compatible with all prior bands within their size bloc (38mm, 40mm, 41mm, 42mm bands are interchangeable; 42mm, 44mm, 45mm, 46mm, 49mm bands are interchangeable).</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NkndnC6F4UVpJ8aA3gX28j" name="Apple-Watch-Series-11-3" alt="The Apple Watch Series 11 display shown at multiple angles." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NkndnC6F4UVpJ8aA3gX28j.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Pixel Watch 4's display is now domed to match the cover glass and is brighter than the Series 11 with a peak brightness rating of 3,000 nits. By comparison, the Apple Watch Series 11 has the advantage of supporting wide-angle OLED technology, which should make it easier to view off-angle than the Pixel Watch 4. The Series 11 display is also slightly higher in resolution, with a pixel density of 326ppi compared to 320ppi on the Pixel Watch 4.</p><p>In terms of durability, the titanium Series 11 uses a sapphire crystal covering, and the aluminum Series 11 uses Ion-X glass. Ion-X is more crack-resistant, while sapphire crystal is more scratch-resistant. Google has Custom Corning Gorilla Glass 5 on the Pixel Watch 4 for scratch and crack protection. Additionally, both watches are swimproof and rated for 5ATM.</p><h2 id="apple-watch-series-11-vs-google-pixel-watch-4-hardware-and-specs-2">Apple Watch Series 11 vs. Google Pixel Watch 4: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Ngu94MvMgAtT8i8i2x8R25" name="Apple-Watch-Series-11-BPM" alt="Blood pressure monitoring on the Apple Watch Series 11." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ngu94MvMgAtT8i8i2x8R25.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>From a hardware perspective, both smartwatches will be plenty fast. The Apple Watch Series 11 is powered by the S10 chip, a system-in-package processor that includes a dual-core processor and a quad-core Neural Engine. Meanwhile, the Pixel Watch 4 includes a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/snapdragon-w5-gen-2-revealed-with-satellite-sos-but-no-major-power-boost">Qualcomm Snapdragon W5 Gen 2</a> chip with a Cortex-M55 co-processor.</p><p>Google's leveraging of the co-processor for certain tasks helped it improve battery life for the Pixel Watch 4. The smaller version of the Pixel Watch 4 now lasts up to 30 hours, while the larger model can run for up to 40 hours. That's longer, at least on paper, than the Series 11, which is rated for 24 hours of battery life. It's worth noting that in the past, you could get more battery life out of Apple Watches and Pixel Watches than officially claimed.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Specs</p></th><th  ><p>Apple Watch Series 11</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel Watch 4</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>watchOS 26</p></td><td  ><p>Wear OS 6</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>CPU</p></td><td  ><p>S10 chip with 64‑bit dual-core processor; quad-core Neural Engine</p></td><td  ><p>Snapdragon W5 Gen 2, Cortex M55 co-processor</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>Wide-angle OLED, LTPO3 display, 416 by 496 pixels, 1220 sq mm display area, 326ppi, up to 2,000 nits peak brightness</p></td><td  ><p>Actua 360 AMOLED LTPO display, 320ppi</p><p>3,000 nits, 1-60Hz refresh rate</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM / Storage</p></td><td  ><p>1GB (unconfirmed) + 64GB</p></td><td  ><p>2GB + 32GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>L1 GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, QZSS, and BeiDou, RedCap for 5G and LTE, Wi-Fi 4 (802.11n), 2.4GHz and 5GHz Wi-Fi networks, Bluetooth 5.3, Second-generation Ultra Wideband chip, NFC</p></td><td  ><p>Bluetooth 6, Wi-Fi 2.4/5GHz, NFC, UWB, LTE (optional), dual-frequency GPS, Galileo, Glonass, (ROW) Beidou, QZSS, Navic, Satellite SOS, </p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Sensors</p></td><td  ><p>Electrical heart sensor, third‑generation optical heart sensor, Blood oxygen sensor, Temperature sensor, Compass, Always‑on altimeter, High‑g accelerometer, High dynamic range gyroscope, Ambient light sensor, Depth gauge to 6 meters, Water temperature sensor</p></td><td  ><p>Compass, altimeter, barometer, magnetometer, 3-axis accelerometer, gyroscope, ambient light, multi-path optical heart rate sensor, cEDA, SpO2, ECG, far field skin temperature sensor</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 24 hours, up to 38 hours in Low Power Mode</p></td><td  ><p><strong>41mm</strong>: 325mAh, 30 hours with AOD, 48 hours with Battery Saver</p><p><strong>45mm</strong>: 455mAh, 40 hours with AOD, 72 hours with Battery Saver</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 80% charge in about 30 minutes</p></td><td  ><p><strong>41mm</strong>: 15 minutes to 50%, 25 minutes to 80%, 45 minutes to 100%</p><p><strong>45mm</strong>: 15 minutes to 50%, 30 minutes to 80%, 60 minutes to 100%</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Materials</p></td><td  ><p>Aluminum or titanium</p></td><td  ><p>Recycled aluminum</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Protection</p></td><td  ><p>Ion‑X front glass with 2x scratch resistance (aluminum cases) OR sapphire front crystal (titanium cases)</p><p>5ATM, IP6X</p></td><td  ><p>Custom Corning Gorilla Glass 5, 5ATM, IP68</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Band</p></td><td  ><p>Multiple band options</p></td><td  ><p>Active (fluoroelastomer)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>42mm x 39mm x 9.7mm / 46mm x 39mm x 9.7mm </p></td><td  ><p>41 x 41 x 12.3mm / 45 x 45 x 12.3mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight (w/out band)</p></td><td  ><p><strong>42mm: </strong>30.3 grams </p><p><strong>46mm:</strong> 37.8 grams</p></td><td  ><p><strong>41mm</strong>: 31g</p><p><strong>45mm</strong>: 36.7g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p><strong>Aluminum:</strong> Rose Gold, Silver, Space Gray, Jet Black</p><p><strong>Titanium:</strong> Gold, Natural, Slate</p></td><td  ><p>Matte Black, Polished Silver, Champagne Gold (41mm), Satin Moonstone (45mm)</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Apple hasn't confirmed the amount of memory onboard the Apple Watch Series 11, but it does provide 64GB of storage.

Lighter and darker tones should appear more vibrant and bold when watching your favorite shows and movies. Dolby Vision and HDR10 Plus Adaptive Technology are included in these two QLED series TV sizes, alongside a processor that's 40% faster.</p><p>There are some smarts with this Omni QLED series, as Amazon states the TV can "adjust its colors" based on your lighting situation.

While most competitors like Apple’s AirTag or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-plus-review">Samsung’s SmartTag</a> rotate identifiers and use stronger privacy protections, Tile relies on partial rotation that only happens under specific conditions — every 15 minutes when near the owner’s phone or once a day if separated.</p><p>Meanwhile, the static MAC address never changes, effectively acting as a beacon anyone can lock onto with basic scanning tools.</p><p>This lack of encryption means stalkers with even modest technical know-how could use off-the-shelf antennas or Bluetooth sniffers to trace someone’s movements in real time. Beyond that, researchers warn that Tile’s own infrastructure could theoretically be used to build long-term maps of user behavior, raising deeper questions about how much control the company has over people’s location data.</p><p>The vulnerabilities were first disclosed to Tile’s parent company, Life360, in late 2024, but while the company claims improvements have been made, details on exactly what was fixed remain vague.</p><h2 id="anti-theft-mode-backfires-2">Anti-Theft Mode backfires</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="A9WeWxWbkiwaWv3ZWzUE6H" name="Tile Mate (Pink Punch)_ Backpack.jpg" alt="The new Tile Mate (2024)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/A9WeWxWbkiwaWv3ZWzUE6H.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Life360)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One complicating factor is Tile’s “Anti-Theft Mode.” Rolled out as a way to make trackers invisible to scans, the feature requires users to upload government ID and selfies, while also agreeing to a clause that lets Tile share their information with law enforcement — even without a subpoena — if misuse is suspected.</p><p>The company has even tied a $1 million fine to confirmed cases of abuse. While this might sound like a deterrent, critics say the feature strips away key safeguards. When Anti-Theft Mode is enabled, Tile tags no longer show up in the Scan & Secure feature, making it easier for malicious actors to plant trackers on unsuspecting people without detection.</p><p>Researchers also demonstrated that attackers could record a Tile signal and replay it elsewhere, effectively spoofing a person’s location and potentially framing them.</p><p>In a statement to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/787836/tile-trackers-stalking-research-unencrypted" target="_blank">The Verge</a>, Tile insists it takes security seriously, pointing to ongoing bug bounty programs and ethical hacker collaborations through HackerOne. But until the company demonstrates meaningful fixes, the burden falls on users.</p><p>Experts recommend keeping firmware and app versions up to date, avoiding Anti-Theft Mode unless absolutely necessary, and considering alternatives like Apple or Google’s trackers, which employ stronger privacy protections.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Then, at Meta Connect 2025, we got Oakley Meta Vanguard, which added Meta tech to Oakley's athletic Sphaera sunglasses.</p><p>The question is, if you're an athlete or an Oakley fan, should you go with Vanguard or HSTN? Believe it or not, the choice is pretty easy. If you need a pair of glasses or sunglasses for all-day wear, Oakley Meta HSTN are the way to go. Those who need something exclusive to workouts and fitness, with top-tier Garmin and Strava integration to match, should pick the Oakley Meta Vanguard.</p><p>There is a bit more to it than that, so let's break down all the differences between these two styles of Oakley Meta smart glasses.</p><h2 id="oakley-meta-vanguard-vs-oakley-meta-hstn-pricing-and-availability-2">Oakley Meta Vanguard vs Oakley Meta HSTN: Pricing and availability</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2223px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="VA476hFjCwHij8qkptswae" name="Meta-2025-new-glasses-2" alt="Three Oakley Meta HSTN, three Oakley Meta Vanguard, and three Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2), along with cases, sitting atop a table in various styles, along with the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses in front of them all." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VA476hFjCwHij8qkptswae.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2223" height="1250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oakley-meta-vanguard-smart-glasses-hands-on">Oakley Meta Vanguard</a> was announced at Meta Connect and are set for release on Oct. 21, 2025.

They're also based upon popular and longtime Oakley styles — Sphaera and HSTN. So, while tech enthusiasts might not appreciate the Oakley Meta frames, the broader group of mainstream Oakley fans might love them.</p><p>Vanguard is designed to only be worn in certain situations, like while outdoors or working out. There are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-glasses-prescription-limitations-and-workaround">no clear, prescription, or Transition lenses available for Vanguard</a>, which further cements the positioning of the smart glasses as outdoor-focused. They are large, with a hinge-to-hinge length of 136mm and a lens height of 59mm.</p><p>Oakley Meta Vanguard are heavier than the HSTN style, weighing 66 grams. However, they'll likely be more comfortable and secure than the HSTNs. This is because the Vanguard style includes a silicone nose pad for grip and tight arms that'll rest securely against your head.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QnmfTTrc76kMufv7v5DjY" name="oakley-meta-hstn-smart-glasses-01" alt="A pair of warm white Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses with gold PRIZM lenses in a peach tree" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QnmfTTrc76kMufv7v5DjY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Oakley Meta HSTN are more versatile, with a subdued design language compared to Vanguard.

At 53 grams, the Meta HSTN smart glasses should be more comfortable for all-day wear than the activity-focused Vanguard version.</p><p>Both pairs of smart glasses have the same camera, but Vanguard positions it between the two lenses. This might create a better POV experience for videos. Meanwhile, the HSTN model has the camera positioned beside the right lens. On the left side, there's an LED status indicator that lets others know when you're recording or snapping photos.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="P5jsrQT8PkTvEic94joEEE" name="Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-back-view" alt="Photo of the Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses from the back, showing the displays, nose guards, and Oakley Meta logo." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P5jsrQT8PkTvEic94joEEE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Notably, the Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses are rated for IP67 certification against dust and water ingress.

They both sport the same 12MP ultrawide with a photo resolution of 3024 x 4032 pixels. Both pairs of smart glasses can also record 3K video at 30 FPS, and presumably, Vanguard will have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oakley-meta-hstn-camera-review">the same or better video stabilization as HSTN</a>. They have 32GB of onboard storage, which translates to over 1,000 photos or over 100 30-second video recordings.</p><p>Additionally, Oakley Meta Vanguard and HSTN have two open-air speakers, but they're not identical. Vanguard's speakers are six decibels louder than the ones inside HSTN, and Meta claims you can hear them in up to 30 MPH winds.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Oakley Meta Vanguard</p></th><th  ><p>Oakley Meta HSTN</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Camera</p></td><td  ><p>12MP Ultrawide</p></td><td  ><p>12MP Ultrawide</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Photo resolution</p></td><td  ><p>3024 X 4032 pixels (Portrait only)</p></td><td  ><p>3024 X 4032 pixels (Portrait only)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Video resolution</p></td><td  ><p>3K (~2300 x 3100) at 30 fps (Portrait only)</p></td><td  ><p>3K (~2300 x 3100) at 30 fps (Portrait only)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Water resistance</p></td><td  ><p>IP67</p></td><td  ><p>IPX4</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Speakers</p></td><td  ><p>Open ear</p></td><td  ><p>Open ear</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Interface</p></td><td  ><p>Touchpad on side, Meta AI for voice and camera</p></td><td  ><p>Touchpad on side, Meta AI for voice and camera</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Microphones</p></td><td  ><p>5-mic Array</p></td><td  ><p>5-mic Array</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>32GB; about 100+ videos (30 sec) and 1000+ photos</p></td><td  ><p>32GB; about 100+ videos (30 sec) and 1000+ photos</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 6; Bluetooth 5.3</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 6; Bluetooth 5.3</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Compatibility</p></td><td  ><p>iOS; Android</p></td><td  ><p>iOS; Android</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 9 hours per charge</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 8 hours per charge. 50 minutes of record time at 1080p.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging (glasses) case</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 36 hours</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 48 hours</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Prescription lens support</p></td><td  ><p>None</p></td><td  ><p>-6.00 to +4.00</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>66g</p></td><td  ><p>53g</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Both glasses are compatible with iOS and Android via the Meta AI companion app. They use Bluetooth 5.3 for pairing and Wi-Fi 6 for updates and media transfer.

Oakley Meta Vanguard are the pinnacle of specialization — they're set to be absolutely excellent for workouts, training, and fitness, but probably not much else. Like the non-smart Oakley Sphaera sunglasses they're based on, Vanguard is intended to be used outdoors during physical activity, not all-day wear.</p><p>That said, if you're a runner, hiker, or biker who wants smart capabilities on your face, Oakley Meta Vanguard could be your best option. With Meta AI, Garmin Connect, and Strava integration, you can chat with your smart glasses about your pace or progress during your run hands-free. The open-air speakers for music listening and a camera for recording are added bonuses.</p><p>For people who want something sportier than Ray-Ban but more versatile than Vanguard, there's Oakley Meta HSTN.

The new version replaces the rigid, blocky color divisions with a smooth gradient blend, resulting in a more modern and fluid look.</p><p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/gradient-g-logo-design/" target="_blank">says</a> this update shows its growing focus on AI. The new gradient, which blends red, yellow, green, and blue, matches the look now seen in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/gemini">Gemini</a> and other AI-related branding.</p><p>Although subtle, the new design also aims to enhance the logo's appearance at smaller sizes (such as favicons and app icons). The smoother transitions reduce visual hard edges and help the logo sit more harmoniously next to other app icons.</p><p>The change first appeared in the Google app’s iOS version and on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/best-google-pixel-phones">Pixel phones</a>. Soon after, the Android version (via Google app version 16.18) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/05/12/google-icon-update/" target="_blank">adopted it too</a>. On the web and within some Android environments, the old version still lingers, though that’s expected to change.</p><p>Meanwhile, Google Home’s logo was quietly updated to match the new gradient aesthetic, at least in the iOS version of the app.</p><h2 id="wordmark-stays-put-2">Wordmark stays put</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:677px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:53.32%;"><img id="mKg5C37nsDWJQTWzbNpZRU" name="Google-logo-gradient" alt="Google's new gradient G logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mKg5C37nsDWJQTWzbNpZRU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="677" height="361" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Nevertheless, Google left its wordmark alone, so the familiar “Google” lettering stays the same for now. The update focuses on the “G” icon, which serves as a key visual for the brand.</p><p>Also consistent is the brand’s commitment to its four signature colors. The difference: instead of hard boundaries, those hues now flow into each other.</p><p>This redesign may be seen as a smart play: the tweak feels evolutionary rather than disruptive.</p><p>Going forward, we’ll have to wait and see whether logos for Gmail, Maps, Chrome, and others will also go the gradient route. But given how the new “G” is being positioned, it’s hard to imagine those staying rigidly block-colored forever.</p> ]]></dc:content>

So if you're looking to switch to Garmin or upgrade your current watch, we'd say you should either start here or accept that you'll have to spend more for a more premium Venu or Forerunner model.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This program is designed to gather sensor data from the Pixel Watch and pair it with user-submitted information to test how well the wearable can flag elevated blood pressure levels.</p><p>Participants who enroll in the study will be asked to answer a short questionnaire and allow the watch to passively collect health data. For a smaller group, Google may take the experiment further by providing a 24-hour blood pressure monitor for direct comparison.

This marked the first time that we had seen a modern mobile gaming device with a sliding mechanism since the Sony Xperia Play. Such a device comes with a steep asking price, but you can currently save $100 on the RG Slide from Amazon, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Handheld-4-7-inch-Capacitive-Assistant-Bluetooth/dp/B0FD9CPVSQ/?th=1"><strong>it's down to $199 for a limited time</strong></a>.</p><p>With that, you're not only getting a dedicated gaming device with a nostalgic design, but it's also equipped with a 4.7-inch LTPS display, complete with a 120Hz refresh rate. Not only that, but Anbernic managed to squeeze in a 5,000mAh battery that will last for up to six hours on a single charge.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="d2742f31-01eb-4e7a-b14a-f567b47ebc44" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Anbernic RG Slide: $299" data-dimension48="Anbernic RG Slide: $299" href="https://www.amazon.com/Handheld-4-7-inch-Capacitive-Assistant-Bluetooth/dp/B0FD9CPVSQ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="cuGm2tyLZbTqg5RUHgMjnm" name="anbernic-rg-slide-square-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cuGm2tyLZbTqg5RUHgMjnm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="800" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Anbernic RG Slide: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Handheld-4-7-inch-Capacitive-Assistant-Bluetooth/dp/B0FD9CPVSQ/?th=1" data-dimension112="d2742f31-01eb-4e7a-b14a-f567b47ebc44" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Anbernic RG Slide: $299" data-dimension48="Anbernic RG Slide: $299" data-dimension25=""><del>$299</del> <strong>$199.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>Have you been longing for a modern take on the PSP Go? Anbernic delivered just that with the RG Slide, an Android gaming handheld that features a sturdy sliding mechanism and impressive performance.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Handheld-4-7-inch-Capacitive-Assistant-Bluetooth/dp/B0FD9CPVSQ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="d2742f31-01eb-4e7a-b14a-f567b47ebc44" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Anbernic RG Slide: $299" data-dimension48="Anbernic RG Slide: $299" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You're a sucker for nostalgia and want a gaming handheld that looks like the PSP Go but plays many of your favorite retro and Android games.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You want a gaming handheld that offers a bit more power than what the Unisoc T820 in the RG Slide can provide, or you need something a bit more lightweight and pocketable.</p><p>As you'd expect, there's more than one way for you to play some games on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ayaneo-might-bring-back-one-of-the-most-unique-phone-designs-and-im-here-for-it">RG Slide</a>, as you can just stick to the touchscreen if you really wanted to. But after you push the screen upwards, you're immediately greeted with a full set of controls, including dual low-profile joysticks.</p><p>Beneath the intricate sliding mechanism and controls, we have a rather familiar set of specs, starting with the Unisoc T820. This chip was featured in last year's RG406H and RG406V, but has actually been bouncing around since 2022.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5472px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fBKxeKNViqzivtUMQiueZn" name="anbernic-rg-slide-ayaneo-pocket-dmg-psp-go" alt="Anbernic RG Slide next to AYANEO Pocket DMG and PSP Go" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fBKxeKNViqzivtUMQiueZn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5472" height="3078" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The T820 is joined by 8GB of RAM and 128GB of expandable storage, giving you plenty of wiggle room to enjoy a lot of the best Android games. And as for emulation, the T820 is capable of playing up to GameCube, Wii, and PS2, along with a tiny bit of Switch emulation if you're playing lighter titles.</p><p>The most enticing reason to pick up the RG Slide is also the biggest reason why you might want to avoid this handheld. In order to provide a gaming handheld with a sliding mechanism that won't falter, it has to be made of metal, which is exactly what Anbernic has done. On one hand, it's great knowing that you can slide the screen up and down without worrying about it breaking. On the other, this results in a device that is almost twice as heavy as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-review">Pixel 10</a>.</p><p>Even still, the RG Slide, especially for $100 off, is worth checking out if you have any interest in a modern PSP Go that runs Android and even has a 120Hz display. Plus, we expected other companies to follow Anbernic's suit after the Sony patent expired, but at the time of this writing, the RG Slide remains the only option.</p> ]]></dc:content>
