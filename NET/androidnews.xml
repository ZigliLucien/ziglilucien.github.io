Marvel's Deadpool VR was announced at Summer Games Fest today, but I got to try an early demo in late May at Meta's offices in California.</p><p>Marvel's Deadpool VR stars Emmy-winning Neil Patrick Harris as the titular antihero and was developed by Twisted Pixel. Acquired by Meta in 2021, Twisted Pixel last made beat-em-up VR game <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/path-of-the-warrior/2032870023439846">Path of the Warrior</a> in 2019. Deadpool has evidently been years in the making.</p><p>The game felt like an immediate and obvious foil to 2024's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/batman-arkham-shadow-review">Batman: Arkham Shadow VR</a>, made by another Meta-acquired developer, Camouflaj. Both have professional voice actors, long story-driven campaigns, and demanding next-gen graphics. And yet they couldn't be more different in combat, movement, and tone.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="hjHzpAoQXNBfcakQUMcgHH" name="Marvels-Deadpool-VR-screenshot-slash-effect" alt="A Deadpool VR screenshot showing a bloody sword attack and comic-book script "SLASHIMI!" above a dying bad guy." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hjHzpAoQXNBfcakQUMcgHH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Twisted Pixel / Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Deadpool snarks his way around a SHIELD helicarrier, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mojoworld">Mojoworld</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Spirit_of_Xandar">Spirit of Xandar</a>, and other Marvel Comics multiverse locales that feel like polar opposites to the dark, grounded Gotham. And the violent gun and sword battles felt more chaotic and less structured than Batman's mix of timed punches and gadget combos.</p><p>It also sounds <em>very</em> different from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_(video_game)">Activision's Deadpool</a> from 2013, which heavily focused on the X-Men comics and characters like Wolverine and Rogue. Deadpool VR's cast stars more niche characters like Mojo, Lady Deathstrike, and Flag-Smasher, and the narrative doesn't seem quite as dependent on 4th-wall breaks as the old game.</p><p>Having spent nearly an hour bumbling through one of the early levels, I can share my thoughts on the best and worst parts of Marvel's Deadpool VR during my hands-on, as well as all the game info that Twisted Pixel shared with us during the Q&A afterwards.</p><h2 id="gory-creative-combat-and-silly-one-liners-2">Gory, creative combat and silly one-liners</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4Jof1MtYccs" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>My demo started fairly early on in Marvel's Deadpool VR storyline, with Deadpool's head being studied by an evil scientist on a stolen helicarrier before you control his headless body to kill the scientist and free yourself.</p><p>Then you run through the ship, guided by a hapless SHIELD rookie by comms as you learn the controls and combat. By default, you can grab a sword over your shoulder, gun from your hip, or grenade from your wrist, and more weapons will be introduced as the game continues like a bow and arrow.</p><p>When you take damage, parts of Deadpool will fall off, and you'll have to adjust your gameplay strategy accordingly (until they grow back).</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="AAM7zMAMQcvn2bZatsTG6H" name="Marvels-Deadpool-VR-screenshot-cutscene" alt="A screenshot of Deadpool's headless body about to slam a bloodied scientist's head against a desk, with cartoonish text "Was that a tooth?!" next to him." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AAM7zMAMQcvn2bZatsTG6H.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Twisted Pixel / Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I had the least trouble mastering gunplay, aiming your default pistol or picking up weapons along the way and blasting waves of foes. You can aim at specific body parts to blast them off or use a grapple weapon to fling or disarm foes.</p><p>But gun combat is fairly common in a lot of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">Meta Quest games</a>, and the developers want you to get more creative. For that, the focal point is the close-quarters combat. With the sword, you can dismember body parts, then pick them up and throw them at other enemies. You can counter attacks from shielded foes, or fling your sword at a far-away enemy before grabbing a new one.</p><p>The goal, Twisted Pixel said, is to "Say yes to the player" and "reward creativity," and that there was a "bunch of stuff that you guys didn't try" that we'd discover naturally across the campaign, but is available from the start.</p><p>The devs also promised things like a "boomerang sword" and "exploding bullets," and there will be custom moves you can use against specific enemies or with certain weapons.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="24v6m78PT2Yw9gRYmkGKyG" name="Marvels-Deadpool-VR-screenshot-violent-sword-combat" alt="A Deadpool VR screenshot showing an impaled head on a held sword with the headless soldier in the near distance." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/24v6m78PT2Yw9gRYmkGKyG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Twisted Pixel / Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, sword combat is also where I had the most trouble. I would swipe my sword at a foe and, for whatever reason, it would simply dance around their body with no effect while they hit or shot me. I especially struggled with shielded foes meant for close-quarters combat, who would wail on me while I swiped helplessly back.</p><p>I assumed it was a skill issue on my end, and I needed to master the timing of sword strikes better. But other journalists I spoke to after the demo agreed that sword attacks felt somewhat weightless.</p><p>The Twisted Pixel devs responded by saying they didn't want the reverse side of VR melee combat, where you simply hold your sword toward an enemy, "waggle it," and have it "chop people up instantly." They say they're "still working on" a "combination of animation, haptic feedback, and sound" to make sword impacts feel satisfying.</p><p>So I'm curious how it'll feel in the final version, with more practice. I'd say swordplay is the most important part of a Deadpool VR game, so I'm hoping they get it right.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="mAKH2oeLeJ6drmf5mRaPWH" name="Marvels-Deadpool-VR-screenshot-sword-combat" alt="A Deadpool VR screenshot showing Deadpool holding a sword and throwing knife as two ninja-like foes charge towards the player." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mAKH2oeLeJ6drmf5mRaPWH.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Twisted Pixel / Meta)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="yaZqsMWvJDow3EtTVRrtRH" name="Marvels-Deadpool-VR-screenshot-bow-and-arrow-combat" alt="A Deadpool VR screenshot showing the player holding a bow and arrow, pointing at a charging ninja enemy." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yaZqsMWvJDow3EtTVRrtRH.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Twisted Pixel / Meta)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="PN63uPW5fkRMo5rohWpCNH" name="Marvels-Deadpool-VR-screenshot-gun-combat" alt="A Deadpool VR screenshot showing Deadpool dual-wielding pistols pointed at a cyborg enemy leaping down towards the player." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PN63uPW5fkRMo5rohWpCNH.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Twisted Pixel / Meta)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="2Ai9zRfMFdprhZd7mii6GH" name="Marvels-Deadpool-VR-screenshot-sniper-combat" alt="A Deadpool VR screenshot showing the player pointing a laser-pointed sniper rifle at a foe across the room." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2Ai9zRfMFdprhZd7mii6GH.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Twisted Pixel / Meta)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Outside of combat, Deadpool runs and parkours around the stage, with double-jumping available for more flexible movement. Just in the early level, I spotted comic book collectables and mysterious doors I couldn't open labeled "Lady Deadpool" and other Deadpool-adjacent names.</p><p>Twisted Pixel promised replayability features and secret levels, so I wonder if you'll be able to go back through levels as other multiverse versions of Deadpool, similar to what we saw in the movie Deadpool & Wolverine.</p><p>But the <em>main</em> version of Deadpool, voiced by Neil Patrick Harris, was a lot of fun in my brief hands-on. They said their version of Deadpool "pulls more strongly from the comics" than from the movie Deadpool. They also mentioned how great it was to collaborate with Harris, who would riff off their script with his own comedy and one-liners.</p><h2 id="diving-into-the-marvel-mojoverse-2">Diving into the Marvel Mojoverse</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ZQbjLTNUaUE44Bumq4kdTH" name="Marvels-Deadpool-VR-screenshot-mojoworld" alt="A Deadpool VR screenshot showing the character Mojo and two bodyguards standing in a casino-like room, with Mojo flipping an M-labeled gold coin to Deadpool." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZQbjLTNUaUE44Bumq4kdTH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Twisted Pixel / Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The main premise of Deadpool VR seems to be that Deadpool makes some kind of "shitty deal" with the sorcerer Mojo, aka "hip-hop Satan," without reading the "fine print."</p><p>He then gets flung into different Marvel Comics locations in the Mojoverse, an extradimensional and extratemporal realm, facing off against foes like Flag-Smasher, Lady Deathstrike, and Omega Red.</p><p>Twisted Pixel promised "iconic (and not-so-iconic) villains," so I'm curious if we'll get more household names or stick to smaller foes to make Deadpool VR more distinct.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Vk6irNUjymbKrVB4aTBWFH" name="Marvels-Deadpool-VR-screenshot-combat-holding-arm" alt="A Deadpool VR screenshot showing Deadpool holding his severed left hand in his right arm, with foes shooting the player and red damage indicators along the screen edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Vk6irNUjymbKrVB4aTBWFH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Twisted Pixel / Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>"We're not pulling from a particular story arc that exists already," the devs explained. "This is definitely our own thing. We wanted to come to this and make sure that it's our own story, it's our own Deadpool."</p><p>And by doing it this way, they want it to be <em>your</em> Deadpool that you can play in unique ways. "If people can get Deadpool in their head, they'll try stuff that Deadpool would, and it's super fun because it rewards you for doing it." So any time a playtester tries something that doesn't work, they add it in the next build.</p><p>Marvel's Deadpool VR comes out in "late 2025." My guess is that we'll see a proper release date around Meta Connect 2025 this fall, with more details on things like pricing and campaign length.</p><p>You'll need a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Quest 3</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-review">Quest 3S</a> to play this exclusive, which may disappoint Deadpool-loving gamers without a VR headset. But based on my hands-on, Quest owners are in for a treat!</p> ]]></dc:content>

If you know what specs you're looking for and in what sort of price range, one look at this chart will tell you which cable is right for you.</p><p>If you're still clueless, don't worry my friend. I've got you! Ask yourself a few questions and the answer will become clear.</p><p>First off, what phone do you use? If you're an Apple user with an iPhone older than the 15 series, obviously you'll need a lightning connector. Anker and Raycon are both great options. The Raycon cable is superior from every perspective, except for the cost. It's got swappable connectors so you can use it with all your other gadgets too. If you don't want to spend $35 on a cable, Anker will do just fine.</p><p>For my Android users, pick the Baseus 100W cable and don't look back. The 6ft variant is long enough for most use cases and the nylon-braided structure makes it highly durable. And get this, the 6ft version is only $10! That's the best deal you'll ever find on such a speedy USB-C cable.</p><p>Now, if you've got a wired pair of headphones, earphones, or in-ear monitors, you'll probably want to check out the budget-friendly JSAUX USB-C Headphone Charger too. This DAC adds a handy 3.5mm headphone jack to your smartphone, something all the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> lack these days. Since there's USB-C passthrough charging, you don't even have to worry about blocking off your Type-C port when using the adapter. For $13, that's as good as it gets.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Will it get cheaper, and is it worth it to buy the 2024 device when the next-gen flip phone drops? </p><p>After all, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 debuted last summer with a steep $1,099.99 price tag, so it&apos;s no wonder people have been looking for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/deals">deals</a>. At this point we can only speculate, but I&apos;ve been working launches like this long enough that I have a pretty good idea of what you can expect. Let&apos;s dive in. </p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-we-know"><span>What we know</span></h3><p>If the latest leaks and rumors are correct, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> will be revealed during a live Samsung Unpacked event in early July. The new clamshell foldable will likely be announced alongside the premium Galaxy Z Fold 7 and two Samsung smartwatches, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8 and Watch 8 Classic</a>. </p><p>The Z Flip 7 is expected to come loaded with a powerful Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, an updated design, and a larger cover display than ever before (think more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025">Motorola Razr</a>-esque). The flip phone is also certain to feature all of the latest Galaxy AI software features and seven years of guaranteed OS and security upgrades. As for the cameras, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/early-alleged-galaxy-z-flip-7-camera-specs-detailed">one rumor</a> has suggested that the Z Flip 7 will retain its predecessor&apos;s camera tech, which would be quite controversial among Samsung users if the leak proves accurate. </p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="muLAZxgnWdWVKXRtcCm2bH" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-Flex-Mode-Panel.jpg" alt="Galaxy Z Flip 6 Flex Mode Panel with Instagram running" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/muLAZxgnWdWVKXRtcCm2bH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Still, the biggest question mark comes down to the phone&apos;s price.

It&apos;s hard to say, but considering that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Motorola Razr Ultra (2025)</a> — the Flip&apos;s biggest competitor — was recently unveiled with a $1,300 price tag, I wouldn&apos;t put it past them. There&apos;s also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-might-hold-back-the-budget-galaxy-z-flip-7-model-until-late-2025">some speculation</a> that the Z Flip 7 will be announced alongside a more-affordable "Fan Edition" version of the phone, but details on that rumor are scarce.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-will-the-z-flip-6-get-cheaper"><span>Will the Z Flip 6 get cheaper?</span></h3><p>So now for the big question: will last year&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> finally get cheaper now that the Z Flip 7 is on the way? The answer may not be as simple as you&apos;d like. </p><p>The good news is that the top-rated flip phone is already being discounted fairly often by retailers and wireless carriers alike. As of writing, for example, the unlocked Z Flip 6 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D195JKYD"><strong>over $200 off at Amazon,</strong></a> while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.att.com/buy/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip6.html"><strong>AT&T is dropping up to $1,000 off</strong></a> the phone when you trade in and add a line. </p><p>Now, you might see those deals and be tempted to wait until the Z Flip 7 arrives to see if the price drops even further, but I&apos;d be careful. Retailers will often discount a phone <em>before</em> its next generation arrives to make room for new stock. This means that the Galaxy Z Flip 6 might be sold out on most sites by the time you&apos;re ready to buy, which gives you less leverage as a consumer.</p><p>But there&apos;s a bright side. Amazon&apos;s Prime Day sale is likely to be announced in the coming weeks, and if past year&apos;s are any indication, the event will fall right around the same time as the Galaxy Z Flip 7 announcement. <strong>This upcoming sale might be the best opportunity to get the Galaxy Z Flip 6 at a serious discount</strong>, as retailers all across the web will be taking on Amazon with competitive offers of their own. This puts you in the driver&apos;s seat, and it will likely result in some of the best Galaxy Z Flip 6 deals we&apos;ve ever seen. </p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="8a540a43-dcb6-468b-b250-8c0176ee90d9">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JrEgbbZSCjj6z4VY5Zx5XP.jpg' alt="Render of the blue Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Still a great flip phone</strong></em></p><p>Although it's about to hit last-gen status, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 remains a great <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phone</a> with a sleek, super-pocketable design, loads of AI features, and years of guaranteed software support.

This year, Spotify said it paid out over $10 billion to the music industry globally in 2024, marking the largest single-year payout by any retailer in music history.</p><p>The report also adds that nearly 1,500 artists generated over $1 million in royalties from Spotify alone in 2024. And 80% of these artists didn't have their song reach the Spotify Global Daily Top 50 chart. Meaning, without having a mainstream hit, they were still able to generate revenue.</p><p>The surprising part, however, is that Canadian artists seem to be thriving globally, and in 2024, Canadian music artists earned CAD<strong> </strong>$460 million in royalties on Spotify, which is almost double the earnings they made since 2019. Spotify says this was possible because Canadian-grown global stars like The Weeknd, Justin Bieber, Céline Dion, and more have built a strong foundation for budding artists.</p><p>"That’s not just streams; that’s sustainable careers being built in studios, basements, and tour vans from Vancouver to Halifax," the streaming giant added.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3imaMspAbZLSG2pt5DtEZT" name="The-Weeknd-on-Spotify" alt="The Weeknd on Spotify" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3imaMspAbZLSG2pt5DtEZT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Spotify)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Speaking of where these royalties were earned, Spotify says that 94% of the money earned by Canadian artists through Spotify came from outside Canada.</p><p>This means Canada has become one of the world's top music exporters, and that Canadian music is not only being streamed locally but also in "cities like Jakarta, Osaka, Melbourne, London, São Paulo, Berlin, Mexico City, and Seoul."</p><p>Since Canada is a bilingual country, its French music also saw a 15% growth in global Spotify royalties just in the past year.</p><p>For instance, "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://open.spotify.com/track/44A0o4jA8F2ZF03Zacwlwx">Québécois artist Patrick Watson’s 'Je te laisserai des mots'</a> was the most popular francophone track on Spotify globally in 2024, and the first French-language track to pass 1 billion streams," the report stated.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4083px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="xiSaKKC5vQVxF8rM7NZufU" name="Spotify-Jam" alt="Spotify Jam" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xiSaKKC5vQVxF8rM7NZufU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4083" height="2297" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Furthermore, Spotify says that Canadian women have also been at the front and center of music creation, and since 2020, their global streams on Spotify have also doubled. And as of 2024, "40% of Canadian artists earning over CAD $1 million on Spotify were women or in groups with both male and female members."</p><p>“This is what Canada sounds like—diverse, digital, and not just thriving domestically, but leading on the world stage. The data is clear in underscoring the vital role that export plays in sustaining the overall health of Canada’s music industry,” said Xenia Manning, director of Global Music Policy, Spotify.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The tipster alleges that Huawei is working on a sequel to its Mate XT tri-fold, which could be called the "Mate XT 2," if we're being incremental. There's supposedly more going on with this next phone by way of hardware upgrades.</p><p>DCS claims the tri-fold could sport a brand new, upgraded SoC (processor), possibly built off an "N-1" generation chip. In response to a comment, DCS said the chip could be Huawei's Kirin 9020. Additionally, the phone's imaging power could go up a level, though it's unclear just how far Huawei is willing to push its cameras.</p><p>Considering how early these rumors are, there's nothing concrete to go on (aside from the chip's apparent name drop).

The publication reiterates the device's use of the Kirin 9010 processor, so it would make sense that Huawei might upgrade that key specification.</p><p>Additionally, the Mate XT debuted with a triple camera array, consisting of a 50MP lens with f/1.4 aperture, a 12MP ultrawide-angle lens, and a 12MP periscope lens.</p><p>With rumors suggesting we could see an imaging upgrade, maybe Huawei's looking at the ultrawide and periscope lenses. Of course, it would be nice if that primary lens jumped to 100MP or more, but we'll just have to wait and see.</p><p>Aside from Huawei, we're also expecting Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-teases-a-wild-new-foldable-phone-dropping-in-late-2025">to step into the tri-fold world</a> for the first time.

This theory is also consistent with past years of the event, as the Galaxy Z Fold 6 was initially announced on July 10th, 2024 with a July 24th release date. </p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 is expected to be announced alongside the clamshell-style <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a>, plus we should be getting a release date for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8</a> and Watch 8 Classic. There's also a chance that Samsung will surprise-drop a first look at its triple-folding <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-tri-fold-name-change-hardware-specs-rumored">Galaxy G Fold</a>, but info on that phone is relatively scarce at this time. </p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="f7mGPGbcitjef6WE8oaYJj" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-12.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 review cover screen in-hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f7mGPGbcitjef6WE8oaYJj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For specs, the premium foldable is likely to feature the same Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset that powers the Galaxy S25 series, plus a new-and-improved "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-may-finally-bring-this-much-needed-upgrade-to-the-galaxy-z-fold-7">creaseless foldable panel</a>", two vibrant AMOLED displays, and the thinnest design of any Z Fold phone to date.</p><p>It's also quite possible that the Z Fold 7 will be more expensive than its predecessor, and considering that the 2024 model already started at a steep $1,799.99, we better hope that the preorder deals are especially good this year.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-will-the-z-fold-6-get-cheaper"><span>Will the Z Fold 6 get cheaper?</span></h3><p>So given the information detailed above, should you expect the Galaxy Z Fold 6 to get cheaper when the Z Fold 7 arrives? Well, it's complicated. </p><p>For starters, it's worth mentioning that the Galaxy Z Fold 6 is already being discounted quite heavily across most retailers. At the time of writing, for instance, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Handsfree-Interpreter-Manufacturer/dp/B0D18QJCPR"><strong>Amazon is slashing over 20% off</strong></a> the unlocked foldable, bringing the price down to $1,499.99. These deals are presumably meant to clear stock ahead of the Z Fold 7's release, and with the swift arrival of Amazon Prime Day (also slated for early July), it's unlikely that there will be many Z Fold 6 units <em>left</em> when the new foldable phone finally arrives. </p><p>In other words, I'd suggest that the best time to buy a phone is <em>right before</em> its next generation arrives, rather than right after. Sure, the Z Fold 6 might get a permanent price drop when its successor hits store shelves, but it's just as likely to be largely out of stock by that time (unless you're cool with a refurbished version). <strong>In conclusion, if you prefer unlocked </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/deals"><strong>phone deals</strong></a><strong>, Amazon Prime Day 2025 is going to be the best time to buy the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6. </strong></p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="cf31ab8c-d35f-433a-931f-77066ba9372b">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:98.61%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Qk9BrbQMCLYk6ofsRaMfP.jpg' alt="Galaxy Z Fold 6 render in white"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Premium foldable, premium price</strong></em></p><p>Although it's soon to be supplanted by the Z Fold 7, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 remains one of the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">best foldable phones</a> around, boasting a powerful Snapdragon chipset, two glorious 120Hz AMOLED displays, and excellent battery life.

According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/06/05/google-search-live-testing/">9to5Google</a>, which spotted the test, this experiment places AI Mode in the center with a familiar Gemini Live vibe. When activated in the main Google app, via a wavelength icon under the search bar, Search Live will welcome users with a descriptive splash page. The company states, "With Live, you can have a real-time voice conversation with AI Mode to find exactly what you're looking for."</p><p>After unmuting, users will be free to voice whatever their query is, similar to speaking in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/gemini-live-pixel-9-pro-grocery-list">Gemini Live</a> (even the UI is kind of the same).</p><p>Search Live will process your query and is said to deliver a "scrollable carousel" of results. This is likely similar to every other Google Search experience where, when receiving your answers, the most prominent (or best) result is first, with varying degrees of relevance beneath that. Users can, of course, interact with these results, tapping them for more information.</p><p>The publication states users can ask follow-up questions if they're still unsure; however, there's a chance <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-tests-experimental-ai-mode">AI Mode</a> will ask you to "clarify."</p><h2 id="google-s-highlight-ai-mode-2">Google's Highlight: AI Mode</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:267px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.72%;"><img id="B5tjnLpQPBAH93yu9HGWmQ" name="google-ai-mode-search-live-splash-page" alt="AI Mode's "Search Live" test displays a splash page explaining users can have a conversation with the feature for real-time results." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B5tjnLpQPBAH93yu9HGWmQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="267" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:276px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:217.39%;"><img id="NVogVeKWQfCuyUKExMv3mQ" name="google-ai-mode-search-live-results-example" alt="AI Mode's "Search Live" test will display a "scrollable carousel" of results for users to look through." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NVogVeKWQfCuyUKExMv3mQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="276" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>There are some little details, such as the "Transcript" button's existence isn't what it seems. The post states tapping this just lets you text chat with AI Mode, not receive written notes for reflection later. Moreover, this update is seemingly rolling out for Search Labs users in the Google app on Android and iOS. Users are also able to continue their conversations with Search Live even when the app is in the background.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-i-o-2025-the-biggest-announcements-from-ai-to-android-xr">I/O 2025</a> was jam-packed with information regarding AI Mode, Gemini, M3 Expressive for Android, and more. We're here to talk about AI Mode, and that new feature stood out, as Google announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/ai-mode-levels-up-with-new-ai-features-stealing-google-searchs-spotlight">integration with Project Astra</a>. In short, this upgrade will soon bring conversational capabilities to AI Mode when using your phone's camera. The feature will be able to see what you see, taking in everything it needs to before delivering your results.</p><p>Additionally, AI Mode is set to gain <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://deepmind.google/technologies/project-mariner/">Project Mariner's capabilities</a>, too. What this will do is let the feature "understand" all elements of a website. This will take away some manual tasks from the user, like filling your online cart with items to purchase. Instead, you can ask AI Mode to scour the web, find some gameday tickets for you, and it'll do just that.</p> ]]></dc:content>

As part of the event, for example, Samsung is offering a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-s25/buy/galaxy-s25-256gb-unlocked-sm-s931udbexaa/"><strong>free storage boost to 256GB on the Galaxy S25</strong></a> and other phones, with this particular deal offering $70 in savings. Additionally, Samsung will offer buyers up to <strong>$500 in instant trade-in credit on the phone</strong>, along with three free months of Samsung Care Plus, and access to early upgrades through the New Galaxy Club program.</p><p>It's worth noting that the Samsung Galaxy S25 is our pick for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones#section-best-small-phone">best small Android phone</a> on the market. With a really vivid, 6.2-inch AMOLED display and excellent photo and video capabilities, the S25 has a lot to offer to the modern smartphone user. Samsung also guarantees seven Android OS updates, making it more future-proof than some competitors. Similar deals are also available for the S25 Ultra and S25 Edge for a limited time, if you're interested in upgrading from the base model.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="f05f3bdd-02da-4691-b8e3-db34ae703de3" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy S25 (256GB): $859.99" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy S25 (256GB): $859.99" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-s25/buy/galaxy-s25-256gb-unlocked-sm-s931udbexaa/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:554px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="p7pcw6vmJ48V2Sjh6xgGrL" name="Samsung Galaxy S25 in Pinkgold official render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p7pcw6vmJ48V2Sjh6xgGrL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="554" height="554" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy S25 (256GB): </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-s25/buy/galaxy-s25-256gb-unlocked-sm-s931udbexaa/" target="_blank" data-dimension112="f05f3bdd-02da-4691-b8e3-db34ae703de3" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy S25 (256GB): $859.99" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy S25 (256GB): $859.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$859.99</del> <strong>From $299.99 with trade-in during the Discover Samsung event</strong></a></p><p>The 2025 Discover Samsung Sale comes with a ton of nice deals, including free storage boosts for the Galaxy S25, S25 Ultra, and S25 Edge.

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>For a couple of years, every major Android phone launch has been surrounded by people wondering if this will be the phone that works with those nifty <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-and-the-wpc-have-officially-made-qi2-on-android-confusing">magnetic Qi2 chargers</a>. In almost every case, the answer isn't what people want to hear, and it looks like that will be the case with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>, which is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-is-getting-qi2-1">rumored not to include built-in MagSafe charging</a>.</p><p>I've said it before, and I'll say it again: stop expecting it. Not that those magnetic Qi2 chargers aren't handy; I certainly see the appeal to people who can't or won't set their phone down long enough to charge, and millions of dollars have been spent to let you know that you should want it. When a phone launches and you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-buying-time-with-galaxy-s25-qi2-implementation">need to buy a case</a> to use the magnetic accessories, you're disappointed.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:960px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:60.10%;"><img id="gUnm8fpf7MSkase53rkqEh" name="Samsung-galaxy-z-fold-ultra" alt="Samsung teases a Z Fold Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gUnm8fpf7MSkase53rkqEh.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="960" height="577" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Nothing anyone can say is going to change that. But you can find some solace in knowing that you have a new phone that supports <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20231115984149/en/Qi-v2.0-Standard-for-Wireless-Charging-Is-Now-Ready-to-Provide-Enhanced-User-Experience" target="_blank">the technical specifications</a> that are newer, safer, and better, even if you had to buy an ugly case to get the magnetic parts. And you should be thankful the "right" players <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-will-come-to-more-android-phones-in-2025-with-help-from-samsung-and-google">pushed for the latest Qi charging specs to be split off this way</a>, because engineers who design phones surely hate magnets.</p><p>That's half said in jest, but it's partially true: unless you specifically designed a phone with magnets in a particular place, they are going to interfere with the way it's supposed to work. Magnets can mess up electronics, especially a device as complicated as a phone.</p><h2 id="but-apple-can-do-it-2">"But Apple can do it!"</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="psYSd2jGSX3bC8R3dvGC9L" name="Moonside-MagLight-lifestyle-5.jpg" alt="Moonside MagLight and companion accessories" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/psYSd2jGSX3bC8R3dvGC9L.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Yup. And Apple "invented" the idea of using a trio of magnets to hold a wireless charger in the right spot. Then it built a phone around it. It was such a novel idea that Apple wanted to share it and gave it away, becoming part of the Qi2 standards. Thanks, Apple.</p><p>But Samsung is not Apple. Samsung has been working on phone design years ahead of the actual release date, and doesn't want to go back to the drawing board, so it can be more like an iPhone. We probably shouldn't want them to do it, but that means we have to buy a case, and we grumble about it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yEhpLmBzkxgQH49kzCAoNW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-review-08" alt="Galaxy S25 Plus in hand with a case on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yEhpLmBzkxgQH49kzCAoNW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I think the current system works perfectly. If you want to attach your charger, Pop Socket, or whatever else you want with magnets, you can. In the meantime, Samsung doesn't have to scrap a lot of work, and we may get the next big thing we never knew we wanted or needed from them.</p><p>Perhaps it should include a Qi2 Ready case inside the box with the phone instead of charging money for it, though. Just a thought, Samsung.</p><p>One day, we will see a new Samsung Galaxy with magnets built in, just like we'll see a Pixel with them, unless some better way to charge comes along. Maybe even next year. Until then, know that companies aren't doing it to piss you off; they are doing it because it's the best way right now.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p> ]]></dc:content>

For one, it doesn't exclude the part of the market that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks" target="_blank">suffers from PWM</a>, which isn't something that can be said for other flagship tablets.

However, I'm not sure if it's a "me" thing, but I feel like moving the cursor around isn't quite as smooth or fluid as before.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="DAWQLUN7fuKDa8BzyLzkLN" name="NFC logo on the OnePlus Pad 3 Smart Keyboard" alt="NFC logo on the OnePlus Pad 3 Smart Keyboard" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DAWQLUN7fuKDa8BzyLzkLN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1407" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It always seems to stutter at some point, and I can't seem to get the cursor to end up where I want it to be. So instead, I'll just either tap the screen with my finger or use the Stylo 2. I hope this can be remedied with a software update, but it's definitely frustrating.</p><p>What hasn't frustrated me is that you can remove the keyboard from the Pad 3 and still use it. This is an excellent feature, and it's one of the reasons I opted for the Flex Keyboard when I purchased the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/laptops/surface-pro-11-review">Surface Pro 11</a>.

Now that you do, you can take full advantage of it. But there are a few things to note as well.</p><p><strong>You won't lose your playlist</strong></p><p>You don’t need to worry that transferring a playlist from one service to YouTube Music will remove it from that host service. The playlist will still exist there. (Though you will lose access everywhere it exists if you no longer subscribe to a paid service).</p><p><strong>Changes don't sync</strong></p><p>Note that if you make changes to the version of the playlist in YouTube Music, these modifications won’t sync with the other one. So, if you add or remove a song or two, for example, you’ll have to go back to Spotify, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/apple-music-youtube-music-playlist-transfer">Apple Music</a>, or your other service as well to mirror that change manually. If you want to get around that, always update the playlist in the main service then transfer it over again whenever you’ve made big changes so the two playlists are in sync.</p><p><strong>Easily transfer an entire Apple Music library</strong></p><p>A useful tip: if transferring from Apple Music, you can use the handy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/c69125f5226e448dabf4f816c3264388">Add Entire playlist to library shortcut</a> first to instantly create a playlist with all your songs. From there, you can then transfer your entire library to YouTube Music in one fell swoop as a new, massive “playlist”.</p><p><strong>Some songs might not match</strong></p><p>If there are songs that aren’t available on YouTube Music within the playlists you try to transfer, you won’t be able to transfer them. You should receive a notification, however, advising that the song could not be matched. Playlists with podcasts are not supported and cannot be imported to, or exported from, YouTube Music.</p><p><strong>The process can take long for larger playlists</strong></p><p>Since the process can anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours depending on how many playlists you want to transfer and how many songs, plan to do this when you’re at home and can keep your device plugged in and fully charged.</p><h2 id="transfer-away-2">Transfer away!</h2><p>The feature is one of the reasons YouTube Music is among <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">the best streaming music apps</a>. It’s a great way to keep all your favorite playlists from different services in one place, accessing them when and how you want. You can integrate YouTube Music into your existing set-up without having to go through the gruelling task of recreating playlists you already worked so hard to build.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="e30545e5-5a0a-4dee-a048-ec3dfed5e140">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FJQLviZPvGH4qrdXhNCMxG.jpg' alt="YouTube Premium logo"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">YouTube Premium</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Upgrade your experience</strong></em></p><p>YouTube Music is free to access, but there are limitations and ads.

It’s a simple move that could seriously level up scrolling through media in busy group chats.</p><p>At present, you can react or reply to photos and videos in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-first-things-to-do">Google Messages</a>, but every time you do that with another media, it kicks you back to the main chat. This feels a bit annoying when you're trying to go through a bunch of media at once.</p><p>This new way of viewing media is about to address this shortcoming. Instead of leaving one photo and hunting through the chat for the next, you’ll just swipe left or right to flip through recent or older pictures. Plus, a handy bar at the bottom lets you drop comments or reactions without missing a beat.</p><p>Android Authority managed to get this feature up and running and even shared a demo to show how it works in real life.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uboynFivFTc" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><h2 id="lost-media-no-more-digging-2">Lost media? No more digging</h2><p>While swiping through media is a bit more helpful, it won’t cut it for digging up older stuff. That’s why Google is adding a dedicated media overview you can find in the chat details. Tap the new “Images” section, and you’ll get a neat timeline of every photo and video shared, kind of like what you see in some of our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-text-messaging-apps">favorite messaging apps</a>, such as WhatsApp.</p><p>These tweaks might seem small to most, but if you’re always swapping pics and videos, they’ll make a big difference. And Google has been on this grind for a while—earlier this year, it was already testing threaded replies for media, so it’s clear Google wants to make Messages way better for handling visuals.</p><p>It’s still in the works, but it could drop for everyone in the next few months. Either way, it’s shaping up to be a solid upgrade.</p> ]]></dc:content>

I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/power-charging/chargeasap-flash-pro-ultra-25000mah-275w-power-bank-that-does-it-all">tested the Flash Pro Ultra</a> a few weeks ago, and the 25,000mAh power bank held its own against Anker and UGREEN's offerings. The brand also sent over its GaN charger, and I've been using it for the better part of a month now.</p><p>The Zeus ticks all the right boxes: it has four charging ports in total, going up to 140W individually and delivering a total power budget of 280W. That's considerably more than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/ugreen-nexode-pro-gan-chargers-launch">UGREEN Nexode Pro</a> I use while traveling, which hits 160W in total. Another feature I like is that the Zeus has a built-in panel that shows real-time charging details, and this is quite handy — I normally rely on USB-C cables with integrated power meters to see these details.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5121px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.34%;"><img id="TKxccBWr5E8LeTmBYxrNKf" name="Chargeasap Zeus" alt="Chargeasap Zeus 280W GaN charger review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TKxccBWr5E8LeTmBYxrNKf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5121" height="2885" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The downside is the cost; the Zeus <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://chargeasap.com/products/270w-zeus-charger">retails for $219 in the U.S.</a>, and that's more than twice the cost of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Charger-Compact-MacBook-Pixelbook/dp/B0CCVPB4PC">160W Nexode Pro</a>. Clearly, Chargeasap is positioning the additional features as a key selling point of the charger, and it has other niceties — you get a set of plugs in the box that allows the charger to double a global travel plug that can be used anywhere, and that brings much-needed versatility.</p><h2 id="the-zeus-has-unmatched-versatility-2">The Zeus has unmatched versatility</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="ZYcwZw6YyMBktHNQCJopYf" name="Chargeasap Zeus" alt="Chargeasap Zeus 280W GaN charger review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZYcwZw6YyMBktHNQCJopYf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Basically, this is an all-in-one GaN charger that works anywhere in the world, and with the higher power budget, you'll only need the Zeus to charge all of your devices on the go. On that note, the charger is smaller and lighter than most options in this category; a decent achievement considering you're not missing out on any features.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5075px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="weaVod2egrMRdLtAUNGRNf" name="Chargeasap Zeus" alt="Chargeasap Zeus 280W GaN charger review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/weaVod2egrMRdLtAUNGRNf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5075" height="2859" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The rectangular design is easily portable, and I like that the Zeus comes in a white color variant; far too many chargers are just sold in a grey or black color, and the white model stands out. Coming in at 320g, it doesn't weigh too much either, and you get a pouch that holds the travel plugs and the charger with relative ease.</p><h2 id="it-s-designed-to-charge-all-your-devices-at-once-2">It's designed to charge all your devices at once</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5134px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="3W7N9jPsr7smaBdhznFRNf" name="Chargeasap Zeus" alt="Chargeasap Zeus 280W GaN charger review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3W7N9jPsr7smaBdhznFRNf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5134" height="2892" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Coming to connectivity, the Zeus has a single USB-A port that goes up to 65W, and three USB-C ports. The main and secondary USB-C connectors hit 140W over the USB PD 3.1 protocol, and the other port maxes out at 100W. What I like the most is the integrated OLED panel; it shows real-time charging info, and it makes all the difference if you're charging several devices at once — like I do all the time.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="5bAvaF5FRph2dxGCUvWYUf" name="Chargeasap Zeus" alt="Chargeasap Zeus 280W GaN charger review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5bAvaF5FRph2dxGCUvWYUf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The charger has foldable blade plugs as standard, and you can slot in U.K., Australia, and an angled two pin connector if you're traveling. Build quality is great, and I didn't see any issues with the Zeus in the month I used it. It tends to get a little hot when all ports are in use, but that is the case with all GaN chargers, and it doesn't overheat.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="8wTyyDKHsRQ6J2ffvpTXUf" name="Chargeasap Zeus" alt="Chargeasap Zeus 280W GaN charger review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8wTyyDKHsRQ6J2ffvpTXUf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The USB-C port handles PPS up to 65W, making it a good choice if you've got a Samsung device. Interestingly, the USB-A port has the VOOC charging protocol, but it's limited to 22.5W, and I was able to charge the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/oppo-find-x8-ultra-review">Find X8 Ultra</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">Find N5</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-13s-review">OnePlus 13s</a> with relative ease. Of course, you can also use the regular USB-C PD connectivity with these devices now, but if you've got an older BBK phone, the Zeus is definitely handy.</p><h2 id="all-the-power-you-need-anywhere-you-want-it-2">All the power you need — anywhere you want it</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4936px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="3eW9TLroiJtXNxPUtiwn8f" name="Chargeasap Zeus" alt="Chargeasap Zeus 280W GaN charger review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3eW9TLroiJtXNxPUtiwn8f.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4936" height="2780" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another differentiator is that the Zeus is able to handle charging two 140W devices at the same time. That is a big deal, and it allows the charger to go up to 280W in total. This is the rundown of the power budget you get with the Zeus:</p><ul><li><strong>USB-C1/C2 out (140W max):</strong> 5V/3A (15W), 9V/3A (27W), 12V/3A (36W), 15V/3A (45W), 20V/5A (100W), 28V/5A (140W)</li><li><strong>USB-C3 out (100W max): </strong>5V/3A (15W), 9V/3A (27W), 12V/3A (36W), 15V/3A (45W), 20V/5A (100W)</li><li><strong>USB-A out (65W max):</strong> 5V/3A (15W), 4.5V/5A (22.5W), 5V/4.5A (22.5W), 9V/3A (27W), 12V/3A (36W), 15V/3A (45W), 20V/3.25A (65W)</li><li><strong>USB-C1 + C2 out (280W max):</strong> 140W + 140W</li><li><strong>USB-C1/C2 + USB-C3 (240W max): </strong>140W + 100W</li><li><strong>USB-C1 + C2 + C3 (270W max): </strong>140W + 65W + 65W</li><li><strong>USB-C1/C2 + USB-A (205W max): </strong>140W + 65W</li><li><strong>USB-C1 + C2 + USB-A (270W max):</strong> 140W + 65W + 65W</li><li><strong>USB-C1 + C2 + C3 + USB-A (255W max):</strong> 140W + 100W + 15W</li></ul><p>The charging potential is a key advantage, and I was able to use the Zeus with my Honor MagicBook Pro 16, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x200-ultra-review">Vivo X200 Ultra</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-ipad-pro-m4-13-inch-long-term-review">iPad Pro M4</a>, and over a dozen accessories without any issues. The charger delivered consistent power, and I didn't see any issues whatsoever in this regard.</p><p>To sum up, the extensive feature-set combined with 280W power budget means the Zeus is now my go-to choice as a travel GaN charger. It has all the accessories I need while traveling, and having an OLED panel lets me see how long it takes to charge all connected devices. It is on the costlier side, but you also get double the charging potential of most GaN chargers available today, and that's an achievement in and of itself.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="242b11d8-98d6-4d4e-b2be-cf3de8fa92c8">            <a href="https://chargeasap.com/products/270w-zeus-charger" data-model-name="Chargeasap Zeus 280W GaN Charger"><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:102.95%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dNGmon3jovSdW5wpZ9f6YX.jpg' alt="Chargeasap Zeus"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Chargeasap Zeus 280W GaN Charger</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>With all the power you need and a portable design that works globally, the Zeus is one of the best GaN chargers you can buy today. </p></p>                </div>                <div class="pro-con"></div>            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

But the clock is ticking on Samsung's "free" AI features. And at some point, Galaxy Watch owners may have to ask themselves whether they're willing to pay for the best version of Samsung Health.</p><p>It started last year when Samsung revealed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> and wearable insights like Energy Score and AI-based Wellness Tips for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Watch 7</a>. It promised at the time that its AI tricks "will be provided for free until the end of 2025 on supported Samsung Galaxy devices."</p><p>At the January Unpacked, Samsung revealed a much longer list of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/im-more-excited-about-galaxy-unpacked-samsung-health-features-than-galaxy-s25">AI-based health features</a> coming this summer: Vascular Load tracking to determine daily "strain on your heart," a "personal health coach" for LLM-based "insights" for your health questions, an "antioxidant index" with "tailored meal plans and recipes," and mood check-ins.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:64.97%;"><img id="RRQnekYhcCfDoP7UzSmjtC" name="Galaxy-Unpacked-Vascular-Load-example" alt="The Vascular load (Labs) submenu in Samsung Health that shows your heart's activity level from day to day, as well as a summary of the data: "Steady: Your vascular load is consistent.

And we can expect even more, based on this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/one-ui-8-feature-runners-virtual-coach-guidance-rumor">recent leak</a> about a Samsung "Running Coach" that'll have you run for 12 minutes to judge your fitness baseline and then build a "personalized training plan" for you.</p><p>Additionally, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/my-8-favorite-things-about-the-one-ui-8-beta" target="_blank">One UI 8 beta</a> introduced food log reminders and a "Together" feature that challenges your friends to match your weekly running distance.</p><p>Until we hear otherwise, all of this should be free for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8</a> owners. I've been waiting for Samsung to pair its dual-band GPS accuracy with better running guidance and an equivalent to the training load info that Garmin, Apple, and Fitbit offer. That's why the Running Coach-Vascular Load combo sounds tantalizing.</p><p>My worry, though, is that this is all bait on the hook for an eventual Samsung subscription. I could easily see Samsung building up its stockpile of health tools before making a Fitbit Premium or Google One AI equivalent very soon.</p><h2 id="waiting-for-the-other-shoe-to-drop-2">Waiting for the other shoe to drop</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="aicnph6WTXLfmFefVdmFdh" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-and-Watch-6-Classic" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic (left) sitting atop the Galaxy Watch Ultra (right)." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aicnph6WTXLfmFefVdmFdh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In an ideal world, we'd trust that Samsung simply wants to improve its app to make it more competitive against Apple Health, as a boon for people who pay for its products.

Garmin, in particular, held back on releasing new features so that it could shove them all into its subscription and mitigate profit losses from tariffs.</p><p>I'd guess Samsung is taking the reverse approach: It wants to hook us with free Galaxy AI perks, then throw them behind a paywall and deal with the blowback then. After all, it did <em>warn</em> us it would charge for AI eventually.</p><p>Perhaps I'm worrying over nothing, and we'll still receive free auto-generated nutrition plans, running plans, and the health coach's services even after 2025. However, Samsung will examine its health and AI competitors, which charge $10–20 per month, and see that its customers have few alternatives left to turn to.</p><p>If Samsung starts to paywall even some of these tools in 2026, it'll make the Samsung Health experience <em>very</em> different, closer to the free, watered-down version of Fitbit.</p><h2 id="would-you-pay-for-a-samsung-health-subscription-2">Would you pay for a Samsung Health subscription?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CNFEsF8R8aG7BJUiZccGnK" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-ui-8-beta-1-running-together" alt="The Together feature in the Samsung Health app on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CNFEsF8R8aG7BJUiZccGnK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Maybe this speculation is premature. But when I saw that rumor about the Samsung Health Running Coach, exactly what I'd been waiting for, I had to remind myself to look this gift horse in the mouth before letting myself geek out. It's AI-generated, like the other new features.</p><p>I could see Samsung offering one overall Galaxy AI plan for all your devices, similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One</a> AI Pro plan. Or else it could keep the phone AI subscription separate from the Samsung Health Coach subscription.</p><p>So let's assume that Samsung Health goes from a free app to a paywalled one sometime next year. Are you excited enough by AI coaching, nutrition, and health data that you'd pay for it after the free trial ended? Would you continue using Samsung Health but ignore the AI tricks entirely? Or would a paywall push you to look elsewhere for a different fitness app?</p> ]]></dc:content>

Because of the way Android is developed and distributed, you've always been able to build it yourself, to your own specifications.</p><p>Let's be honest, though; it was fun for some people, but traditionally it's been a pain in the ass that few people are able to do. Troubleshooting cryptic commands to build some software overnight that might not even work is something most people don't feel like even trying. I don't blame anyone; it can be a headache, no matter how fun you might find it.</p><p>The good news is that you don't have to do it yourself any longer, and companies like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-murena-one-is-pure-android-not-pure-google">Murena</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/eos-review-privacy-focused-android-without-google">e-foundation</a> are doing all the hard work for you. And you know what? They make a really damn good product, one I think everyone needs to check out for themselves, and it's called /e/OS.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yB5aSK3ZTrZcPkks9nxJVL" name="Murena-Fairphone-4.jpg" alt="Murena Fairphone 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yB5aSK3ZTrZcPkks9nxJVL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Murena)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I don't hate Google. The company does a lot of things I don't like, but it also does a lot of things I do like. I choose to embrace Android for a reason: I think it's the best commercially available platform and offers the most choice, so the things you buy do what you want them to do.</p><p>When you take the best parts of Android and work to turn it into software built for users instead of financial gain, the results are amazing. With the release of /e/OS 3, it's reached the point where it's a good choice for everyone.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pVoaO6sFXZs" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>You have access to every feature you can think of that doesn't require a giant tech company to act as an overseer. Secure cloud backup? It's there. An intuitive interface that can be customized to work best for you? That's there, too.</p><p>So are all the apps you love because it's Android; you can even access a network tool to help you find your phone when you lose it, without Google or Apple shepherding how you're doing it. While the software has been more than usable for a while, the latest version takes the final step. It's as good or better than Google's Android or iOS.</p><p>There are two reasons why now is the perfect time to check out what /e/OS has to offer. First, and most important to a lot of us, is that you probably won't have to spend any money.</p><p>The software is designed to run really well on modest hardware (remember when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-go">Android was that way</a>?), so it will likely work with your last phone if you didn't trade it in for something new and shiny. It will even work well on phones as old as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-pixel-november-update-squashes-the-first-round-of-android-15-bugs">first Google Pixel</a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-5-specs">OnePlus 5</a>. You can find a list of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://doc.e.foundation/devices" target="_blank">221 supported models here</a>, but if you do have a few dollars to spend, you can also buy it preloaded on phones from Murena and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/fairphone-5-ifixit-perfect-repairability-score">Fairphone</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1851px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="GUCSaY8eKAjJMzgxZsQBT" name="e-os-3-smartphone" alt="/e/OS 3 on a smartphone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GUCSaY8eKAjJMzgxZsQBT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1851" height="1041" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Murena)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You can also trust the software, much more than you can trust anything else. I'm not saying you shouldn't trust Google, Apple, or Samsung, but /e/OS is 100% open-source, and an entire development community pores through the code to make sure it does exactly what it is advertised to do. Nothing more, nothing less.</p><p>A good portion of Android is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/aosp" target="_blank">still that way</a>, but much of what you'll find in a new phone comes from Google or the company that made it, and they aren't sharing how it works. To know exactly what a Google Pixel can do, you have to either be part of the development team or trust the development team.</p><p>To know exactly what an /e/OS phone can do, you simply need to read what is made freely available to everyone. No marketing team or sales division is acting as a middleman between you and what you want to know.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1678px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:57.63%;"><img id="4nWrBwRHNS8YAn5VeyQRkA" name="AOSP.jpg" alt="AOSP" src="https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4nWrBwRHNS8YAn5VeyQRkA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1678" height="967" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Trying it is easy, too. You will need a computer with sufficient space to download the installer and files themselves; the process is straightforward. Make sure your phone is up to date, works, and has a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-cables-android-auto">USB cable</a> plugged in. The simple installer walks you through everything else.</p><p>But maybe you're not ready to leave Google or Apple behind, and that's fine. Both companies offer great reasons to buy their products and are a good choice for everyone on most fronts.</p><p>If you're interested in privacy, having a little more control over your digital life, or even curious about what else is out there, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://e.foundation/e-os/" target="_blank">head over to the e-foundation</a> and have a look. I think you'll like what you find.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The video gives viewers a peek into his memorable moments, as he shares stories looking back at some of his photos.</p><p>A short snippet of the video has been doing the rounds on TikTok, where Chan shows off his Pandas to the world. While these Pandas are definitely adorable, what caught our attention was the phone he was using. It looks like one of the latest foldable devices, due to the obviously visible hinge in the center.</p><p>When we looked a little closer, we saw that the phone is small enough to be held in one hand, and sleek too, when unfolded.</p>                    <blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@people/video/7511799977451080990" data-video-id="7511799977451080990" style="max-width: 605px; min-width: 325px;">                        <section>                            <a target="_blank" title="@people" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@people">@people</a>                            <p></p><a target="_blank" title="♬ Lofi - Domknowz" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/Lofi-6799585653702019073">♬ Lofi - Domknowz</a></section>                    </blockquote>                <p>The device's form factor has led us to believe that it could either be the Huawei Mate X6 or the Honor Magic V3. Upon comparing screenshots from the video clip with his Honor Magic V3, Android Central's Nick Sutrich noted that they appeared to be identical phones. He specifically pointed out the battery icon, hinge piece, and corners of the device as being a match to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review">Honor Magic V3</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, others on the team speculate that Jackie Chan actually uses the Huawei Mate X6. It's a bummer that we don't get to see the rear panel of the device; it would've made it easier to guess. As for why we think it's mostly a Huawei Mate X6, it's because Chan has a history of owning Huawei phones.</p><p>The actor has been spotted using Huawei phones since 2016, and in 2019, when a fan gave Jackie a Huawei phone at an event, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://cnalifestyle.channelnewsasia.com/8days/jackie-chan-seen-buying-huawei-phone-once-said-all-chinese-people-should-use-chinese-products-429166">he reportedly pulled out three Huawei phones</a> and said, “I use Huawei and have several of them. Chinese people should use domestic products.

Chan was seen browsing through different models and inquiring about them with Huawei staff.</p><p>According to someone present at the store, the actor wanted to buy the newly launched Mate 60  but was told it was out of stock and could only be pre-ordered. Later, he ended up getting the Huawei Mate X3. Considering Jackie Chan's fascination with the brand, our speculation is leaning towards the fact that the actor owns the new Huawei Mate X6, which was launched in November 2024.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Fortunately, most mobile service providers offer their customers some degree of international coverage, you just need to choose the data plan that works for you (and your budget). </p><p>Up until recently, only the most expensive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/best-unlimited-data-plans">unlimited plans</a> gave users international coverage, but that's swiftly changing as the wireless landscape gets more competitive. The Big Three (Verizon, T-Mobile, and AT&T) already include roaming in Mexico and Canada, but if you want faster speeds or data outside of North America, you'll need to do a little research. Fortunately, whether you're looking to join a Big Three or keep it simple with one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-mvno-carrier">best MVNO carriers</a>, I've gathered all of the best data plans for international travel below.  </p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-at-a-glance"><span>At a glance</span></h3>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_hero" data-id="f1815a52-74d5-492e-96b2-a064b4df3bca">            <a href="https://www.verizon.com/plans/unlimited/" data-model-name="1.

You start by choosing a plan at a base price, and then you mix and match perks based on your needs any given month, each of which cost $10 per month. This can be super convenient if you have a trip coming up, because you can easily plan ahead by adding perks like TravelPass and hotspot data without any real commitment beyond the month in question. </p><p>The Unlimited Ultimate plan also gives you unlimited talk, text, and 15GB of high-speed data in over 200 countries worldwide. Once the 15GB runs out, you'll still get unlimited data at 1.5 Mbps, which is more than sufficient for most simple tasks. With a starting price of $90/month, the Unlimited Ultimate plan can be pretty expensive if you're just signing up for one line, although the price drops considerably when you bring the family along.</p><p>Alternatively, you could also sign up for a more affordable Verizon plan and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.verizon.com/plans/international/international-travel/travel-pass/"><strong>simply use TravelPass</strong></a>. This feature costs $12/day and gives you unlimited talk, text, and data in over 200 countries. Once you add TravelPass to your Verizon account, you'll only be charged for the days you actually use the service, which can come in handy if you generally rely on Wi-Fi calling when overseas. </p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-budget"><span>Best budget</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:801px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:52.06%;"><img id="iW3ezBdsDXPBMzSRVTddME" name="visible-smile-169.JPG" alt="Visible smile logo on phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iW3ezBdsDXPBMzSRVTddME.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="801" height="417" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Visible)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="2-visible-plus-pro-2"><span class="title__text"><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/visible-review">2.

You also get 4K UHD streaming quality, unlimited mobile hotspot data, and a five-year price guarantee so you won't have to worry about your phone bill suddenly getting more expensive. </p><p>Travelers will enjoy free talk, text, and 2GB of data in Mexico, Canada, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands, after which speeds will begin to slow. Subscribers to the Plus Pro plan will also get two days of Global Pass every month, which gives you unlimited talk, text, and 2GB of high-speed data in over 140 countries worldwide. That may not seem very generous, but you can also save up to 12 of these unused Global Pass days to use when traveling, which is pretty good for only $45 per month. Alternatively, you can pay for the annual version of the Visible Plus Pro plan and receive 24 Global Pass days to use at your convenience. Global Pass can also be purchased a la carte for $10 per day. </p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-premium"><span>Best premium</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1990px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="BvTcxLK4iRKgLdiYgUZd9T" name="T-Mobile-Store.jpeg" alt="T-Mobile store sign" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BvTcxLK4iRKgLdiYgUZd9T.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1990" height="1119" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="3-t-mobile-experience-beyond-2"><span class="title__text">3.

There are also a few surprising perks that I haven't seen anywhere else, such as free in-flight Wi-Fi and discounted hotels and rental cars if you book through T-Mobile Travel. International calling will still cost $0.25 per minute, but it's easy enough to just use Wi-Fi calling when you're overseas. </p><p>The problem is that the Experience Beyond plan is quite expensive, costing over $100 per month for a single line. Do the fancy benefits justify the price? That's between you and your bank account. </p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-for-latin-america"><span>Best for Latin America</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PiBkgfhxJthnGb8s3m3nFL" name="att-logo-with-lloyd.jpg" alt="AT&T Logo with AC mascot" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PiBkgfhxJthnGb8s3m3nFL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4800" height="2700" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AT&T)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="4-at-t-unlimited-premium-pl-2"><span class="title__text">4.

It's also home to Unlimited Premium, an interesting data plan that offers users a bounty of compelling perks, such as 100GB of Cloud storage, six months of YouTube Premium streaming, free service on select <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">smartwatches</a>, and more. </p><p>The plan also offers a bunch of international benefits that may sound familiar if you read up on T-Mobile's Experience Beyond plan. I'm talking about unlimited text and 50GB of high-speed data (then 256 kbps) in over 200 destinations worldwide, plus free calls, texts, and data in Mexico and Canada. Use a 5G-compatible <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> and you'll even get 5G service in over 90 of the aforementioned countries. </p><p>Google Fi's Unlimited Premium plan starts at $65 per month for a single line, but you'll save some cash by adding up to four lines on your account. All things said and done, it's a pretty reasonable price for what you get, as long as you don't rack up costs overseas with those $0.20/minute phone calls.</p><ul><li><a href="#main"><strong>Back to the top^</strong></a></li></ul><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-choose"><span>How to choose</span></h3><p>There are plenty of great <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cell-phone-plans">phone plans</a> for folks who regularly travel abroad, but that doesn't mean that there's a one-size-fits-all solution. Before you settle on one plan, it's important to consider your needs as a device user, your budget, and of course, your destination. </p><p>For starters, it's best to look at your current wireless plan and see what it offers. Do you only need talk and text on your travels? If so, how much? Do you need data for navigation or surfing the web? Asking yourself these questions is a great place to start when choosing a plan for your journey. And who knows, maybe your carrier already has a great option that'll work for you. </p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vBJsLpu2HdkkTFV4avmuSi" name="visible-sim-card-passport-hero.jpeg" alt="Visible SIM card sitting on top of US passport" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vBJsLpu2HdkkTFV4avmuSi.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you can't get coverage from within your destination of choice, you could also look into your carrier's Wi-Fi calling policy. Wi-Fi is readily available in most countries across the globe, and if you don't frequently send texts or use data while traveling, it could be sufficient for your needs abroad.</p><p>Another piece of advice I'd offer is to watch out for <em>how </em>carriers describe their international coverage. For example, there's a big difference between "free calls <em><strong>in </strong></em>XX countries" and "free calls <em><strong>to </strong></em>XX countries". Both are useful perks, but they mean very different things. One will let you make calls from inside another country, while the latter example means that you can only call other countries from <em>inside the United States. </em>It may seem like an obvious distinction, but it's easy to get mixed up if you aren't careful. </p><p>Lastly, it's important to remember that many carriers offer international coverage a la carte, so you may not need to switch to an entirely new plan to use your provider's network overseas. Verizon, for instance, offers TravelPass in over 210 countries worldwide. It costs just $12 per day and can easily be activated on any of Verizon's data plans.</p> ]]></dc:content>

There's an entire category of headphones and earbuds you may not be as familiar with: sleep headphones. These products can simultaneously block out unwanted sounds and play your favorite music, podcasts, or white noise to ensure you get a perfect night sleep, whether you're in your bed or on a flight overseas.</p><p>If you've ever tried wearing some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">best wireless earbuds</a> to bed, you probably know that regular earbuds aren't that comfortable for sleep. That's why <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/quieton-31-sleep-earbuds-review">sleep earbuds</a>, sleep headbands, and sleep over-ears exist — they are designed specifically for comfort in all sleeping positions. Most sleep earbuds are characterized by a low-profile design that rests within your ear canal, while open earbuds, sleep headbands, and sleep over-ears avoid it altogether.</p><p>There are a bunch of different reasons for why you might want to wear a pair of earbuds or headphones to sleep. Maybe you sleep with someone who snores or live next to a noisy train station. While traveling, you might want to block out airplane turbulence or car noise to catch some sleep. Whatever your needs are, these best sleep headphones and earbuds will help you get the perfect night's sleep.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_hero" data-id="5916d48b-4a68-46fc-b4b0-10c19d48d9d5">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9YcaTcDkUmB766JceRMYbk.jpg' alt="A product render of the Anker Soundcore Sleep A20 against a white background."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Anker Soundcore Sleep A20</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Best overall</strong></em></p><p>Anker's Soundcore Sleep A20 hit all the right notes, providing comfort and battery life at an affordable price point. The earbuds' low profile mean people can wear them to sleep regardless of their sleeping position, including side sleepers. In sleep mode, the Sleep A20 can last for 14 hours straight, for a total of 80 hours with the charging case. You also get a digital sound library of sleep sounds and Bluetooth 5.3 support for playing anything you'd like. </p></p>                </div>                <div class="pro-con"></div>            </div>        </div>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_hero" data-id="a9a91468-b2aa-411b-a4e8-82929eca031e">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AAnMyexpeTfzZok2vd3cJh.jpg' alt="The Anker Soundcore Sleep A10 product render against a white background."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Anker Soundcore Sleep A10</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Best budget pick</strong></em></p><p>If you like the Soundcore Sleep A20 but wish they were a bit cheaper, the Sleep A10 are your perfect sleepbuds. They're slim and designed for side sleepers just like the newer model, and are cheaper. With a more modest 10-hour battery life in sleep mode, these will still get you through the night. Passive noise canceling and low-frequency audio production help make this a great budget choice for a good night's sleep. </p></p>                </div>                <div class="pro-con"></div>            </div>        </div>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_hero" data-id="5c157a94-f31e-4386-aa63-251797532c7b">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/szqDkb46mgzcshziHwHpU9.jpg' alt="The Ozlo Sleepbuds product render against a white background."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Ozlo Sleepbuds</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Best premium pick</strong></em></p><p>For those who want the absolute best sleep earbuds, there are the Ozlo Sleepbuds.

The closest thing to a one-size-fits-all solution are the Anker Soundcore Sleep A20, which are affordable and comfortable sleepbuds aimed to fit in a variety of sleeping styles. They have neat tech inside, including an MEMS electrical sensor to track your sleep and create a quality score. With these earbuds, you may be able to ditch your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">smartwatch</a> or fitness band.</p><p>The Sleep A20 earbuds come with a pre-loaded sleep sound library, but also work as standard Bluetooth earbuds. In sleep mode, you can get up to 14 hours of battery life on a single charge — that's more than enough for even the longest snooze sessions. At $160, the Anker Soundcore Sleep A20 strike a nice balance between premium features and affordability.</p><p>Those on a budget might prefer the Anker Soundcore Sleep A10, the older model that's available for a $30 discount, sometimes more. It still offers solid battery life and features aimed to help you get a good night's sleep.</p><p>On the other end of the spectrum, there are the Ozlo Sleepbuds, which cost a lump sum of $350. For that, you get a premium set of earbuds and a companion charging case with a bunch of sensors and features. The earbuds include a sleep-detecting accelerometer, and the case offers a tap detection, ambient noise detection, an ambient temperature sensor, and an ambient light sensor. All these factors can be used to determine your quality of sleep, and a built-in alarm helps you wake up.</p><p>Plus, you get Bluetooth Low Energy support for ultra-low power draw and Android features like Auracast. Though, for many, the price is too high with limited feature advantages compared to the Sleep A20.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rPyAhMqzK2ox3a94gBShWZ" name="nothing-ear-open-cu-in-hand-cu.jpg" alt="Nothing Ear (open)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rPyAhMqzK2ox3a94gBShWZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Having anything in your ear can be uncomfortable for some sleepers. If that sounds like you, we have some outside-the-box picks for favorable sleeping environments. For starters, you can consider the SleepPhones — a headband that covers your eyes and sports inbuilt speakers for media playback outside your ear canal.</p><p>There are also the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/nothing-ear-open-review">Nothing Ear Open</a>, which are open-ear buds that remain outside your ear canal. They're bulkier than the other in-ear options, but can be used in a variety of situations, like fitness and everyday wear. Side sleepers should pass on the Nothing Ear Open, but they're an excellent option for people who sleep on their back or stomach. Side sleepers can also opt to only wear one earbuds for a more relaxing experience.</p><p>A pair of over-ear headphones can come in handy for sleeping in upright positions, making them an amazing choice for airplane trips, train rides, and long road trips. For that, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sonos-ace-review">Sonos Ace</a> are impossible to beat. They feature comfortable memory foam and vegan leather materials for comfortability and aren't too heavy. Plus, you get active noise-canceling — most in-ear sleepbuds only use passive sound isolation.</p><p>With USB-C and a 30-hour battery life with ANC active, the Sonos Ace can be your travel companion every step of the way. They're a great pair of everyday headphones, too.</p><p>When choosing a pair of sleep headphones, you should consider whether you're willing to spend money on a dedicated care of night earbuds. If you aren't, the Nothing Ear Open or Sonos Ace may be a more value-oriented option, as they can be used all day <em>and</em> all night. Regardless, you can't go wrong with any of the headphones or earbuds on this list for sleep.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Google says these auxiliary systems will include users with a video production tool, an external camera, or a document camera. What's bringing this capability is a new option within your <strong>Settings > General </strong>tab.</p><p>Users will find a new "Share content from camera" toggle. After enabling, users should find their external cameras within the Presentation icon's "Camera" option in a meeting.</p><p>Google threw in something extra, stating its support for external cameras will bring 1080p and 30fps streaming quality.</p><p>While sharing external content becomes easier, Google Meet's update adds extra improvements for device-based presentations. The post states screen shares will have upgraded video quality, which improves the viewing experience when the presenter is scrolling or showing a video. Starting a screen share becomes faster, alongside a small UI update to make starting presentations and controlling them easier.</p><p>Google ends by stating a small QoL update lets an older presentation resume if a second presenter ends their sharing session.</p><h2 id="google-meet-s-in-the-spotlight-2">Google Meet's in the Spotlight</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1047px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:57.31%;"><img id="exPxz2Jc6wy6MWCyfnrs7A" name="google-meet-share-content-from-camera-example" alt="Google Meet's latest update brings a "share content from camera" option for external camera use." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/exPxz2Jc6wy6MWCyfnrs7A.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1047" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1036px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:57.92%;"><img id="swrbG79YWSHtD5LgQ9kZ8A" name="google-meet-external-camera-selection-ui" alt="Google's external camera update for Meet lets users select which camera to use when beginning a presentation." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/swrbG79YWSHtD5LgQ9kZ8A.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1036" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>It seems this update isn't coming to regular end-users, as Google's patch notes only highlight Workspace users. Those with Business, Enterprise, Frontline (Standard), Enterprise Essentials and Enterprise Essentials Plus, Education Plus, and individual Workspace consumers will see these Meet updates.</p><p>Those on Google's rapid-release domain will see the update beginning this week (June 4), while those on the Scheduled-release domain will begin on June 11. The update should wrap up in ~15 days for both domains.</p><p>Google's been improving the Meet experience since earlier this year when an update for Android brought a redesign and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-mixed-things-up-with-its-meet-redesign">a spotlight on emoji reactions</a>. The company said that update from February is designed to "organize features more intuitively." Moreover, emoji reactions took a front row seat during conference calls, so users can quickly react without playing with menus.</p><p>For computers, Google Meet started rolling out its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-meet-color-sampling-tile-redesign-rolls-out">classy new tile design</a> for callers in April. Meet now utilizes its "color-sampling" capabilities to grab colors from your profile picture and apply them to your card's background. It's also worth mentioning that Google Meet will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-meet-to-sunset-legacy-duo-features-in-september">soon sunset all legacy Duo features</a> in September.

However, to combat this, Samsung developed software to "detect" signs of sleep apnea via the Galaxy Watch, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-expands-global-availability-of-sleep-apnea-feature-on-galaxy-watch-series">that's now rolling out to more people</a> globally. In a blog post, the Korean OEM states its sleep apnea detection feature on the Galaxy Watch is arriving via the Samsung Health Monitor app in 34 European markets.</p><p>The company warns that "availability may vary depending on country-specific registration in some European markets."</p><p>Samsung states this is possible due to the feature's recent reception of CE marking in the European Economic Area. This marking states the Galaxy Watch's sleep apnea feature has met the European Union's health, safety, and environmental standards for consumers.</p><p>More than that, Samsung is bringing sleep apnea detection to users in Australia and Singapore. The company states it also had to walk through the appropriate governmental processes in order to bring the feature here, as well. The feature has obtained clearance via Singapore’s Health Sciences Authority and the Therapeutic Goods Administration in Australia.</p><p>Consumers in these regions with a Galaxy Watch 4 series device <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-hands-on">or newer</a> (with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> or higher) will have access to Sleep Apnea.</p><h2 id="improving-sleep-2">Improving Sleep</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:907px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.15%;"><img id="cFLw2jEqX3jvMiHKepaLyX" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-sleep-apnea-global-expansion" alt="Samsung's Sleep Apnea feature present on a Galaxy Watch." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cFLw2jEqX3jvMiHKepaLyX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="907" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung's been on a journey to improve users' sleep health via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-could-detect-blood-pressure-sleep-apnea-like-galaxy-watch">this Sleep Apnea feature since 2023</a>. It was then that the Korean OEM announced its sleep health feature had successfully passed through South Korea's Ministry of Food and Drug Safety. This meant the feature could launch on supported Galaxy Watches in the country as soon as "early 2024."</p><p>The Sleep Apnea feature leverages the Galaxy Watch's BioActive Sensor to alert users to potential signs of the medical condition. While Samsung says it is useful, it's not recommended for those who've already been diagnosed with sleep apnea.</p><p>Luckily for U.S. folks, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-sleep-apnea-detection-us-fda-approval">the FDA passed Samsung's feature</a> through, meaning it could arrive on Galaxy Watches in the States. That announcement stated the feature could be utilized by consumers aged 22 or older; however, there's a requirement for the watch. If you're interested, you must wear your Galaxy Watch to bed as often as possible. Samsung says the device needs to track your sleep for more than four hours within a ten-day timespan.</p><ul><li><strong>Smartwatch deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/searchpage.jsp?st=smartwatch&_dyncharset=UTF-8&_dynSessConf=&id=pcat17071&type=page&sc=Global&cp=1&nrp=&sp=&qp=&list=n&af=true&iht=y&usc=All+Categories&ks=960&keys=keys"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/search?q=smartwatch"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=smartwatch&crid=19YAPQ38561AK&sprefix=smartwatch%2Caps%2C138&ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_1_10"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/watches-audio-accessories-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/search/smartwatch"><u><strong>Dell</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Android Authority surmises that they may be different tones for the beginning and ending of a recording session.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HV4oFxou98WazcAsXE34KC" name="google-pixel-9-call-notes-transcript.jpg" alt="Call Notes summary and transcript on the Google Pixel 9 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HV4oFxou98WazcAsXE34KC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A chime or tone would make it harder for the average person to discern whether their call is being recorded with Call Notes. Unless you're a Pixel user with access to the feature, it's unlikely that you'd know these new Call Notes sounds are really disclaimers that a conversation is being recorded.</p><p>Of course, there is a clear benefit to people recording who want to be subtle, as this feature could remove the awkwardness that the current level of transparency can create.</p><p>At the moment, it's unclear when, or if, this feature will arrive in the stable Phone by Google app. The fact that it is visible in the Phone by Google app beta signals that this is something Google is toying with, but it's not a confirmation that a change will certainly be made.

The user states they've noticed this updated design surface on their Galaxy Z Fold 6, as of Wednesday, June 4. This isn't on the stable version of Google Messages, as the publication states, but it seems more users with the app's beta version are noticing it.</p><p>The Reddit post offered a few screenshots, which showcase a slight change to the app's text field menus, specifically for emojis and the plus icon.</p><p>It seems Google is working on reworking its tabs for Photomoji, Emoji, GIFS, and Stickers. These options are housed in a pill-shaped container, instead of being listed beside each other without any barriers. When tapped, the selected option will take on a more colorful aesthetic, per your Material 3 Expressive choice. The publication calls this a "connected button group," which seems apt.</p><p>Regarding the plus icon, the user noticed the options there are seemingly a little larger in circular boxes and slightly more spread apart.</p><h2 id="google-s-moving-ahead-2">Google's moving ahead</h2><blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages/comments/1l3kfvd/material_3_expressive_on_galaxy_z_fold6">Material 3 Expressive on Galaxy Z Fold6</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages">r/GoogleMessages</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><p>On the other hand, where your texts are displayed, sees a slight change, as Google works in a solid-colored background. The chat bubbles seemingly remain the same; however, the texting field (the conversation) is now housed inside a rounded-corner container. As 9to5 notes, this creates a separation between your conversations and your standard calling, video calling, and menu buttons.</p><p>If you are in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.google.android.apps.messaging/join">Google Messages beta</a>, you may begin seeing this UI update as we close the week. One user with a Galaxy S25 Ultra has yet to see it, so the small update is likely still making its rounds.</p><p>It was during I/O 2025 when Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-unveils-the-most-massive-android-redesign-ever">unveiled its biggest Android redesign</a>: Material 3 Expressive. The company states this new design will focus on designs that feel good and make sense while helping you get more things done. M3 Expressive will lean heavily on colors and shapes to bring Android into this new generation of design. The entirety of the Android OS is expected to take on M3 Expressive, as well as several of Google's apps.</p><p>We've already seen some of these <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gmail/gmails-new-material-3-expressive-design-is-secretly-hitting-some-inboxes">new Expressive changes in other apps,</a> like Gmail.

Now Garmin has thrown its hat in the ring with a U.S. patent for tracking your glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels.</p><p>You can use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ppubs.uspto.gov/pubwebapp/static/pages/ppubsbasic.html">U.S. patent search</a> to find patent number "20250134464," which outlines how Garmin could use its watches' photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals — commonly used for heart rate and blood oxygen — to determine a "user's glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level."</p><p>As the patent explains, HbA1c checks the volume percentage of your blood's hemoglobin proteins that are "glycated," or bound or coated with glucose. Because glucose stays attached to red blood cells for their four-month lifespan, HbA1c "provides a long-term indication of the average blood glucose level...and is typically not impacted substantially by a single meal or activity."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2550px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="b4AGgPiVyDirFpJekzHyRR" name="Garmin-blood-glucose-patent-figure-4a" alt="A Garmin patent figure showing an "electronic fitness device" placing pressure on "human tissue," with various components calculating the level of pressure and sending it to the processor along with PPG data." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b4AGgPiVyDirFpJekzHyRR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2550" height="1434" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p>"Determining and monitoring HbA1c levels can help with the management of glucose and insulin," the patent continues, as diabetics want to maintain their blood levels below 7%. And lowering it below 5% "is believed to improve and maintain an individual's overall health."</p><p>Since, currently, people must draw blood to test levels, it's easy for people to be unaware of their growing HbA1c levels, or to avoid frequent testing because of the discomfort. That's why this "would be of great benefit to users of a wrist-worn device," to have this data available painlessly and continuously, the patent suggests.</p><p>This patented tool wouldn't replace the spot-check blood tests diabetics use on a daily basis. For that, Garmin partnered with Dexcom so you can continuously see your mg/dl of glucose from an attached Dexcom patch on your Garmin watch.</p><p>Instead, this seems more like a preventative tool that would warn prediabetics of bad glucose trends and encourage better fitness and nutritional habits to bring down your HbA1c gradually over weeks and months.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="QEBmLRKeY5w3sQJqFyXZQR" name="Garmin-blood-glucose-patent-figure-2b" alt="A Garmin patent figure showing the bottom sensors of a Garmin watch, with dotted lines pointing to a zoomed-in look at the sensors with various labeled components." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QEBmLRKeY5w3sQJqFyXZQR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What's the hold-up on seeing this feature in Garmin watches now? The patent warns that "conventional electronic fitness devices" will struggle to provide accurate data in this area. Pressure from a tight band can compress your blood vessels, and the size of your ligaments and bones will also skew the results.</p><p>So the watch's processor will need to determine a "pressure metric value" to compensate for these effects and provide accurate results. Garmin's patent outlines how it will attempt to pull this off, but it'll need FDA levels of accuracy before we'd ever see this HbA1c tracking feature in a consumer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a>.</p><p>Samsung execs have openly shared plans to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-exec-health-forum-glucose-monitoring-highlighted">put blood glucose tracking in a Galaxy Watch</a>, while Apple is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/31/apple-watch-glucose-monitoring-feature/">"many years away" from glucose tracking</a> despite several patents on the subject. We've even seen a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/circular-ring-2-heart-health-glucose-trends-annoucement">smart ring promise non-invasive blood glucose data soon</a>. It's no surprise, in other words, that Garmin would try to keep up with its rivals.</p><p>Interestingly, the patent also suggests its pulse spectrometry method could determine other chemical levels like SHb and MHb, signaling rare blood disorders where iron or sulfur binds with hemoglobin and interferes with your blood oxygen levels. And it would determine levels of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood, which could help catch other medical conditions.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="e2btkgXUAf9EJFtmPkPynX" name="Garmin-Fenix-8-bottom-sensors" alt="The bottom of the titanium Garmin Fenix 8, showing the charging port, QuickFit watch band connectors, and etched info about the watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e2btkgXUAf9EJFtmPkPynX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Many patents never see the light of day in consumer products. In this case, no smartwatch brand has offered blood glucose monitoring yet because of the inherent challenges of delivering accurate results.</p><p>So anyone concerned about their blood glucose levels shouldn't go out and buy a Garmin watch just yet.

In short, this test puts Chrome on trial, seeing how well its "critical components" perform within the Blink rendering engine. In the recent 139 dev build test, which Chrome conducted on an Apple MacBook Pro M4 with iOS 15, the browser achieved a score of 52.35, its highest yet.</p><p>While this beats out how Chrome <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.chromium.org/search/label/the%20fast%20and%20the%20curious">scored last year</a> on the Speedometer 3 test, Google says this is all thanks to several additional optimizations.</p><p>It's not a huge number; however, Google states its optimizations have resulted in a 10% overall improvement for Chrome since August 2024. Google says this 10% boost could save all Chrome users roughly "58 million hours" when browsing, thanks to reduced website loading times.</p><p>To do this, the company says its Chrome team "focused on refining fundamental rendering paths across the entire stack." But achieving faster browsing speeds also meant Google needed to rethink how the browser leverages a computer's CPU caches.</p><p>Moreover, Chrome's improvements saw a major shift in how it optimized memory layouts. Google's team also reduced the number of "non-relevant" items Chrome caches. The post adds that an update to Chrome's usage of Apple Advanced Typography technology (for font shaping performance) speeds up the browser wherever text is.</p><h2 id="chrome-s-getting-faster-2">Chrome's getting faster</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MoqaNuc7sYrwQGd2Usbkcj" name="Google-Chrome-Android.jpg" alt="Google Chrome logo on a phone screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MoqaNuc7sYrwQGd2Usbkcj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google Chrome has consistently worked on its browsing speed in recent history, and its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chrome-blows-the-competition-away-in-speedometer-3-tests">stunning Speedometer 3 tests</a> in 2024 were no exception. Since the benchmark debuted, Google said its browser improved by roughly 72%. What it highlighted last year was optimization for slower functions, which directly contributed to Chrome's overall speed increase.</p><p>Additionally, Google said Chrome was outfitted with better memory usage when drawing shapes while also cutting out "redundant" processes.</p><p>The latest test and the one from 2024 focused on computers, but that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chrome-doubled-its-speedometer-scores-on-android-with-the-help-of-snapdragon-8-elite">doesn't mean Android phones were left out</a>, especially those with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>. A new version of Chrome, specifically enhanced for higher-end Android devices, doubled its old score on the Speedometer 2.1 test. There's no single way users will notice Chrome's improvements on mobile devices, as Google says these upgrades will affect all facets of browsing. Opening large documents should be a lot smoother and quicker, just to name an aspect.</p><p>With Qualcomm's latest flagship chip, Chrome on Android scored 33.3, blowing its old 18.4 score out of the water.</p><p>Regarding its recent test, Google says it will continue to enhance Chrome's browsing capabilities, and more updates will be on the way.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The tablet is believed to be coming in only one colorway, the Storm Blue.</p><p>The screen boasts of being the best tablet display, measuring 13.2 inches, featuring 3.4K resolution, and a 7:5 aspect ratio. Underneath, alongside the flagship Qualcomm chipset, it features 12GB of RAM and 256GB of onboard storage. Additionally, it also has a vapor chamber cooling system to ensure users have a smoother high-end gaming experience.</p><p>The prominent aspect of the OnePlus Pad 3 is its massive 12,140mAh battery capacity, with support for 80W Supervooc charging. It promises 17-hour-long video playback, 70 days of standby, an extra 18 percent battery with a quick 10-minute charge. An additional perk here happens to be the inclusion of an 80W charger for buyers in the U.S. and Canada.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="dMmvFb94iBy4sRar8eZMwS" name="OnePlus-Pad-3-04" alt="OnePlus Pad 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dMmvFb94iBy4sRar8eZMwS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure><p>OnePlus Pad 3 is shipping with Android 15-based <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/oneplus-releases-android-15-based-oxygenos-15-heres-when-your-phone-will-get-the-update">OxygenOS 15</a> and is further promised with three years of Android OS updates and six years of bi-monthly security updates.

Rumors have swirled about Apple creating an ultra-slim iPhone 17 Air, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review">Galaxy S25 Edge</a> was soon teased in January 2025, launching in May. While the company may have thought it had finally won a major race against the Cupertino-based tech giant, the Galaxy S25 Edge might turn out to be yet another case of Samsung focusing and allocating resources in the wrong places.</p><p>I bought the Galaxy S25 Edge, and even <em>I </em>can see the phone's apparent flaws. I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/3-reasons-id-instantly-buy-an-ultra-slim-phone-like-the-rumored-galaxy-s25-slim">asked for Samsung to make this kind of ultra-thin smartphone</a> way back in November, in fact. To make this kind of controversial, niche device a hit, Samsung needs to address its flaws head-on. Not pretend they don't exist, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-top-exec-addresses-galaxy-s25-edge-battery-woes">which is what it's doing</a>.</p><p>Even fans of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy">Samsung Galaxy</a> product line seem to <em>hate</em> the Edge, and that isn't an exaggeration. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/samsunggalaxy/comments/1kltccf/what_are_your_thoughts_on_the_galaxy_s25_edge/" target="_blank">Posts</a> on the Samsung Galaxy subreddit — a place where you'd expect the sentiment around Samsung devices to be somewhat favorable — are littered with complaints about the new device. One comment called the Galaxy S25 Edge the "dumbest Samsung ever" and added that it was "overpriced, unnecessary, and false advertisement." It has over 100 upvotes.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ErMAYgHCMkvNch3RFBGxvZ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-5" alt="The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge compared to an iPhone 16 Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ErMAYgHCMkvNch3RFBGxvZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge (left) compared to the iPhone 16 Pro (right). </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s25-edges-early-sales-seem-to-be-as-slim-as-the-phone-new-report-claims">hasn't disclosed early sales figures for the Galaxy S25 Edge</a>, which is somewhat odd for the company. It often shares sales data from its pre-order and launch period in its home market of South Korea, but it neglected to do so for this launch. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-is-struggling-to-sell-the-galaxy-s25-edge/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a> reports that its sources say sales are below expectations for the smartphone.</p><p>If that's true, I'm not surprised. Samsung's messaging regarding the Galaxy S25 Edge has been far from clear. Instead of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/doechii-x-edge-live-event/" target="_blank">collaborating with Doechii</a>, the brand should have tried to convince people that the Galaxy S25 Edge <em>isn't</em> a flawed smartphone. Samsung should remind them that all the thick, heavy, and bulky smartphones on the market are really the flawed ones.</p><p>That's why I bought the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-vs-iphone-16-pro">to replace my iPhone 16 Pro</a>. The latter is thick and heavy to the point that it's inconvenient. All the feature advantages it has over the Galaxy S25 Edge are inconsequential because of its size. I don't want to hold the phone up at a concert and use its 5x telephoto lens because it's heavy. Nor do I want to keep it in my pocket at the gym, or fight a weight imbalance when using the on-screen keyboard.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tuPHaVDkhBn62k9zCiCyUZ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-6" alt="The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge with an Anker MagSafe battery pack attached." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tuPHaVDkhBn62k9zCiCyUZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Galaxy S25 Edge can go more places and do more things <em>because</em> it is thin, not in spite of its thickness. The battery life issue is wildly overblown — just buy a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-battery-packs">MagSafe/Qi2 battery pack</a> and stop worrying about it altogether. Charge your phone when you can throughout the day, like in your car or at your desk, and the Galaxy S25 Edge can free you from a big-battery smartphone that feels like a brick.</p><p>That's how I would've pitched the Galaxy S25 Edge to smartphone users. Samsung didn't do any of that, and it could be a fatal error for the Galaxy S25 Edge.</p><h2 id="once-again-samsung-isn-t-listening-2">Once again, Samsung isn't listening</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CoozfCZjnHhMrYZN66rw4Z" name="Galaxy-S25-Edge-Silver-Back-Camera-Lenses-10" alt="Dual cameras on the Galaxy S25 Edge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CoozfCZjnHhMrYZN66rw4Z.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's a classic case of Samsung not listening to or understanding its customers. Last year, Samsung copied Apple in designing the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">Galaxy Buds 3 Pro</a>. Things got so bad a Samsung executive was reportedly furious with the so-called "design plagiarism."</p><p>More recently, Samsung introduced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review">One UI 7</a> with iOS-like features, such as a split notification shade and quick settings panel. Longtime <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oneui/comments/1kk9kxe/oneui_70_is_now_too_ios_for_me/" target="_blank">Galaxy users aren't happy</a>. And to top things off, the Galaxy S25 Edge looks like a carbon copy of the iPhone 16 from the back.</p><p>All these controversial changes aren't working. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/insight/top-10-bestselling-smartphones-q1-2025/" target="_blank">Counterpoint Research</a> recently revealed that the top four best-selling smartphones in the first quarter of 2025 were all iPhones.

For perspective, the Galaxy S24 Ultra was the fifth best-selling phone in Q1 2024 a year ago — also behind four iPhones.</p><p>Samsung doesn't appear to be adapting or adjusting to feedback.

It's a cool idea, but it probably won’t cut it for serious gaming. That said, Puffin showing up doesn’t rule out a more classic Quest-style headset could still be in the pipeline later on.</p><p>Additionally, Puffin is said to focus on virtual screens, letting you set up a whole multi-monitor setup in VR.

I would argue that 2023's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review" target="_blank">Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses</a> were the first smart glasses product that made any real waves in the sector, and even then, that didn't even happen until Meta AI support was rolled out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-multimodal-ai-video-calling-update" target="_blank">six months after launch</a>.</p><p>Now, we're looking at a year where we could see a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-with-display-rumor">third-generation Ray-Ban Meta</a> release alongside a new pair of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/my-demo-with-googles-ar-glasses-went-better-than-the-one-on-stage">Google AR glasses</a>, as well as a smattering of other companies, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-project-aura-google-io-2025-xreal-eye" target="_blank">such as</a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-project-aura-google-io-2025-xreal-eye"> Xreal</a>.</p><p>However, none of these glasses appear to be as advanced as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Meta Orion</a>, which felt very much like a pair of glasses with a Meta Quest headset somehow crammed inside. Of course, there's a very good reason for that: cost. In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynLm-QvsW0Q">an in-depth interview</a> last October, Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth noted that production-level Orion glasses would cost $10,000 a pair if Meta started selling them last Fall.</p><div><blockquote><p>What better way to fund expensive assembly lines than with the help of seemingly unlimited military budgets?</p></blockquote></div><p>That's because the technology to mass-produce something like Orion simply doesn't exist. It could be built, yes, but it would cost <em>billions</em> to do it, and that cost would have to be passed on to the consumer in the form of $10,000 glasses that only a few rich enthusiasts would be able to justify.</p><p>So, what better outlet to fund this eventual road to commercialization than the U.S. government, and more specifically, the U.S. military? After all, the 2025 fiscal budget alone for the Department of Defence amounts to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3703410/department-of-defense-releases-the-presidents-fiscal-year-2025-defense-budget/#:~:text=The%20President%27s%20Fiscal%20Year%202025%20Budget%20Request%20for%20the%20Department,people%2C%20and%20succeeding%20through%20teamwork." target="_blank">$849.8 billion</a>, or roughly 14 times what Meta has spent on R&D over the past decade.</p><p>The military won't be terribly concerned with $10,000 glasses if they can finally achieve the goal Microsoft's Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS) project tried to achieve in 2021 for the cost of around $20 billion. Anduril took over that contract this year in February, and now it's partnering with Meta to ensure its cutting-edge AI-powered software is backed by Meta's bleeding-edge AR hardware.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZgJbwGhdEApmwWDwVfTiM6" name="meta-project-orion-ar-glasses-hands-on-04.jpg" alt="Photo of Nick Sutrich wearing and using the Meta Orion AR glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZgJbwGhdEApmwWDwVfTiM6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Palmer Luckey's return to working with Meta is only one part of the miracles that had to occur for this future to pan out.

"The people who ousted me, who orchestrated my destruction, who seized my baby from me, are not even at Meta anymore," Luckey said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.threads.com/@heaney_555/post/DKQdTFjIjkJ?xmt=AQF0wNqNu-DcDWwbIguM5jRl-jUm5LmpJlq0E3J0JXF-Ew">in an interview</a> last month.</p><p>This made it possible for Luckey and Zuckerberg to form a new partnership that would benefit both of them, helping to bridge the gap between AR and VR technologies that Luckey had created with those that Meta has funded since he departed from the company nearly a decade ago.</p><p>Better yet, Luckey notes that these new headsets <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/gVXPERyRjOA?si=01TngSzb6cwai09E&t=3015">will be entirely made in America</a>, yet another miracle that seemed impossible in an electronics industry almost entirely dependent on China.</p><div><blockquote><p>Palmer Luckey's return to Meta's good graces ensures something huge is on the horizon.</p></blockquote></div><p>In fact, the partnership appears to encompass all of Meta's Reality Labs experiments, including Meta AI and its associated components.  "The collaboration builds on Meta's existing Reality Labs investments and its work supporting adoption of its Llama open source AI models for national security uses by the U.S. and its closest allies."</p><p>Once the assembly lines are built and resources are in place, it's a clear road to the affordable, American-made smart glasses that were once a part of science fiction. It could even be the path to something far greater than smart glasses, if all the right resources are in place to move more manufacturing to the U.S.</p><p>At the very least, it's the path that Zuckerberg can use to claim he's been right all along, amidst the visionless stock market investors who have complained their way through the last decade of Reality Labs' spending.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It doesn't reveal any specifics of the handsets, but there is emphasis on a new Ultra foldable model incoming. Meanwhile, new information reveals what to expect from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>.</p><p>Prominent analyst Ross Young on X (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-z-fold-7-screen-sizes-confirmed-report/">SamMobile</a>) has shared the screen sizes of the Galaxy Z Fold 7, including the external and internal foldable display. The latter seems to be a notable upgrade over the predecessor as it is tipped to be having an 8-inch screen. The Galaxy Z Fold 6 had a 7.6-inch screen in comparison.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Confirmed at 8.00” and 6.49”…Same as Z Fold 6 SE…<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1930492026468073917">June 5, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>According to Young, the cover screen will also be seeing a sizable upgrade as it is expected to measure 6.49 inches, which is a step up from 6.3 inches from the previous iteration. It also means that the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">flagship foldable</a> will likely be identical to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-special-edition-announced">Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition</a>, which was announced back in October and confined to the Chinese market.</p><p>It came in as a surprise launch from the company last year, and alongside the bigger screens, the Special Edition was also lighter than the Galaxy Z Fold 6 — it was 1.5mm thinner and three grams lighter. Going by the latest information from Young, it appears Samsung is likely sticking to the design aesthetics of the Special Edition for the upcoming Galaxy Z Fold 7.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:960px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:60.10%;"><img id="gUnm8fpf7MSkase53rkqEh" name="Samsung-galaxy-z-fold-ultra" alt="Samsung teases a Z Fold Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gUnm8fpf7MSkase53rkqEh.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="960" height="577" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>SamMobile further notes that despite the bigger screens, the next foldable from Samsung will still be sticking to the 4400mAh battery capacity as the Z Fold 6.

While some folks will be unhappy with the curved glass, it makes for a gorgeous phone that, when combined with the vegan leather back, makes it hard not to admire it constantly throughout the day.</p><p>It's also quite thin and light feeling thanks to the tapered edges, and the choice of PANTONE Forest Green is simply stunning. It's hard to find a better looking phone than this, even if it means finding a good tempered glass protector will be tough.</p><p>On top of being thin and light, this is one of the elite phones to feature an IP68/IP69 water and dust resistance rating, meaning it can take a real beating, be put in the dishwasher, and still come out running like a champ. It's also got a giant 5,200mAh battery inside that gives this stellar battery life, and 68W charging ensures you only need a few minutes to top the phone up before heading out the door.</p><div

It's not a bad processor, but it doesn't belong in a $550 phone. Period. Motorola sells the international model of this phone under the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-edge-60-fusion-announced">Motorola Edge 60 Fusion</a> name, and it's roughly 30% cheaper than the Motorola Edge 2025.</p><p>As I've used this phone over the past week, I've encountered numerous performance issues, including hitches, lags, and stutters. These are not present in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">Google Pixel 9a</a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a>, both of which are in the same price range.</p><p>Turning off the silly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ram-boost-explained">RAM Boost feature</a> helped performance for me, but it didn't erase the lags and stutters completely. This processor is also not performant enough to even run Minecraft's Vibrant Visuals setting at a playable frame rate. It's really a shame because, while this processor is marginally faster than last year's Edge 2024 processor, it pales in comparison to other phones at this price range.</p><div><blockquote><p>While most elements of the phone are excellent, the slow processors holds the entire experience back.</p></blockquote></div><p>While Motorola says the display is better than last year's, my own tests tell me otherwise. The small bump in resolution isn't worth the tradeoff in refresh rate, and this display has mura issues in addition to using color dithering to fake deeper colors than the panel can actually produce. Motorola still ships it with the excellent full DC dimming mode that I lauded the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-2023-review">Motorola Edge Plus 2023</a> for, but the aggressive dithering means this isn't a great display for sensitive eyes.</p><p>The Motorola Edge 2025 is only slated for two OS upgrades and three years of bi-monthly security updates. By comparison, Google and Samsung offer seven years of both at this price range, and companies like OnePlus offer five years, further reducing the value of this phone.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-motorola-edge-2025-competition"><span>Motorola Edge 2025: Competition</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="h89PYP9Hr4tnMLVQUwC8Wo" name="OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13R review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h89PYP9Hr4tnMLVQUwC8Wo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Motorola's biggest problem is that there is steep competition at this price point. If you're buying unlocked, your money is better spend on a Google Pixel 9a or a OnePlus 13R. My recommendation would be the OnePlus 13R for several reasons.</p><p>The OnePlus 13R features a substantially faster processor — nearly 200% faster, actually — plus four OS updates and six years of security updates. That's double what Motorola offers. It's not going to have quite as many AI features as Moto AI offers, but I don't think those things are device sellers, just fun stuff to have.</p><p>The Google Pixel 9a is a great second choice that comes in a little cheaper at $499. The Pixel 9a also delivers a faster processor than the Motorola Edge 2025, but not as fast as the OnePlus 13R's processor. It upgrades the software update policy to seven years of OS <em>and</em> security updates, though, so this is a phone that you can potentially hold on to for a long time.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-motorola-edge-2025-should-you-buy"><span>Motorola Edge 2025: Should you buy</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wA5y2ow7qmts2XPvdcgqiT" name="Motorola-Edge-2025-camera-01" alt="Taking a macro shot of red flowers with the Motorola Edge 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wA5y2ow7qmts2XPvdcgqiT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p><ul><li>You can get a great deal from a carrier.</li><li>You love Motorola's design, including the excellent vegan leather backs.</li><li>You want a phone with excellent battery life and fast charging.</li></ul><p><strong>You should not buy this if...</strong></p><ul><li>You get easily irritated by phones with slower processors.</li><li>You want to hold on to your phone for more than three years.</li><li>You hate curved screens.</li></ul><p>For the second year in a row, Motorola has made an excellent Edge phone that is simply too expensive for its own good.

You'll experience plenty of stutters and lags as you use the phone, and while turning off RAM Boost helps some, the experience is simply worse than other phones you can get for the same price. Plus, with only three years of updates, it's going to last half as long as a Pixel 9a or OnePlus 13R. Maybe next year, Motorola.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="5040cebf-1aac-40aa-b3a1-268774c62b1f">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:126.02%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DGhPrkEnRR8Aq4uDyGb6eX.jpg' alt="An official render of the Motorola Edge 2025 in PANTONE Forest Green"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Motorola Edge 2025</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The Motorola Edge 2025 has a gorgeous PANTONE-certified vegan leather back, IP68/IP69 ingress protection ratings, excellent battery life, quick charging, and Moto AI features you'll love.</p></p>                </div>                <div class="pro-con"></div>            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>My wife summed up the OnePlus 13s perfectly: "this just looks like a smaller iPhone, but with Android." That's basically what it is to use the OnePlus 13s; while it is good to see OnePlus making a compact device — the OnePlus X came out a decade ago — the 13s ends up deviating a bit too much from the manufacturer's design language.</p><p>Look, I get that most phones these days have a similar design, and I'm okay with that; switching to a flatter profile allows brands to slot in massive batteries, and that's undoubtedly a good thing. But with the 13s, it feels like OnePlus intentionally tried to make a device that's as close to the iPhone as possible, and it isn't just the hardware design — the changes to OxygenOS bring it closer to iOS.</p><p>I had the OnePlus 13s for over a month, and I used the device extensively in that time. This is what you need to know about OnePlus' compact flagship, and whether you should pick it up.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-13s-specs-price-and-global-availability"><span>OnePlus 13s: Specs, price, and global availability</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="LeWaEqBKVwUhoGaSAn5T93" name="OnePlus 13s" alt="OnePlus 13s review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LeWaEqBKVwUhoGaSAn5T93.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>OnePlus unveiled the 13s in India on June 5, and the phone is going on sale in the country in the coming weeks. The device is identical to the OnePlus 13T that debuted in China back in April, with two differences: the 13s has a smaller 5,850mAh battery (the 13T has 6,260mAh), and the 13s gets a 32MP selfie camera with autofocus.</p><p>The 13s is available in two configurations: the base model with 12GB/256GB storage is going on sale in India starting at ₹54,999 ($640), and there's also a 12GB/512GB model that costs ₹59,999 ($699). The device basically slots in between the OnePlus 13R and OnePlus 13, and it isn't quite as affordable as I thought it would be.</p><p>Why the name change to 13s, you ask? OnePlus says it did so to highlight the fact that this is a smaller phone. As to why it didn't do so in China, your guess is as good as mine. Although the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a> is available globally, OnePlus isn't selling the 13s outside India, and the 13T is exclusive to China.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>OnePlus 13s</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.32 -inch 120Hz LTPO AMOLED, 2640x1216, 1600 nits max</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>OxygenOS 15 based on Android 15</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Chipset</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite, Adreno 830, 3nm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>12GB LPDDR5X</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB/512GB UFS 4.0</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear camera 1</p></td><td  ><p>50MP Sony Lytia LYT-700, PDAF, OIS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear camera 2</p></td><td  ><p>50MP Samsung JN5 tele, 2x optical zoom</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Front camera</p></td><td  ><p>32MP GalaxyCore GC32, autofocus, 4K video</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ingress protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP65 dust and water resistance</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6.0, limited 5G bands, NFC, dual-band GPS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Security</p></td><td  ><p>Optical in-screen sensor</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Audio</p></td><td  ><p>USB-C, stereo sound, AptX HD, LDAC, LHDC 5.0 </p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>5,850mAh battery, 80W charging</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>150.8 x 71.7 x 8.2mm, 185g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Green, Pink, Black</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-13s-design"><span>OnePlus 13s: Design</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5050px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.34%;"><img id="oyLyqYW39pBzTkzpvZpRz" name="OnePlus 13s" alt="OnePlus 13s review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oyLyqYW39pBzTkzpvZpRz.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5050" height="2845" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>The OnePlus 13s has a compact design with a good in-hand feel. </strong></li><li><strong>However, the design closely resembles that of an iPhone. </strong></li><li><strong>The phone is limited to IP65 water resistance, and the optical fingerprint sensor isn't in an ideal location. </strong></li></ul><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Roundups</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-small-android-phone"><strong>Best compact phones<br></strong></a><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones"><strong>Best affordable phones</strong></a><strong><br>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones"><strong>Best OnePlus phones</strong></a></p></div></div><p>OnePlus says the 13s has a "stunning new design," but what it actually looks like is an iPhone.

OnePlus made several changes to the software this year, and the design brings it closer to iOS. A new addition is AI Plus Mind, a feature that collates photos, notes, and other data in a single location. If you have any information you'd like to save — bills, event QR codes, and so on — just press and hold the Plus Key, and it gets saved to Mind Space.</p><p>The utility uses machine learning to extract relevant information. If that sounds familiar, it's because Nothing's Essential Space basically does the same thing, and if anything, Google's Pixel Screenshots has a similar utility. I'll admit that it is useful in certain scenarios, but as of now, it doesn't do much other than summarizing information.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="Bq8UuJomJEBE2pqYV9y5G3" name="OnePlus 13s" alt="OnePlus 13s review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Bq8UuJomJEBE2pqYV9y5G3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You can't take your data out either, so it is tied to the device. As it stands, there isn't much to justify the feature, but it's clear that the manufacturer sees AI as a point of differentiation (like every other phone brand), so it should get better features in the coming months.</p><p>Most of the time, using the software on the 13s was an exercise in frustration. I migrated data from the Vivo X200 Pro, but it didn't install everything — basic apps like Amazon and Swiggy didn't show up, and I had to go to the Play Store and download these again. This is never an issue on other devices, but I ran into the same problem on the OnePlus 13 earlier this year, so I'm highlighting it.</p><p>Background memory management continues to be very aggressive, so if you have an app in the background, it will be shut down after a few hours. There is intermittent lag when browsing in Chrome, and it could just be a case of the device not being optimized ahead of launch, as I didn't see this issue on the regular model.</p><p>And then there's the usual AI-backed features. You get AI Search and AI transcribing along with translation, and they do a decent enough job. There's a new AI Call Assistant, and it is meant to provide real-time translation. I tested it with Hindi to English, and it just didn't do a good enough job translating the call on the fly; the resultant text was wrong in many areas, and it wasn't able to handle entire sentences.</p><p>Coming to updates, the 13s will get the standard four years of Android updates alongside six years of security patches.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-13s-the-alternatives"><span>OnePlus 13s: The alternatives</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="z8HbCAz4dXgnQR3uQFhnma" name="iqoo-13-16.jpg" alt="iQOO 13 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/z8HbCAz4dXgnQR3uQFhnma.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I like the OnePlus 13R, and although it isn't as fast as the 13s, you won't notice any difference in daily use, and it has a bigger AMOLED panel and larger battery.

You get standout battery life, and the main camera takes good photos and videos.</p><p>That said, I'm not a fan of the design or the software. OxygenOS 15 is now veering so close to iOS that it just doesn't have any originality left, and there are enough annoyances with bugs that it wasn't enjoyable to use the phone. I'm sure these will be resolved a few weeks after the phone goes on sale — that's always been the case in the last three years — but I don't see why these couldn't be addressed beforehand, like every other phone manufacturer is able to do.</p><p>Most of the time, I felt like I was beta testing the 13s. The OnePlus 13 continues to be an outlier in that it didn't have any of these issues out of the box, and with the 13s, OnePlus is back to its usual shenanigans of launching a phone before it's ready. If you're willing to wait a few weeks (or even months), then the 13s has the potential to be a decent enough choice in this category. But as it stands, it just doesn't measure up.</p> ]]></dc:content>

OK, there are really only like seven, but it can seem like a million if you don't know what you're looking at.</p><p>First, you need to know that Chrome is Google's branding for anything and everything built from a specific code base. This code is openly available and free, so plenty of companies use it or parts of it in their own products. Microsoft Edge, Brave, Opera, and many other web browsers are based on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/no-chromium-browsers-arent-going-anywhere-any-time-soon">Chromium code</a>; however, Google doesn't control these programs or their branding.</p><p>Yes, Chrome is a brand, and Google does a lot to make sure it's a recognizable one.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wNiJg57PLFagd7kuHJFHoa" name="chrome-generative-ai-gemini-update.jpg" alt="Chrome gets a new generative AI update with Google Gemini" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wNiJg57PLFagd7kuHJFHoa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You also need to differentiate Chrome a little bit. Not from other software, but from itself. You have three "major" flavors of Chrome:</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/after-using-chrome-os-four-months-i-never-want-go-back"><strong>Chrome OS</strong></a> is an operating system built by Google and used to power lightweight laptops and mini-PC desktops. It's further split out into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chrome-os-flex">Chrome OS Flex</a>, a version for devices that are a little older and no longer supported through the same channels, and unstable testing versions designed for developers.</p><p><strong>The </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chrome-for-android-is-getting-extensions-but-not-like-youd-expect"><strong>Chrome Browser</strong></a><strong> for mobile</strong> is a version of Chrome that will run on your smartphone. It's built for both Android and iOS from mostly the same code and is an officially licensed Google product. It's further split into a Stable, Extended Stable, Beta, Developer, and Canary version for different levels of feature testing. <strong>Right up front</strong>: if you find an article like this helpful, forget all about the Dev and Canary versions. They're usually pretty broken and <em>really</em> only for people who love to test stuff.</p><p><strong>The </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chrome-96-stable-rolling-out"><strong>Chrome Browser</strong></a><strong> for desktops</strong> is the last version you'll encounter. It's the same as the mobile version, only built for desktop computer operating systems like Windows, macOS, or Linux-based systems. It uses most of the same code base but offers a few more features that aren't in the mobile versions, most notably <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chrome-for-android-is-getting-extensions-but-not-like-youd-expect">extensions</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yW898rfyAU8H93z54gtmpN" name="google-chrome-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Google Chrome lifestyle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yW898rfyAU8H93z54gtmpN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Chris Wedel / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Confused yet? Don't be. All these bits of software could have individual names and be a little less confusing, but Google puts them all under the Chrome brand to strengthen it. The more products with a Chrome label and a good bit of interoperability because of the shared code, the stronger the recognition and development community will be.</p><p>You probably don't need to worry about browser rendering tests or any sort of web development, so that cuts things down a bit. You also won't need to understand the Extended Stable branch unless you're a corporate developer, so you can safely forget about it, too.</p><p>That makes things a lot easier.</p><h2 id="which-should-you-choose-2">Which should you choose?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1024px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yGkWXEEK3QACexpixsxsa8" name="Chrome-Logo" alt="The Chrome logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yGkWXEEK3QACexpixsxsa8.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1024" height="576" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The first thing to consider is whether you should use Chrome at all. Most people do, and if you have an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a>, it's there whether you like it or not, but there are plenty of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-browsers">other web browsers</a> for you to choose from. Some aren't as good, some are a little better, and they all offer a distinct feature or two. Spend some time checking a few out if you're curious, and you might like one enough to keep it around.</p><p>Second, if you're talking <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebook</a>, you don't really have a choice. A Chromebook (or a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebox" target="_blank">Chromebox</a>) comes from the manufacturer with the correct version of Chrome OS installed, and until it's no longer supported, you can only choose to run the stable version or a non-stable testing version. Avoid selecting one of those for a Chromebook you use daily. Keep things that are designed to be simple, well, simple.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1384px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="K8Ac4X4cRe3hvcrhdfULb" name="mobile browsers-2.jpg" alt="Mobile web browser apps on Android" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/K8Ac4X4cRe3hvcrhdfULb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1384" height="779" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On your phone, things can get a little weird. I'm going to tell you that if you're reading an article like this one and want to know a bit more about all this, stick with the stable version that is already installed on your Android phone. If you have an iPhone, just use Safari unless you have a specific reason not to. Again — keep it simple.</p><p>You'll see other articles or social media posts about all the cool things you could do with an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-change-your-software-channel-chrome-os">unstable version of the Chrome Browser</a>. While tempting, remember that any of those that actually work as intended will make it into the stable branch of Chrome you're using.</p><p>These unstable versions are there to test changes at different levels of completeness — Canary is going to be brand new and busted, Dev might work enough to start testing how your development projects work with it, and Beta is there once someone at Google decides new code works well enough for a more general test with a few million users.</p><h2 id="don-t-rock-the-boat-unless-you-want-to-2">Don't rock the boat. Unless you want to.</h2><p>Really, this is a good way to test things. If I were a backend web developer, for my job, I wouldn't care how my software works with Chrome Canary or Chrome OS Canary. I would want to check out the latest Dev version to see if I'll need to make any changes, and for everyday use, I would run the Beta channel.</p><p>I'm not a web developer; I'm a guy who bangs on a keyboard for a living. I stick with stable Chrome all around. I don't want broken features causing me problems, and since I need to use Chrome for work, I stick to the latest release version. For goofing around, I use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/latest-mozilla-firefox-update-so-important-even-department-homeland-security-says-you-should-upgrade">Firefox</a> on both my phone and my desktop computer for everything but online shopping. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/i-dont-know-what-id-do-without-chromes-autofill-feature">Google's tools to securely store payment options</a> are pretty great.</p><p>Only you know what your tolerance for broken stuff will be. The way to stay away from it (mostly, all software is buggy sometimes) is to forget all about it and stick with the stable version.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Something substantial was supposedly discovered in the Google Translate app's latest version, which concerns its results page. The tipster's evidence shows Google is preparing a "list of possible translations," as well as the most plausible/closest one.</p><p>The latter is featured at the top in larger text, accompanied by the definition and uses of the word.</p><p>However, beneath that, outlined in a thin border, is Google's planned "More translations" box. It's there that users could see other ways a word in English or another language could be translated for whatever you've chosen. Google will state whether these translations are adjectives or otherwise, alongside how they can be used in a sentence.</p><p>The tipster also discovered the ability to "expand" on these other translations. Selecting one of these alternate translations places it front and center (or front and higher?) on the UI, right below the word you wanted translated. The post states that two new options were found: "Regional Variants" and "Ask a question."</p><h2 id="google-s-fresh-future-2">Google's fresh future</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:266px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:225.56%;"><img id="5rgfDsAkSbA7xcu8AJfU3d" name="google-translate-revamped-more-translations-look" alt="A snapshot of Google Translate's potential redesign, which places your initial word large at the top with the translation under that and "more translations" further down." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5rgfDsAkSbA7xcu8AJfU3d.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="266" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:270px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:222.22%;"><img id="zXamq3irbi4byjwKxGGw3d" name="google-translate-revamped-insights-button-leak" alt="Google Translate's code suggests it could have an "Insights" button on the way, which shows how to use the word in that other language." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zXamq3irbi4byjwKxGGw3d.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="270" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The former gives some lengthy text about the word's usage in the country and its "core meaning," if available.

Lastly, the tipster highlights an "Insights" button, which sort of guides users through the word and how it can be used properly in that language.</p><p>As always, with early glimpses like this, it's not extremely clear when we could see this arrive. The update seems mostly fleshed out, but we'll just have to be patient for now.</p><p>Ever since Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-i-o-2025-the-biggest-announcements-from-ai-to-android-xr">wrapped up I/O 2025</a>, the company's been busy reworking and retooling its app ecosystem for its future.

The company stated during the event that it was going to plug in Gemini 2.5 into AI Mode and AI Overviews to better aid user queries. The upgraded model should help deliver results that fit exactly what users are looking for, and without the lengthy reading many searches might require.</p> ]]></dc:content>

According to the post, speculation says the Galaxy Z Flip 7 will see a 256GB and a 512GB storage option. The leak touches on the possibility of a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE</a>, as well, stating a slightly smaller selection: 128GB and 256GB.</p><p>Colors are the other side of these leaks, but the publication only highlights the expected flagship Flip 7. Its information suggests the device will debut in a Coral Red, black, and blue option.</p><p>Elsewhere, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is supposedly launching with a blue option called "Blue Shadow." This is rumored to be joined by a black and silver color choice.</p><h2 id="the-next-watch-2">The Next Watch</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="tJcLE9Td92zZ82wCWF3q45" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-6-Classic-01.jpg" alt="One of the new watch faces on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tJcLE9Td92zZ82wCWF3q45.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The publication's sources also provided some alleged Galaxy Watch 8 Classic details, which claim it will arrive in a black and white option. The wearable leaks differ here, as the post states the regular Galaxy Watch 8 could see a 40mm and a 44mm size for interested consumers. Strangely, the rumors only mention one color option, Graphite (likely a silver tone), for these two size variants.</p><p>Leaks about Samsung's foldables and upcoming watches have cropped up more consistently recently, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/new-leak-suggests-samsungs-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-galaxy-z-flip-7-wont-see-a-price-hike">speculation about the former's pricing</a>. Supposedly, Samsung's next foldables might not increase prices in "most regions," and remain at $1,099 for the Flip 7 and $1,899 for the Fold 7. However, as the threat of more substantial tariffs intensifies in the U.S., there's a chance consumers could see a ~30% or 40% price hike.</p><p>In other news, the Galaxy Watch 8 series caught a few eyes as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/galaxy-watch-8-series-imagery-squircle-quick-button-leaks">some alleged imagery</a> suggests it could rock a squricle (square, circle fusion) design. If true, this would bring the next series closer to Samsung's previous <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy Watch Ultra. </a>The Watch 8 Classic is also rumored to have a third physical button on the way, dubbed the "Quick" button. Again, this is another instance in which the Classic could become more Ultra.</p><p>We don't have much longer to wait until we see what's really what. We're expecting Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-summer-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">summer Galaxy Unpacked</a> to kick off this summer, potentially in July.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p> ]]></dc:content>

It's your tool, so it should work for you. Of course, I mean that for everyone; a phone is a tool, but it's also a very personal belonging and deeply integrated into modern life. Each of us should have choices on how we want to use it.</p><p>That choice is slowly being taken away, and faceless corporations are deciding more and more what we <del>want</del> get. The best example of all this is AI. Whether you like it or not, want to use it or not, it will be there. It will only get worse from here.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Ekn2mwwza3B283LYzRd7n6" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-ui-8-beta-1-galaxy-ai" alt="The Galaxy AI welcome screen on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra running One UI 8" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ekn2mwwza3B283LYzRd7n6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Case in point — Samsung, like Motorola, looks to be working on deeply integrating <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-explores-perplexity-ai-integration-to-rival-gemini-on-galaxy-s26-series">Perplexity AI into its Galaxy smartphones</a>. I'm going to be upfront — I do not trust Perplexity as a company. I'm not claiming there's anything malicious going on, but the company's track record simply gives me no reason to trust them.</p><p>I really don't trust Google, Samsung, Apple, or anyone else either, not when it comes to the ability to do anything with my phone. Once something is deeply integrated into the OS, such as an AI agent from the factory, all bets are off. You probably can't tell exactly what it's capable of and must blindly trust people who aim to make a lot of money from you. This has to stop.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZTAXJrXYyGc5xvf7Ecsvji" name="google-io-ai-google-gemini-action-intelligence" alt="Gemini Action Intelligence at Google I/O 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZTAXJrXYyGc5xvf7Ecsvji.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I want to be clear about what I'm talking about. Phone makers use AI to do everything nowadays. AI tries to optimize your network connections, creates a photo when you press the camera button, and it's part of what tells your phone to stop charging before it blows up. I am not referring to this type of AI, although there may be a more effective, albeit more expensive, way to handle these tasks.</p><p>I'm talking about AI like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-unveiled">Google Gemini</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/bixby">Bixby</a>, or now <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/perplexity-ai-motorola-samsung-agreement-discussions-reported">Perplexity</a>. AI gets in your face if you let it, but it is always there to do things someone else decided you wanted it to do. When software like that gets a set of elevated permissions (meaning it can do <em>more</em> with the system and data than even you can), it needs to be because we asked for it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1420px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="p2mDbY2B8NDmcTp5RaTK8k" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-7-alleged-renders" alt="Camera design update on Galaxy Z Flip 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p2mDbY2B8NDmcTp5RaTK8k.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1420" height="799" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Render of what the Galaxy Z Flip 7 may look like. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I wasn't planning on buying a new Galaxy phone this year, but it's one I will often recommend. I think <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Samsung makes good products</a>. If I were thinking of buying one, seeing a third party in the mix in ways that could be too invasive, I'd probably decline. I'm not pointing my finger at Samsung alone — I'm also wary of buying a new Razr or a Pixel due to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/the-motorola-razr-and-perplexity-are-trying-to-change-how-you-use-your-phone">invasive AI that has been built into the system</a>.</p><p>I imagine there's a way to remove it if you're willing to do the work. Android isn't open like it used to be, but smart people have figured out how to keep doing smart things. I'm not going to worry about removing it. Instead, I'll just not buy into it, at least until I can have a little more faith in it.</p><p>The best option would be to let me buy a phone without all of it there in the first place. I should be the one to decide who has any control over my digital life, no matter how insignificant it may be. This won't happen, and eventually, I will relent or I'll be left behind; this is the future, whether anyone likes it or not.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Speaking about how the Korean OEM designed this 5.8mm thin device, Gaiser said that "We really designed this from the ground up to be thin. The goal was to be thin without compromise." The company didn't want to take away features while chasing to create a slim phone, he added.</p><p>Samsung had to make a device that was durable, despite being extremely thin, by utilizing a titanium frame and Corning's Ceramic 2. "So that way, we're able to utilize every single component as efficiently and effectively as possible and making sure that how we put it together gives you a really good balance in the hand," Gaiser says.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CoozfCZjnHhMrYZN66rw4Z" name="Galaxy-S25-Edge-Silver-Back-Camera-Lenses-10" alt="Dual cameras on the Galaxy S25 Edge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CoozfCZjnHhMrYZN66rw4Z.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While Gaiser said they didn't want to compromise on anything while creating this phone, in reality, they did give the phone a smaller battery capacity when compared to the rest of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-launch">Galaxy S25 series </a>lineup.</p><p>Battery capacity is a top priority for anyone buying a new phone, and Gaiser says, despite the 3,900 mAh capacity, the phone doesn't drain out by lunch, and it lasts people an entire day. "It has worked as well or better than the S24 base model and very close to the S25 base model," he added.</p><p>Speaking about the device's camera, since it lacks a telephoto lens with a 3x zoom, Gaiser says that the phone makes up for it with the latest camera tech as well as agentic AI. "From the chipset up, utilizing cognitive-aware engines so that your camera understands what you're taking photos of and is able to utilize AI to give you that perfect shot."</p><p>He also added that they've taken in account the most popular zooms that people use on the daily, and found out that users only end up using "the 0.6X to get those really wide macro views, the 1X, 2X and 3X," he added.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9LsA2guYNRTpYU3bdU4tci" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-colors-24" alt="Holding the Galaxy S25 Edge in all three colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9LsA2guYNRTpYU3bdU4tci.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While the phone does have its own set of trade-offs, AC's contributor Nirave Gondhia says that these can actually be overlooked once you physically hold the device.

Rolling out today (June 4), Glance states Galaxy users will soon be able to "visualize themselves" in different styles and places.</p><p>Samsung's head and senior director of Galaxy Store in the U.S., Jason Shim, says, "By using AI to personalize content and shopping directly on the lock screen, it brings a smarter, more dynamic experience that reflects the forward-thinking spirit of the Galaxy Store."</p><p>Glance adds that this new experience is tailor-made for Galaxy users; however, it still leverages Google's Gemini and Imagen models. This "opt-in" experience will train its shopping capabilities using the selfies (or images) you provide. Glance says its software will create "hyper-real images of consumers" in outfits it believes you'd look the best in. When used from your Galaxy S25 Ultra's lock screen, Glance states users can easily access its app's features while also saving the look as a new wallpaper or shareable photo.</p><p>The outfits Glance AI pulls from include over 400 of its partnered brands and retailers across the U.S. and abroad. Purchasing the outfits you see remains easy, as well, with just a tap whenever something piques your interest.</p><p>Glance and Samsung's partnership will bring this new shopping app and lock screen experience to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">the Galaxy S25 series</a> (excluding the Edge), the S22 series, the S23 series, and the S24 series (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-hands-on">the S24 FE</a>, too).</p><h2 id="2"></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:300px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:200.00%;"><img id="HTprMKVMfLWuEV6fao3hbk" name="Glance-AI-app-01" alt="Glance AI app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HTprMKVMfLWuEV6fao3hbk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="300" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Glance)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In case you're wondering, Glance says its AI software is conscious of ongoing trends, "local events," social media content, and more. Additionally, Glance's shopping AI and lock screen experience will also inform users of sales, just in case you really want that outfit.</p><p>As previously stated, the Glance AI shopping app and lock screen experience are rolling out for those Galaxy devices today (June 4), available in the Galaxy Store.</p><p>In May, Glance <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/glance-ai-allows-to-shop-fashion-via-personalized-ai-generated-lock-screen-visuals">revealed its new generative AI-backed</a> shopping experience for phones and their lock screens. One of the differences Glances says it upholds is that it puts the user front and center with a curated set of outfits and styles. This all leverages the selfie you provide, as well as additional information, such as your age, body type, gender, and hit generate.</p><p>Glance's partnered brands include Levi’s, Old Navy, and Tommy Hilfiger.</p><p>It's also worth noting that this Google-supported company is interested in pursuing more AI styling assistance for beauty, accessories, and travel. This is all part of its plans for "later this year," so keep your eyes open.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>
