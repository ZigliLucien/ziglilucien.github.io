                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I've reviewed dozens of running watches, and several of my favorites are now affordable thanks to Cyber Monday. But I'm reevaluating one watch I reviewed, the Amazfit Cheetah Pro, now that it's fallen to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-cheetah-pro-review"><strong>$179 (40% off) for Cyber Monday</strong></a>, a much more reasonable price for what it offers.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-cheetah-pro-review">Amazfit Cheetah Pro</a> hardware is (mostly) solid: the 1.45-inch AMOLED display, week-long battery life with heavy use, titanium bezel, mic/speaker for Bluetooth calls, dual-band GPS and altimeter for accurate location and elevation, and a lightweight 43g (with strap) frame all make for a compelling package!</p><p>The display could be brighter, the speaker louder, and the GPS and HR data slightly more accurate to match Garmin's. But the training software itself is solid: it gave me reliable post-run recovery time estimates and realistic training load numbers after my test workouts. My complaints are much easier to stomach at this price point, and anyone worried about optical HR accuracy can always connect an external HRM.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You don't want to pay for a fitness subscription for Zepp Coach AI insights, you need Bluetooth calling and voice commands on a non-smart watch, and you need guidance on what kind of workout to do to improve as a runner.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You can accept a cheaper-looking Garmin watch with no titanium bezel or downloadable local maps, but which will beat the Cheetah Pro for battery life and GPS accuracy while at least matching it for workout suggestions and training load insights.</p>
<p>I prefer Garmin watches, but only the $599 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Forerunner 965</a> (currently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Forerunner%C2%AE-Smartwatch-Colorful-Training/dp/B0BS1TP8TJ"><strong>$499 for Cyber Monday</strong></a>) has a titanium bezel and topographic maps, and you'd need a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review">Venu 3</a> (which doesn't have specialized running tools) for a mic & speaker. So, in theory, the Cheetah Pro was already a bargain at $299 and is now a steal at $179.</p><p>If you're more interested in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/early-black-friday-garmin-deals-2024-ditch-your-old-smartwatch-and-save-big-on-forerunner-venu-and-more">Garmin Cyber Monday deal</a> on a running watch, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-165-review">Garmin Forerunner 165</a> is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Forerunner-Smartwatch-Colorful-Training/dp/B0CT3VBDTV"><strong>$199 ($50 off)</strong></a>, making it only slightly more expensive than a Cheetah Pro. It has a smaller display, cheaper-looking design, only breadcrumb navigation, and no training load — but makes up for it with daily suggested workouts, recovery time, and better HR/ GPS accuracy. Still, you can see how Amazfit's ultra-discounted Cheetah Pro is a compelling alternative now!</p><p>You can also look into a proper smartwatch like the Pixel Watch 3 45mm LTE (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Watch-Latest-Model/dp/B0D91424WX"><strong>$170 off for Cyber Monday</strong></a>), which has much better Bluetooth calling, commands, Cardio Load, and AI smarts for workouts through Fitbit. But most runners would prefer the Cheetah Pro's 7-day battery life to the Watch 3's 2-day battery!</p><p>Even though I find the Zepp app and Cheetah Pro software a bit less polished than other brands, and I really wish its display got brighter in direct sunlight, the Amazfit Cheetah Pro is an all-around winner at this Cyber Monday price.</p>

<ul><li>Realme's next flagship could pack an extra-large battery ranging from 7,000mAh to 8,000mAh.</li><li>The current Realme GT 7 Pro features a 6,500mAh battery that's already much larger than most flagships, but Realme is shooting for an even bigger one next year.</li><li>According to leaker Digital Chat Station, there are three potential battery configurations being tested for Realme's next phone.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Realme might not be a household name in the US, but the brand is known for making Android smartphones with high-capacity batteries inside. The latest Realme GT 7 Pro packs a 6,500mAh battery inside, and even the sub-$400 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/realme-12-pro-plus-5g-review">Realme 12 Pro Plus 5G</a> includes a respectable 5,000mAh capacity. The phones charge fast, too, at 120W and 67W, respectively. As it turns out, Realme may be looking to improve on its own incredible high-capacity, fast-charging tech with its next flagship.</p><p>The company is reportedly testing three new variations of batteries, all with a larger capacity than the GT 7 Pro, according to leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5106069766930600" target="_blank">Digital Chat Station on Weibo</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/realme-8000-mah-phone-3504525/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>). Per the tip, these are the characteristics of the three batteries being tested for Realme's upcoming flagship phone:</p>
<ul><li>A 7,000mAh battery supporting 120W fast charging that can be charged to full in 42 minutes</li><li>A 7,500mAh battery supporting 100W fast charging that can be charged to full in 55 minutes</li><li>An 8,000mAh battery supporting 80W fast charging that can be charged to full in 70 minutes</li></ul>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7x5JVeAezUcHuS4LADBVGA" name="Realme-GT-6-review-18.jpg" alt="Realme GT 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7x5JVeAezUcHuS4LADBVGA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Roydon Cerejo/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Realme has a few decisions to make for the battery that will power an upcoming flagship, which Digital Chat Station didn't name specifically. It could be the Realme GT 8 Pro, and the phone could debut in 2025. However, as the leaked configurations show, the company will almost certainly be choosing between capacity and charge speed.</p><p>Evidently, the 8,000mAh battery rumored to be in consideration for a to-be-released Realme flagship has slow charging, relatively speaking. It can only charge at 80W speeds, resulting in a 70-minute charge time from 0% to 100%. That might not be such a bad thing, though. There could be less of a need to charge to full with a phone sporting an 8,000mAh capacity, with an overnight charge doing the trick for a day-plus of use.</p><p>When you compare the worst charging speeds of Realme's purported battery options (80W, 70 min), they stack up quite nicely to the leading iPhone and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung Galaxy phones</a>, which still have atrocious charging speeds. It's clear that Realme would be padding its own lead in battery and charging tech if it released a smartphone with either 7,000mAh, 7,500 mAh, or 8,000mAh battery capacities.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you have an Android phone, foldable, or tablet you want to use like a console; you care about things like having a D-pad that can be pressed in eight different places, or microswitch buttons; you value ergonomics.</p><p><br><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you need an ultra-portable game controller; you want a controller that supports haptic feedback on iOS and iPadOS; you don't want to spend more than $100.</p>
<p>The Razer Kishi Ultra might be the best controller you've ever used, not just the best <em>mobile</em> controller. This accessory features Razer's proprietary Mecha-tactile switches, which are tactile, clicky, and responsive, just like the ones you'd find on a high-end mechanical keyboard. While the joysticks aren't Hall effect, they are high-quality and come with sensitivity adjustment options in software. Speaking of software, the Razer Nexus app lets you tweak button mapping, change the controller's Razer Chroma RGB coloring, and use Razer Sensa HD Haptic feedback.</p><p>It's also the most versatile mobile game controller, supporting most Android devices running Android 12 or newer. The Razer Kishi Ultra also works with iOS 17 and iPadOS 17 devices, albeit without haptic support. With the a cable, you can use the Kishi Ultra with a gaming PC or laptop, too.</p><p>I'm a big fan of the Xbox Wireless Controller, and the Razer Kishi Ultra feels like that controller — but better, with mechanical switches. On top of that, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>, foldables, and small tablets can fit inside. If you want your phone to become a mobile gaming powerhouse, the Kishi Ultra is the accessory to buy, but you'll want to do so while it's discounted by $20 for Cyber Monday.</p>

<p>For anyone with a desk job, there's nothing more annoying than being reminded every hour how sedentary you're being. Apple and Galaxy Watches have Stand rings, while Fitbits or Pixel Watches tell you to walk 250 steps per hour. But most people I've asked say they turn off those reminders immediately.</p><p>Your first December pledge is simple: Turn those move alerts (back) on for the month. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/stand-alerts-will-save-your-life-but-most-watch-brands-get-them-wrong">Sitting all day is extremely unhealthy</a>; that article links to several studies showing that sitting 8 hours <u>actively undoes the health benefits</u> of an hour-long workout the same day. So if you want to start working out to lose weight, you also need to stay active <em>outside</em> of workouts.</p><p>Taking just 1–2 minutes every hour to walk around your cube farm or do squats by your desk won't specifically lose weight — you need a sustained walk to actively burn calories — but I guarantee that staying limber will help prevent you from putting on <em>more</em> weight and get you ready for workouts later.</p><p>I specifically recommend a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-charge-6-review">Fitbit Charge 6</a> for move alerts, because they require you to move around for a specific 250-step goal, not just stand and wave your arms around. But an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-9-long-term-review">Apple Watch</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch</a>'s ring-closing goals are also great motivation.</p>

<p>Speaking of steps, I'm sure you've all heard the cliche about walking 10,000 steps a day, which began as a marketing gimmick. But even though that number is arbitrary, the need for steps isn't. The medical consensus is that 6,000 steps a day will actively improve your health, with younger people requiring a higher daily average.</p><p>When <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-walked-10000-steps-a-day-for-one-month">I walked 10,000 steps a day for a month</a>, I lost seven pounds and 2.4% body fat, lowered my resting heart rate and blood pressure, and improved my cardiovascular fitness. I admittedly ran as well during this month, but the extra walking was the cause; case in point, I <em>gained</em> weight throughout 2023 despite running about 40–50 miles per month, up until that point.</p><p>For the next year, I continued to walk more frequently each month, and it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/tech-and-apps-i-used-to-lose-30-pounds">helped me lose 30 pounds in 12 months</a> — weight that I've since kept off. Seriously, walking works. But it's also a subtle, long-term solution; don't expect it to have the same impact as some unhealthy crash diet.</p>

<p>It's harder to walk so much in winter when the days are short, so I'm not insisting you follow my lead exactly. Instead, look at your current average daily steps in your fitness app of choice, and pledge to add 2,000 steps, or 4,000 steps, or whatever number you can handle. Each extra mile will either counterbalance or subtract your weight gains from overeating, without being too difficult.</p><p>For me, it usually takes about 15 minutes to walk a mile, or 2,000 steps, at a brisk pace; I know in advance that 6,000 steps is about a 45-minute commitment. Figure out your average time, find a safe morning or evening walking route near home (or buy a treadmill), and commit to walking a mile+ more per day (as much as your schedule can handle) at least five days per week. Make it a group activity with family members, if you can.</p><p>Any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness smartwatch</a> should count steps more or less accurately, while a smart ring is accurate during walks but gives <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smart-rings-vs-smartwatches-step-counting-test">lots of false positives</a> while you're sitting and typing. I prefer a Garmin watch, not only because they're extremely accurate for step count, but because they have step incentives. Every month has a 10,000-step "Challenge" to hit 300,000 for the month, helping you track your progress; plus, there is a weekly steps leaderboard where you compete with other random Garmin users to get the most steps that week.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="M5Ert9szdXvsvLAd6CjAS3" name="Withings-Body-Smart-weight-test.jpeg" alt="A 15-pound scale sits on the Withings Body Smart.

<p>I'm not a dieting proponent. It's important to cut back on unhealthy foods and use portion control for your favorite snacks — like only one slice of pie at Thanksgiving — but everyone I know who counts calories tends to hyperfixate on feelings of hunger and devolve into binge-eating before too long.</p><p>That being said, calorie counting is the best way to determine if you're overeating and which foods are directly contributing to your weight gain. And I know other people who <strong>swear by</strong> apps like MyFitnessPal as a way to keep themselves honest and lose weight, so I'm including it here.</p><p>First, you need to figure out your body's basal metabolic rate (BMR), or the maintenance calories your body typically burns per day to sustain itself. You can use an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.calculator.net/calorie-calculator.html">online calculator</a>, or buy a smart scale like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/withings-body-smart-review">Withings Body Scale</a> that auto-calculates it based on every weigh-in.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="dRva4c5ZTMWcfRaRNC2J9K" name="myfitnesspal-wear-os-screenshots" alt="Screenshots of the MyFitnessPal Wear OS app, including protein/ fat summaries and adding calories to your daily total" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dRva4c5ZTMWcfRaRNC2J9K.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Logging and tracking calories in the MyFitnessPal Wear OS app </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: MyFitnessPal)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Once you know your baseline, your caloric goal is simple: If you cut your intake by 3,500 calories, you'll lose a pound. So you need to either decrease what you eat below your daily BMR to slowly add up the deficit to 3,500, or <em>increase</em> your daily maximum by working out (or walking).</p><p>Someone with a 2,000-calorie BMR can <em>try</em> eating 1,500 calories every day — which would hypothetically add up to four pounds of weight loss in a month — but you need to be realistic about what your mind and body can handle over a sustained period, especially with so many tempting opportunities to overeat in December. So set yourself a reasonable goal to (at the very least) break even by reducing bad calories, and raise your threshold with workouts and walking.</p><p>Available on both Apple Watches and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.myfitnesspal.android&hl=en_US">MyFitnessPal</a> is the best smartwatch-based tool to keep track of this. It lets you log your most frequent meals, snacks, or drinks with a few taps, then see your daily carbs, fat, calories, or other bodily stats on a Tile view at any time, to make sure you're not overdoing it on sugar or slacking on your daily protein intake.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="LtZcjgFBNMX3NLL2Dho7gB" name="google-pixel-9-fitbit-app-recommended-for-today.jpg" alt="Pixel Watch 3 run coaching suggestion in the Fitbit app on a Pixel 9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LtZcjgFBNMX3NLL2Dho7gB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">An AI-generated Fitbit workout for the Pixel Watch 3 </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Walking is a safe, low-impact, and monotonous way to burn calories. If you want to really kick things into overdrive, you should start your couch-to-5K journey and start jogging more regularly. The problem is that most people who start running overdo it, hate the experience or injure themselves, and give up quickly.</p><p>That's why I recommend finding a watch that'll calculate your body's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-i-boosted-my-vo2-max-score-on-my-garmin-watch">VO2 Max</a>, or the ability to convert oxygen into energy effectively, and then give you recommendations for how much your body can work out on a given day.</p><p>More and more smartwatches now track your weekly or monthly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-training-load-focus-needs-one-obvious-fix">training load</a>, then tell you if you're improving or worsening your fitness, or if you're overtraining. Apple, Pixel, Garmin, and even Amazfit have differing tools for judging when your HR rises above resting, creating a TL score based on how high and for how long, then judging how your TL effort compares to past days and weeks.</p><p>On top of that, some watches like the Pixel Watch 3 or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-165-review">Garmin Forerunner 165</a> will use your training load data to generate automatic, daily run suggestions. Garmin gives you a specialized workout based on whether you need more low-HR or high-HR activities, with a specific time and pace. Fitbit generates a few different types of runs per day and has you stick to a particular <em>heart rate zone</em> instead, so it's less about results and more about individual effort.</p><p>If you're new to running, the Pixel Watch 3 is an excellent option; two other Android Central editors who aren't regular runners have told me that its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-cardio-load-and-target-load-explained">Cardio Load and auto-generated workouts</a> make running more accessible to them. Otherwise, people looking to get seriously into running should look into the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/which-garmin-forerunner-model-right-me">Garmin Forerunner</a> series — especially since several of them are discounted for Cyber Monday right now!</p>

<p>In recent years, I've grown kind of tired of the subpar experience offered by Amazon tablets. However, the Amazon Fire Max 11 remains in my rotation and is a sneaky Cyber Monday deal you shouldn't ignore. That's because you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://amazon.com/dp/B0C1MYYFBW"><strong>save at least $90</strong></a>, if you want just the tablet, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://amazon.com/dp/B0C1MYYFBW">up to $130</a> for one of the Fire Max 11 bundles.</p><p>Whenever I'm asked about what Amazon tablet I would recommend, it's always the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-fire-max-11-review">Fire Max 11</a>. Although the Fire HD 8 has been improved, it just doesn't offer the same value that the Fire Max 11 provides. This is the same opinion I maintain even when it's not part of Amazon's Cyber Monday tablet deals.</p>
<div class="product"><a data-dimension112="4aaeeee0-d091-4544-b2bc-f5f626397170" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Stylus Bundle: $264.98" data-dimension48="Stylus Bundle: $264.98" data-dimension25="$139.99" href="https://amazon.com/dp/B0C1MYYFBW" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:962px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="kYNi2vcu7cdyeP6XFbBPuZ" name="Amazon Fire Max 11 render.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kYNi2vcu7cdyeP6XFbBPuZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="962" height="962" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>It can be tough navigating the sea of bad tablets on Cyber Monday, but the Amazon Fire Max 11 easily stands head and shoulders above the crowd. Not only can you save almost $100 on just the tablet, but Amazon offers a couple of bundles that might be of interest.  </p><p><strong>Fire Max 11 Bundles: <br></strong>- <strong>Stylus Bundle: </strong><a href="https://amazon.com/dp/B0C1N3G19K" data-dimension112="4aaeeee0-d091-4544-b2bc-f5f626397170" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Stylus Bundle: $264.98" data-dimension48="Stylus Bundle: $264.98" data-dimension25="$139.99"><del>$264.98</del><strong> $174.98<br></strong></a>- <strong>Productivity Bundle: </strong><a href="https://amazon.com/dp/B0C1MYYFBW"><del>$354.97</del><strong> $224.99</strong></a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://amazon.com/dp/B0C1MYYFBW" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="4aaeeee0-d091-4544-b2bc-f5f626397170" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Stylus Bundle: $264.98" data-dimension48="Stylus Bundle: $264.98" data-dimension25="$139.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>While other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-kindle-fire-tablet">Fire tablets</a> make plenty of sacrifices in the name of being cheap, the same can't be said about the Fire Max 11. It's about as premium of a tablet as you could ask for at this price point and is easily the best Fire Tablet for a variety of reasons.</p><p>It all starts with the 11-inch display, featuring a 2000x1200 resolution, so everything looks super crisp on the screen. Despite it not being the most powerful tablet out there, it's still more than capable of handling multitasking. And if you're not the biggest fan of Amazon's interface, there are ways around this so you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-sideload-android-apps-amazon-fire-tablet">install the Play Store</a> and load up a third-party launcher of your choice.</p><p>Those who are looking for a tablet that pulls double (or triple) duty, then you might be intrigued by the Fire Max 11 Productivity Bundle. In addition to the tablet, this bundle also includes a detachable back cover and keyboard, along with the Amazon Stylus Pen. This would normally set you back just north of $350, but Amazon's Cyber Monday deals have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://amazon.com/dp/B0C1MYYFBW"><strong>knocked $130 off the price</strong></a>.</p><p>There's even a "bundle" that includes the tablet and stylus which is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://amazon.com/dp/B0C1N3G19K"><strong>also $90 off</strong></a>, bringing the price down to just under $175. You'll still need to grab a case, but hey, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://amazon.com/dp/B0BPJYB2RP">Magnetic Slim Cover</a> is on sale for Cyber Monday too!</p>

While Soundcore is a trusted brand, its VR P10 earbuds are old news and only work properly with the Quest 2. Instead, you should get PrismXR Vega T1 headphones which just hit a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/PRISMXR-Low-Latency-Connection-Compatible-Playstation/dp/B0CDH3SMDW"><strong>historic low price of $49.99</strong></a> on the day before Cyber Monday! The previous best price was $55.99 on Black Friday.</p><p>Aside from delivering ultra-low latency audio via the included USB-C dongle, PrismXR Vega T1 earbuds provide the full 27W passthrough capabilities it takes to keep the Quest 3 charged while playing. Soundcore VR P10 earbuds only offer 18W passthrough charging, which is <em>not enough</em> to charge the Quest 3, only to slow down the battery drain.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You are looking to keep VR play session audio in your ears only. The Quest's built-in speakers are great but sometimes it's better to not have the entire room hear the games you're playing, especially when they involve foul-mouthed gamers online. As a bonus, the USB-C dongle can be plugged into a Nintendo Switch or Steam Deck for quicker wireless audio pairing than Bluetooth offers.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You find earbuds uncomfortable. PrismXR Vega T1 earbuds are super comfortable for me, but not everyone likes the feel of something in their ears.</p><p>PrismXR makes a ton of fantastic Meta Quest accessories including the Vega T1 earbuds. Aside from providing passthrough charging, Vega T1 earbuds offer ground-breaking 25ms latency for wireless audio. Comparatively, Bluetooth earbuds introduce between 50-100ms of latency which can be very uncomfortable in VR.</p><p>These earbuds come with a handy carrying case that keeps them charged — as you probably expect from a modern pair of wireless earbuds — so you don't have to worry about them being dead the next time you go to play.</p><p>Plus, with a great set of microphones on each bud, your friends will hear you better than ever before while gaming.</p>

Anker&apos;s chargers are the absolute best, but they usually cost a pretty penny. Lucky for you, this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/cyber-monday">Cyber Monday</a> deal drives down the price of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZ6LXL8R"><strong>Anker Prime Charger (100W, 3 Ports, GaN) by 46% on Amazon</strong></a>, so you can get it for roughly <strong>HALF</strong> the usual price. Talk about a bargain!</p><p>Anker makes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-phone-charger">best USB-C chargers</a> in the industry. The brand&apos;s charging solutions might be pricey, but they never fall short of the mark. The name Anker screams reliability and high quality. If you need a phone charger, car charger, power bank, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/black-friday-chromebook-deals-2024-score-major-savings-on-acer-lenovo-samsung-and-more">Chromebook</a> charger, or cable, it&apos;s the right brand to choose.</p><p>GaN chargers are usually very compact and excellent at managing heat. That&apos;s why they are usually more expensive than regular old USB-C chargers. Naturally, when the rated power output and number of ports go up, so does the price. So if you need a new charger, I&apos;d say take advantage of this deal now, before stock runs out. It&apos;s already out of stock at Walmart!</p>

<p>This Anker Prime USB-C brick comes with three ports and pushes out 100W of power. That's plenty of ports and power to charge two to three devices at their max speeds, including laptops and Chromebooks. GaN technology keeps heat levels low and foldable prongs make this charger easy to store and carry. At 46%, this is the best Cyber Monday deal on an Anker product we've seen yet.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://amazon.com/dp/B0CZ6LXL8R" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="7da4949c-aa2c-4807-ab4d-ce7c032f22b4" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Anker Prime Charger (100W, 3 Ports, GaN): $84.99" data-dimension48="Anker Prime Charger (100W, 3 Ports, GaN): $84.99" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you charge multiple devices at once, especially laptops and Chromebooks that require 65W or higher; you need both USB-C and USB-A ports.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you still think $46 is too much for a charger.</p><p>The Anker Prime 100W GaN Charger is pretty small for a three-pronged charging brick. You get two USB-C and one USB-A port, as well as foldable prongs to reduce the compact charger&apos;s size even more.</p><p>Anker&apos;s proprietary PowerIQ 3.0 and Active Shield 2.0 technologies work together to deliver 100W of power intelligently, safely, and efficiently. The charger smartly chooses how much power to split and send to each port depending on how many ports and which exact ones are in use.</p><p>If you feel this deal still isn&apos;t worth your while, you might want to rethink your decision. You&apos;ll definitely find cheaper chargers, but not necessarily better or faster ones.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You want a powerful Bluetooth speaker with great sound and a bold design. <br><br><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You need a speaker that's easy to carry anywhere.</p>
<p>The StormBox Blast has two 30W mid-woofers alongside dual 15W tweeters, and it produces 90W of sound. The sound quality is great out of the box, but if you need to tweak the bass or change the sound characteristics, you can easily do so with the Tribit app. Honestly, this thing gets loud enough to fill a medium-sized room, and there are zero issues when it comes to audio quality. <br><br>There's an XBass mode that cranks up the bass to a noticeable degree, and you don't get any distortion even with the volume all the way up. I averaged over 20 hours of music playback between charges, and I didn't have any problems with Bluetooth connectivity — it pairs over Bluetooth 5.3. <br><br>I also like the design quite a bit; it has 32 LEDs at the front, and they pulse according to the music. Interestingly, it has a power bank mode that lets you charge other devices with it, but it only goes up to 10W. There's IPX7 ingress protection as well, and you can easily use it outdoors or at the pool. The only quibble I have with it is that it takes too long to charge, but outside of that, the StormBox Blast is a phenomenal Bluetooth speaker, and you don't get anything that sounds as good <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Tribit-StormBox-Blast-Portable-Speaker/dp/B09PMYTJD2">for $139 this Cyber Monday</a>.</p>

I had to travel recently, so instead of the Oasis, I took the Voyage. While the Voyage also has a similar-quality screen, the page turn buttons on the sides are woefully inadequate, and I hated using it. <br><br>That is the case with all new Kindles as well, with Amazon ditching physical page turn buttons altogether. Thankfully, DATAFY's accessory solves this problem; the accessory attaches to the side of the e-reader, and you can use the bundled remote control to physically turn pages on your Kindle. It's a novel solution, and it transforms how you use an e-reader. Best of all, it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/DATAFY-Paperwhite-eReaders-Recording-Triggers/dp/B0CN6SSC17">just $15 right now</a>, so you're not spending too much cash either.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if:</strong> You need a page turner button to use with your e-reader. <br><strong><br>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You need a button that goes to previous page as well as the next one.</p>
<p>The best part about the Oasis is the physical page-turn buttons; you just get much better tactility, and I got so used to the feature that I can't go back to a regular Kindle. It's annoying that Amazon doesn't sell the Oasis any longer, nor is there a new model that includes page turn buttons. The only alternative is to use an accessory like the DATAFY attachment, and to its credit, it does a great job. <br><br>The dongle attaches to the Kindle, and the page turning is by way of a remote that you hold in your hand. The remote uses an RF signal to connect to the dongle, and it doesn't need Bluetooth. Battery life is great, and it charges over USB-C. The only issue is that because it connects to one side, you can use it to go to the next page in a book; if you need to go back, you'll need to use the touch controls on the other side.</p>

The Balance has many pros to its name, but the best feature about this smartwatch is undoubtedly its battery life which goes up to 20 days.</p><p>This Cyber Monday deal brings down the price of the Amazfit Balance by a whopping 30%. If you want to take up on this offer, it&apos;s available on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://amazon.com/dp/B0C7GGYS7M"><strong>Amazon for $139.99</strong></a>. For a wearable that usually costs about $200, that&apos;s an insanely good discount!</p><p>I just reviewed the Amazfit Balance and gave it a very good rating. What sets this watch apart is the AI features baked in, like Zepp Flow, Zepp Coach, and Zepp Aura. It uses AI to learn from your metrics and design strategies for you to hit your fitness goals smartly, based on the data collected.</p><p>The smartwatch also has plenty of watch faces, a solid companion app, and over 150 sports modes. Then there&apos;s also a ton of health tracking metrics such as heart rate monitoring, SpO2 monitoring, sleep tracking, menstrual tracking, and more! It&apos;s one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-amazfit-smartwatch">best Amazfit smartwatches</a> for sure, and easy on the eyes too.</p>

<p>The Amazfit Balance destroys every other smartwatch when it comes to battery life. A single full charge can last you two to three weeks easily, so you will never have battery anxiety again. Other than that, the Balance is extremely lightweight, boasts 5ATM waterproofing, and comes with over 150 sports modes. With 30% off this Cyber Monday, the watch is cheaper than it has ever been.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you hate charging your wearable, require NFC for payments, want Alexa onboard, and like to track your health and fitness metrics.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you want access to a lot more third-party apps and need an accurate pedometer as a serious sportsperson.</p><p>If you&apos;re interested in a full-length evaluation of the Amazfit Balance, you can read my in-depth review. What I can summarize for you is that this is an excellent budget smartwatch that works really well for everyday use. This smartwatch has Alexa onboard, a built-in speaker and mic combo, as well as GPS and NFC for payments.</p><p>I also love the fact that you can store music locally on your Amazfit Balance and pair your Bluetooth headphones or earbuds with it directly. And if you forgot your earbuds, it just plays the music out loud through the watch&apos;s speaker.</p><p>Although the Amazfit Balance doesn&apos;t support hundreds and thousands of apps like Wear OS, the current selection of apps is decent enough. You can respond to messages on the notification bar with a full QWERTY keyboard too, which was not an option on older Amazfit smartwatches. It&apos;s not as capable as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watch</a>, but still an excellent smart wearable for the price.</p>
