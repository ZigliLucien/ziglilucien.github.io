I had over 75 phones delivered this year, and whether it's the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-is-the-most-exciting-phone-around">tri-folding Huawei Mate XT</a>, the incredibly-thin <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">OPPO Find N5</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-magic-v5-review">Honor Magic V5</a>, the vibrant <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-17-pro-review">iPhone 17 Pro</a> (I got the orange one), or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/oppo-find-x8-ultra-review">Find X8 Ultra</a> with its outstanding cameras, there have been plenty of standouts this year.</p><p>Most flagships started using silicon batteries, leading to devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/oppo-find-x9-pro-review">Find X9 Pro</a> and its 7,500mAh battery, and Vivo outdid itself with the cameras on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x300-pro-review">X300 Pro</a>. While these phones are limited to select global regions, there's a decent selection of phones to consider if you're in North America.</p><p>Google got its act together this year with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/with-the-pixel-10-pro-xl-google-finally-made-a-faultless-flagship">Pixel 10 Pro XL</a>, delivering a flagship that excels in all areas. The Pixel 9a, meanwhile, is the best budget phone around. And if you need an all-rounder that gets everything right, the OnePlus 13 is still my go-to recommendation. With Black Friday in the past and Cyber Monday set to roll out, now is the best time to buy a phone if you're looking to do so.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="7743feec-970a-42cc-aeca-0766f48f949b" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="The Pixel 9a is all the phone you need if you just want a budget device with great cameras.

With phone prices going up next year, this is the best time to get a new phone while they're still relatively affordable, and there are decent deals to be had. The Pixel 9a is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Gemini-Smartphone-Incredible/dp/B0DVHTT1GS">now selling at just $349</a>, and honestly, it's a terrific choice if you just need a reliable phone. It nails the basics, has a great in-hand feel, and the rear design is pretty great thanks to a camera module that sits flush with the body. The cameras are the best in this category, you get a clean software with fast updates, and there isn't much missing on this phone.</p><p>If you've used a Samsung phone and are considering switching over to another manufacturer, I highly recommend the OnePlus 13, which is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Smartphone-Snapdragon-SUPERVOOC-Hasselblad/dp/B0DP8KZLQ3">now down to $699</a>. It's significantly more affordable than the Galaxy S25 models, but you still get amazing cameras, better battery life than any Samsung phone, and a level of fluidity that One UI can't come close to.</p><p>And if you're ready to embrace AI features and want a phone that does the best job in this area, you should get the Pixel 10 Pro XL. The phone usually costs $1,199, but Google has a $300 discount right now, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Pro-Smartphone-Fast-Charging/dp/B0FFTSKP7M/">bringing it down to $899</a>. That's still quite a lot of cash, but the Pixel 10 Pro XL is the best Google phone yet, and having used every single Pixel in the last decade, I'm confident in recommending the device.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The inside of the case has a lining to protect the rear of the iPhone 17 Pro while it's housed within, and all Nomad cases have neodymium magnets as standard, ensuring full MagSafe usability.</p><p>This variant of the case has a polycarbonate frame at the sides with a glass Camera Control button, and the power and volume buttons are made out of aluminum and have good tactility. I like the feel of the leather, and my cases came with Horween leather, which is exquisite. I also have a regular vegetable-tanned leather case, and while it also is great in-hand, the Horween models just feel better.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div

island, and it does just as good a job at the front, with the raised sides ensuring the panel doesn't take much damage should the phone take a tumble. If you want a full-leather design, the Traditional Leather Case extends the leather to the sides as well, and you can get this model with Horween leather as well.</p><p>The Rugged Leather Case kicks things up a notch, providing all-around protection that comes with a decent amount of bulk. Honestly, I don't think you need this case unless you want to be absolutely sure; the regular leather cases get 8ft tumble protection, while the rugged model pushes that to 15ft.</p><div

And while battery life is usually a concern with Find My trackers, and since this one is built into the wallet, ESR includes a cable in the box so you can recharge it easily.</p><p>ESR claims up to six months of use on a single charge, and I've drained roughly 50% in two months, so it may depend on your usage. You can also charge the wallet directly from your phone using the included cable.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="gi8d9J3ZopqiHKkcPtar4f" name="esr-geo-wallet-charging" alt="ESR Geo Wallet on charging" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gi8d9J3ZopqiHKkcPtar4f.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sanuj Bhatia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Moreover, it includes RFID-blocking to keep your data secure. The wallet also offers plenty of space, allowing you to store up to nine cards plus two ID cards side by side. It comes in black, brown, and a carbon-fiber finish, though I'm personally a fan of the black variant. Durability has been great so far with zero issues to the faux leather finish over the past few months.</p><p>The only downside, in my opinion, is that it's compatible only with iPhone and Apple devices since it supports only Find My, leaving Android users out. If you own an iPhone, though, it's more than good enough.</p><p>We've reached out to the company to ask whether a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/find-my-device-is-out-googles-new-find-hub-is-officially-in">Google Find My Device</a> version is coming, but until then, this makes for a great holiday-season gift.</p><h2 id="more-black-friday-2025-quick-links-2">More Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>major discounts on Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>official Black Friday discounts on tablets, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

After all, it's often easier to finance a smartphone than to buy one outright. Fortunately, there are some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-review"><strong>pretty good promotions available</strong></a> for one of this year's best AI phones.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus</a> normally costs $999, which is a pretty penny for a rather impressive phone. However, T-Mobile customers can grab one of the best deals of Black Friday, where they pay absolutely nothing for the phone, except maybe some taxes.

These earbuds look like their more premium Pro counterparts and feature ANC to help block out the noise. Even better, the earbuds give some Galaxy AI features, so you can easily chat with Gemini or translate conversations with the press of a button.</p><p>That said, you must purchase the earbuds with the Galaxy S25 Plus in this online-exclusive deal. After that, you'll need to enter your earbuds receipt information on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://promotions.t-mobile.com/"><strong>T-Mobile's promotion website</strong></a>, and you'll receive a Mastercard for the amount you paid for the earbuds.</p><p>All in all, you're getting two very good Samsung devices for the price of nothing. All you need to do is be on the right plan and trade in an eligible smartphone (Galaxy S20, OnePlus 10 Pro, iPhone 12 Pro, Pixel 6, and Razr Plus 2023 or newer).</p><h2 id="black-friday-2025-quick-links-2">Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The Anker Nano Power Bank is incredibly useful for many reasons, but the main ones are the charging speed and built-in USB-C cable.</p><p>It supports 45W charging, which is faster than most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Galaxy phones</a> can charge, while still being quick enough for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> that support faster speeds. As for the USB-C cable, it's retractable, meaning it's hidden when you don't need it, and you just have to pull it out to extend it up to 2.3 feet. And if you want to charge multiple devices, the power bank also comes with a USB-C port and a USB-A port.</p><p>With a 10,000mAh capacity, it'll be able to provide a full charge to your smartphone and then some, or provide a decent charge to multiple devices.</p><p>There's a small display so you can monitor temperature as well as real-time charging speed, and it'll even give you an estimate of how much charge time you have remaining. And to help with portability, the power bank comes with a loop.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="JXpPtM67NfeQH4T9D86fcX" name="Anker-MagGo-Power-Bank-5K-hands-on-14" alt="The Anker MagGo Power Bank 5K on the Pixel 10" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JXpPtM67NfeQH4T9D86fcX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The MagGo Power Bank is a bit more niche, since it's a Qi2 wireless charger, but as more Android phones gain support for the standard, it's definitely a charger you'll want in your arsenal. It's surprisingly thin for a 5,000mAh power bank and supports 15W speeds (or 20W with the USB-C port). The magnets are great because you can stick them to the back of your phone and not have to worry about carrying it awkwardly.</p><p>And as a plus, it's also good for charging smaller devices like wireless earbuds.</p><h2 id="black-friday-2025-quick-links-7">Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Other models, like the Garmin Fenix 8 and Venu X1, are smarter and flashier. However, neither the Fenix 8 nor the Venu X1 can last as long as the Garmin Enduro 3. Even as I’ve dabbled with other smartwatches, I keep coming back the Enduro, and it’s still on-sale after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/black-friday">Black Friday</a> as we look ahead to Cyber Monday.</p><p>To truly appreciate how crazy it is that the Enduro 3 is only $750 for a limited time, you need a bit of backstory. Garmin loaded the Enduro 3 full of features, but shaved $200 off the retail price compared to the Enduro 2. So, the Garmin Enduro 3 is already a solid value at $900, but it’s way better when Amazon, Best Buy, and Target take another $150 off.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="94168ca0-7368-4bde-a113-cc54fd4e1c41" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Best Buy - $749.99" data-dimension48="Best Buy - $749.99" data-dimension25="$749.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-EnduroTM-Ultraperformance-Smartwatch-Built/dp/B0DD5N9G17" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="bbPXWV9bzZTtopndFG97Xn" name="Garmin Enduro 3" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bbPXWV9bzZTtopndFG97Xn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>The Garmin Enduro 3 packs the best Garmin sensors into a rugged shell offering up to 36 days of battery life on a single charge.

I use the state-of-the-art Garmin Elevate v5 heart rate sensor to track regular walking, running, and hiking workouts, plus the occasional sleep tracking session. Even with all of that GPS tracking, I consistently get at least three weeks of usage out of the Enduro 3. When the dreaded “low battery” notification comes in, I usually have <em>another week</em> to charge it.</p><p>I rotate a few other premium smartwatches in, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-review">Samsung Galaxy Watch 8</a> and the Apple Watch Ultra 3. But guess which watch I turn to when I forget to charge one of those models on a given night? The Garmin Enduro 3. I can take it on a work trip and <em>leave the charger at home</em>. This kind of battery will change your life as soon as you give it a try.</p><p>More recently, I’ve been loving all of Garmin’s third-party app integrations. The Garmin Connect platform gets a bit data-dense for me at times, but I have my Enduro 3 set up to automatically upload my workout data to Nike Run Club and Meta AI as well. So, I can use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oakley-meta-vanguard-smart-glasses-review">Autocapture with Garmin on my Oakley Meta Vanguard</a> sunglasses to track my runs and record live video thanks the Enduro 3. Plus, it’s all cross-platform, so I can pair my Garmin with iOS and Android as needed.</p><p>The Garmin Enduro 3 is a sleeper pick, especially with $150 off until this deal runs out. It might not be as sexy as the Fenix 8 or Venu X1, but it’s irreplaceable for me. If you’re tired of nightly (or weekly) charging and want the best Garmin tech, grab this Enduro 3 deal while you can.</p><h2 id="black-friday-2025-quick-links-12">Black Friday 2025 — quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><em><strong>Black Friday Samsung Galaxy deals</strong></em></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><em><strong>Black Friday Google Pixel deals</strong></em></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><em><strong>Black Friday Motorola deals</strong></em></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

We also like them for their superb battery life and their ease of use through the Sony Headphones Connect app, which has EQ and other controls. The earbuds also include an IPX4 water resistance rating, as well as fast charging through the USB-C cable and Qi wireless charging. They're definitely on the pricey side of the earbuds spectrum, making deals like this particularly worth taking advantage of.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$328.00" data-dimension48="$328.00" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/sony-wf1000xm5-true-wireless-noise-cancelling-earbuds-black/J7XSRH53VJ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:420px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="4ZY9knHp8ropTFjbbetNSb" name="sony-wf-1000XM5-leak-black.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4ZY9knHp8ropTFjbbetNSb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="420" height="420" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Sony WF-1000XM5 earbuds:</strong> <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/sony-wf1000xm5-true-wireless-noise-cancelling-earbuds-black/J7XSRH53VJ" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$328.00" data-dimension48="$328.00" data-dimension25=""><del>$328.00</del> <strong>$228 at Best Buy</strong></a></p><p>Sony's powerful WF-1000XM5 earbuds are currently selling for $80 off at Best Buy, as the retailer soft launches some early Black Friday discounts.

If the wall plug placement in your home is terrible, you can get a couple of these towers and strips to make those plugs easily accessible.</p><p>Instead of pushing the bed, couch, or table every time to plug and unplug an adapter, you can simply set up TESSAN's multiplugs or towers in strategic locations around your house. I like to keep the 11-outlet tower under my office table as I usually have a million devices plugged in. The flat strip is perfect for the bedroom as it can sit behind your bed or on your bedside table.</p><p>You don't even need to worry about overloading these extensions, as all of them come with surge protection and very high power ratings to begin with.</p><h2 id="black-friday-2025-quick-links-27">Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More post-Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

My fiancée also uses hers regularly, though her pair is in much better shape and should last a couple more years. In my case, I don't mind having to buy a new pair after nearly four years, considering the great price.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="ef1e54de-2a25-4435-b8f7-d7cc4b37a603" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="or: Sony ZX headphones with mic: $34.99" data-dimension48="or: Sony ZX headphones with mic: $34.99" data-dimension25="$12.99" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/sony-zx-series-wired-on-ear-headphones-black/J7XSRHW9LS" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="bMNAY36JsEYYZh9hjchkc5" name="sony-zx-wired-on-ear-headphones" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bMNAY36JsEYYZh9hjchkc5.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>or: Sony ZX headphones with mic: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OUX6U6G" data-dimension112="ef1e54de-2a25-4435-b8f7-d7cc4b37a603" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="or: Sony ZX headphones with mic: $34.99" data-dimension48="or: Sony ZX headphones with mic: $34.99" data-dimension25="$12.99"><del>$34.99</del><strong> $19.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>These 3.5mm headphones have a 12 Hz–22 kHz frequency created with 1.38-inch neodymium dynamic drivers. They're on-ear, rather than over-ear, which minimizes passive noise cancellation; you might see this as a negative, but I prefer on-ear so that they don't get sweaty or feel constricting for eight-hour days, and I can hear when someone in the room is speaking to me. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/sony-zx-series-wired-on-ear-headphones-black/J7XSRHW9LS" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="ef1e54de-2a25-4435-b8f7-d7cc4b37a603" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="or: Sony ZX headphones with mic: $34.99" data-dimension48="or: Sony ZX headphones with mic: $34.99" data-dimension25="$12.99">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You want reliable audio quality for your workday playlist, a lightweight fit that won't feel uncomfortable by 5 p.m. or press into your glasses arms, and a low price that saves your tech budget for wireless earbuds instead.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You need either active or passive noise cancellation, or you're the kind of audiophile who needs more advanced drivers from flagship headphones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/sony-wh-1000xm6-review">Sony WH-1000XM6</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bose-qc-ultra-headphones-review">Bose QuietComfort Ultra</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="bgQAzmtBMTr8qbrQstyr9o" name="Sony-ZX-headphones-new-vs-old" alt="Two pairs of Sony ZX wired on-ear headphones sitting on a blanket, the closer pair notably worn down compared to the other." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bgQAzmtBMTr8qbrQstyr9o.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">My pair has seen some wear-and-tear </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'm <em>not</em> an expert on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">best wireless headphones</a>; most of my colleagues' picks are on sale for Black Friday if you're willing to spend hundreds more.

It makes a difference!</p><p>The Sony ZX series is quite popular, with hundreds of thousands of solid reviews on Amazon and Best Buy combined, because of its simple quality and affordability paired with a household name. This Black Friday deal price isn't the lowest ever; it's fallen as low as $9.99 before. But don't fall into the Black Friday deal trap trying to "save" as much money as possible; $13 for headphones that'll last for years is great.</p><p>Personally, I prefer the ZXs with the mic, which captures perfectly clear sound for my colleagues on remote calls or teammates during multiplayer Baldur's Gate sessions. But it's up to you whether you want to save a few more bucks or not! Either way, I'm off to buy a new pair for myself.</p><h2 id="more-black-friday-deals-quick-links-2">More Black Friday deals - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

But by a stroke of luck, I happened to see this deal from Walmart, which was the last place I expected to have the best tablet deal.</p><p>When there aren't a bunch of Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals going on, the Galaxy Tab S10 FE+ is actually a difficult recommendation. It's not because of the features or functionality, but it all comes down to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Processor-Note-Taking-Manufacturer-Warranty/dp/B0DVZWJL91">$649 retail price</a>.</p><p>For just $150 more, you can get the Galaxy Tab S11, which is equipped with a better screen and newer processor. Now the question becomes whether you should get the $409 Tab S10 FE+ or splurge on the Galaxy Tab S11, which is down to $649.</p><p>Honestly, if the Tab S11 were a bit cheaper, it would make for a more difficult decision. But I'd probably still go with the Tab S10 FE+, as it lets you keep some money to splurge on dinner with, or to pick up some of the other Black Friday/Cyber Monday deals you come across.</p><h2 id="black-friday-2025-quick-links-32">Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

For the last several years, phones like the Galaxy Z Flip and Motorola Razr have become more commonplace in a sea of flat slabs. But while flip phones sell by the millions each year, there are still a ton of people who are wary of foldable phones or question the purpose of flip phones.</p><p>I've used Motorola Razr (and some Galaxy Z Flip) phones for the past few years, and while I'm always stopped by people who express how cool the phones are, I've also met with some apprehension. Much of this is usually focused on durability, while some are simply disappointed that it's not an iPhone.</p><p>So why should you consider a flip phone as your next smartphone purchase?

Larger foldables like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-review">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a> maintain a normal smartphone size and expand out to something akin to a small tablet. However, a flip phone starts at a normal smartphone size and shrinks to roughly half that when closed.</p><p>Android Central's Jerry Hildenbrand loves this about his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2024-review">Razr 2024</a>, and Nick Sutrich's wife also enjoys how the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus 2024</a> can easily fit in any purse or pocket. Motorola and Samsung have also leaned in on this a bit with accessories like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/best-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-cases">ring stand cases for the Galaxy Z Flip</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/best-motorola-razr-ultra-2025-cases">crossbody cases/straps for the Motorola Razr</a>.</p><p>The only downside is that folding it in half essentially doubles the phone's thickness, so it may protrude more from your pocket. Fortunately, phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-review">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> are addressing this with noticeably thinner bodies.</p><h2 id="cover-screen-2">Cover screen</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FQksa84sZxrpW44LYMSQdB" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-review-09" alt="Apps on the Razr Ultra 2025 cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FQksa84sZxrpW44LYMSQdB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For me, the cover screen is probably my favorite part about using a flip phone like the excellent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Razr Ultra 2025</a>.

Just select the apps you want to access on the cover screen, arrange them how you want, and you're good to go.</p><p>The process <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/first-things-to-do-with-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">takes a bit more setup on the Galaxy Z Flip 7</a>, but you can still use your apps on the cover screen.</p><p>Scaling isn't always perfect, but for me, this is a great way to use apps more inconspicuously than if they filled your entire main screen, which is better for privacy in public spaces.</p><h2 id="camera-tricks-2">Camera tricks</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6aTDczcyarJiJsTPp6Tfde" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-review-07.jpg" alt="The Motorola Razr Plus 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6aTDczcyarJiJsTPp6Tfde.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This goes hand in hand with why I love the cover screen, but there's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-flip-phones-my-favorite-camera-tricks">more you can do with a flip phone camera</a> than with a regular smartphone. It's easy to take high-quality selfies with the primary camera because you can use the cover screen as a viewfinder. Furthermore, if you're taking a photo of someone else, you can show a preview of the viewfinder on the cover screen so they can see themselves before you take a photo. People <em>love </em>this feature (I know I do).</p><p>The flip phone's design lets you ditch the tripod for group shots. Just set the phone down and angle the hinge with the camera and cover screen viewfinder enabled. This makes it easy to capture hands-free photos and videos, making it great for TikTok videos, too!</p><p>Finally, Motorola and Samsung flip phones come with an Auto Camcorder feature that transforms your phone into a mini camcorder. Fold the phone at a 90-degree angle, and the camera UI transforms so you can hold it like you would a camcorder and capture smoother video. It's really quite neat and makes you feel a bit like a filmmaker.</p><h2 id="they-re-actually-durable-2">They're actually durable</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GUVnpZPGvaat87e8gQej6Q" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-7-Review-10" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GUVnpZPGvaat87e8gQej6Q.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>People are justifiably concerned about the longevity of foldable phones. After all, it's a <em>folding piece of glass</em>. In the early days, we saw plenty of examples of foldables cracking, failing, and ultimately proving why most consumers should shy away from these devices until companies made them more durable and reliable.</p><p>Fortunately, in the year of our lord 2025, foldables are much more durable than they used to be. Most foldables have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/is-the-motorola-razr-2025-waterproof">high water resistance rating</a>, meaning they can be submerged without issue. Newer foldables even have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-waterproof">dust resistance</a>, so you shouldn't have to worry as much about small particles messing up the internals (like the hinge).</p><p>Furthermore, the glass and folding mechanisms have also improved. The display crease is much less noticeable, and displays have been tested to withstand more than 400,000 folds without faltering, which should result in years of use.</p><h2 id="the-pure-nostalgia-2">The pure nostalgia</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1199px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.21%;"><img id="x4XvN8hvUfuuZneM8R7sHP" name="Moto-Razr-Plus-2024-Paris-Edition" alt="Moto Razr Paris Edition" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/x4XvN8hvUfuuZneM8R7sHP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1199" height="674" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you're a millennial like me, then you should fully remember the days of the original Razr.

According to their discovery, Gemini is supposedly preparing a new "annotation" feature for images that users prompt it to generate. Annotations seem to extend beyond just typing on your digital keyboard, as it seems users can "draw and add text to generated images," per the tipster.</p><p>The tipster provided a snapshot of this alleged feature, showing how Gemini will offer a horizontal color palette. More importantly, there are two options beneath it: a squiggly line for drawing and a classic "T" for text.</p><p>Curiously, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/DarrenTjan/status/1993828007962980498?s=20">another user</a> chimed in, who also seemingly discovered this in-the-works feature, claiming that users can soon "resubmit" those annotated images. The user states, "I'm currently downloading the image, circling, arrowing, and putting text instructions before resubmitting with a prompt." So, instead of writing out your prompt again, after Gemini failed to generate what you'd like, users <em>might </em>be able to draw/write those specific changes on the image.</p><p>This sounds like a rather easy way of directly impacting how the AI behaves when you're looking for those minute aspects to change. Currently, there's no word on when we could see this feature arrive in the Gemini app.</p><h2 id="mark-it-up-make-the-change-2">Mark it up, make the change</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Google is working on an image annotation feature for Gemini.

"Generate me a coloring page" 🍌 pic.twitter.com/mknesNVwrp<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1993824547926052911">November 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>Google has been implementing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/geminis-built-in-ai-image-editor-is-here-to-mess-with-your-photos-directly">methods for image editing</a> in Gemini natively since earlier this year. The editor works for those generated by AI and photos taken by users themselves. Google stated that users could change backgrounds, add or remove objects, and blend photos using the AI's capabilities. Users could also tell Gemini a story and have the AI try and match that with its AI visuals.</p><p>What's been rumored now brings that human element in a little more, by enabling users to directly engage with the AI's results, instead of starting from zero again.</p><p>Gemini's image capabilities were recently extended, as Google revealed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/nano-banana-goes-pro-with-refined-design-consistency-and-accuracy-in-the-gemini-app">Nano Banana Pro</a>. During its announcement, Google said the model was capable of generating "more accurate and content-rich images for users." Additionally, Nano Banana Pro clears up its legibility for text, fonts, and more. In a way, perhaps this is in preparation for this annotation feature, but we'll have to wait and see.</p> ]]></dc:content>

All these new phones are uncomfortable to hold and ugly to look at, but a skin and a case from Dbrand fixes most of that in just a few seconds. Thankfully, Dbrand <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://dbrand.com/black-friday"><strong>is slashing 40% off</strong></a> its normal prices during its post-Black Friday sale, meaning you have exactly 2 days to get a clue and get something from Dbrand.</p><p>To sweeten the deal, Dbrand is tossing in a free set of edgy Dbrand playing cards and dropping in free shipping for orders over $65. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://dbrand.com/black-friday/grip/google-pixel-10-pro-xl-cases?addons=prism&design=tmnp">My personal favorite is the TMNP</a> (Teenage Mutant Ninja Pixel) style, which turns Pixel phones into a bona fide Ninja Turtle, complete with grippy sides and a pristine Prism glass screen protector on the front. It fixes all my problems with Google's annoying design, and it looks great doing it!</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="8ced8837-c621-4c9a-8672-0c078925cfed" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Dbrand cases, skins, and screen protectors at 40% off" data-dimension48="Dbrand cases, skins, and screen protectors at 40% off" href="https://dbrand.com/black-friday" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:802px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="uDKRZLrTnVsLNo6uYhEDXE" name="Dbrand Google Pixel 10 Skin" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uDKRZLrTnVsLNo6uYhEDXE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="802" height="802" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><a href="https://dbrand.com/black-friday" data-dimension112="8ced8837-c621-4c9a-8672-0c078925cfed" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Dbrand cases, skins, and screen protectors at 40% off" data-dimension48="Dbrand cases, skins, and screen protectors at 40% off" data-dimension25=""><strong>Dbrand cases, skins, and screen protectors at 40% off</strong></a></p><p>Dbrand has an extraordinarily wide range of cases, screen protectors, and its famous line of skins on sale for 40% off during Black Friday/Cyber Monday weekend, letting you reskin your ugly phone and add much-needed grip to its awful flat design.</p><p><strong>Price comparison: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/dbrand-ghost-case-with-pixelsnap-for-google-pixel-10-pro-xl-clear/J89GJY73C2">Best Buy - $45 ($5 off)</a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://dbrand.com/black-friday" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="8ced8837-c621-4c9a-8672-0c078925cfed" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Dbrand cases, skins, and screen protectors at 40% off" data-dimension48="Dbrand cases, skins, and screen protectors at 40% off" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You're like me and can't stand phones with flat, slippery sides that are hard to pick up and uncomfortable to hold, or if you think modern "clean" design is ugly and needs to look more interesting. You could also just get a skin or a screen protector and skip the case altogether.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You've got terrible taste in phones and think your naked Pixel 10 or Galaxy S25 somehow looks good.</p><p>I'm a big fan of Dbrand's products, and the company's famously flippant attitude is a great comic relief in an age where everyone is too dang serious, and everything is too dang expensive.</p><p>Slapping a skin on your phone not only makes it look great, but it also adds grippiness that modern metal-and-glass sandwiches simply don't have. If you want more protection, Dbrand makes Grip cases that are compatible with the company's skins, giving you the best of both worlds. Plus, the Prism line of screen protectors is obnoxiously easy to install and is, as Dbrand proudly claims, "idiot proof."</p><p>Dbrand's famous line of Killswitch cases <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://dbrand.com/black-friday/killswitch/nintendo-switch-2-cases"><strong>are also $45 off</strong></a>, and as they're my favorite Nintendo Switch 2 cases of all time, I can heartily recommend picking it up and fixing the ergonomic mess Nintendo created with its latest console.

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>We've entered that weird liminal space between <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/black-friday">Black Friday</a> and Cyber Monday sales, but if you're looking to grab a great tablet deal, it doesn't matter what you call it. Many of the best Android tablets we've ever used are still on sale following the main event last night, and I'm recommending three of my favorite picks below.</p><p>First off, when shopping for your discounted couch companion, it's important to ask yourself two quick questions: what will you use the tablet for, and how much can you spend? Do you need something bright and spacious for streaming movies and TV shows, or do you just need something simple and affordable to take on a road trip? No two <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablets</a> are made alike, so let's dive into my favorite Black Friday tablet deals of the season.</p><h2 id="three-of-the-web-s-best-tablet-deals-heading-into-cyber-monday-2">Three of the web's best tablet deals heading into Cyber Monday</h2><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="3eb4dca3-9cbd-4e41-8d91-7a4daa018a20" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$699.99" data-dimension48="$699.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FC2HCN1Q" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="WRmWzCVw8FpQoZ6ANfiRY5" name="oneplus-pad-3-with-keyboard-square-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WRmWzCVw8FpQoZ6ANfiRY5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>OnePlus Pad 3 256GB:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FC2HCN1Q" data-dimension112="3eb4dca3-9cbd-4e41-8d91-7a4daa018a20" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$699.99" data-dimension48="$699.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$699.99</del><strong> $579.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>It's no secret that we're huge fans of the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-3-review">OnePlus Pad 3</a>.

Most retailers have simply extended their Black Friday sales through the weekend and into Cyber Monday, so it's unlikely we'll see many <em>new </em>deals over the next few days. What you see is what you get, and you also run the risk of items selling out if you wait too long.</p><h2 id="where-can-i-find-the-best-black-friday-tablet-deals-2">Where can I find the best Black Friday tablet deals?</h2><p>Although I hate to recommend just one place, it seems like Amazon has been leading the charge with Black Friday tablet deals this year. That said, it never hurts to check sites like Best Buy and Walmart to see what they're offering, and I always visit the manufacturer's website itself before I hit that Buy Now button, just in case. If you're unsure about the quality of a deal, you can also use sites like <strong>Camelcamelcamel.com</strong> to check Amazon price history. </p><h2 id="what-is-the-best-android-tablet-2">What is the best Android tablet?</h2><p>Here at Android Central, we have decades of collective experience testing and reviewing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">best Android tablets</a> ever built. This year, Andrew Myrick, our senior editor with the most experience in the tablet space, has chosen the OnePlus Pad 3 is the best overall tablet that money can buy. It may not be the most powerful device ever built, but its price-to-performance ratio is unmatched and the build quality is a stunner. It also doesn't hurt that the Pad 3 comes with 12GB of RAM and is powered by the legendary Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset. </p><h2 id="more-black-friday-2025-quick-links-22">More Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Just two and a half years later, that same brilliant bundle <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Horizon-MountainTM-Bundle-PSVR2-5/dp/B0C1Q9X8VH/"><strong>is now down to $299</strong></a>, making it an irresistible addition to any PS5 gamer's setup.</p><p>This bundle includes the PSVR 2 headset, two controllers, and a copy of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/horizon-call-of-the-mountain">Horizon Call of the Mountain</a>. It's easily my favorite game in the Horizon Zero Dawn series, and it's one of the most beautiful VR games ever created. That's particularly excellent since it's included <em>free</em> in the box.</p><p>PSVR 2 requires a PS5 to play, but since nearly 100 million people already own one, you're likely set to enjoy one of the finest VR headsets to date without much fuss. So long as you've got that PS5, everything else you'll need is in this box. The PSVR 2 has hundreds of games to play, including big names like Resident Evil 7 and 8, Gran Turismo, Hitman World of Assassination, and many more titles you're going to love.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="3a4b1e91-5f80-4c90-9ff7-d1aa2754ed13" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$399" data-dimension48="$399" href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Horizon-MountainTM-Bundle-PSVR2-5/dp/B0C1Q9X8VH/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:900px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="8dix2b7u4Ehyhs3DVu9Q7P" name="psvr-2-horizon-cotm-bundle-official-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8dix2b7u4Ehyhs3DVu9Q7P.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="900" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>PlayStation VR2 Horizon COTM bundle:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Horizon-MountainTM-Bundle-PSVR2-5/dp/B0C1Q9X8VH/" data-dimension112="3a4b1e91-5f80-4c90-9ff7-d1aa2754ed13" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$399" data-dimension48="$399" data-dimension25=""><del>$399</del> <strong>$299 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>Unlock the power of your PS5 with the PSVR 2 and jump INTO your games.

Sony's edge is in its top-tier components, which include an OLED display, eye tracking, and advanced haptic feedback in both the controllers and headset.</p><p>Plus, there are a handful of exclusive games you can only get on the PSVR 2. Aside from the Sony-related IPs you might expect (like Horizon and Gran Turismo), the PSVR 2 features games with better graphics than the Meta Quest 3 can offer since it's powered by the PS5. Some exclusive titles, like Synapse, even use the PSVR 2's eye tracking to great effect, giving you kinetic powers that you can aim with just your eyes. It's unreal!</p><p>But there's no denying how good the Meta Quest 3S is, all at an even cheaper $199. To make that deal even sweeter, you don't need another console or PC to power a Meta Quest: it's a completely standalone VR console that doesn't use wires or limit your play space, and it has <em>even more</em> exclusive games than the PSVR 2.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="78af7b33-0407-4f27-b31a-dd812ab00362" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$299" data-dimension48="$299" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/meta-quest-3s-128gb-the-walking-dead-saints-sinners-bundle-dive-into-virtual-reality-white/J3LHRV8HL7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:816px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.12%;"><img id="vWNeMgNGUQRYB5p3BxhFSE" name="meta-quest-3s-w-walking-dead-render.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vWNeMgNGUQRYB5p3BxhFSE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="816" height="817" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Meta Quest 3S 128GB:</strong> <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/meta-quest-3s-128gb-the-walking-dead-saints-sinners-bundle-dive-into-virtual-reality-white/J3LHRV8HL7" data-dimension112="78af7b33-0407-4f27-b31a-dd812ab00362" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$299" data-dimension48="$299" data-dimension25=""><del>$299</del> <strong>$249, plus $50 gift card, free game, and more at Best Buy</strong></a></p><p>The Meta Quest 3S is currently on sale via multiple retailers for Black Friday, but Best Buy is one-upping the competition by throwing a $50 gift card into the mix.

The PSVR 2 only has black & white passthrough vision, which means no mixed reality content to be had.</p><p>Either route you choose, though, VR gamers are eating good this year, and with steep $100 off discounts for each of these headsets, it's the perfect year to finally jump into next-generation immersive gaming!</p><h2 id="black-friday-and-cyber-monday-2025-quick-links-2">Black Friday and Cyber Monday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More post-Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

However, one smartwatch that manages to nail everything is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch/oneplus-watch-3-43mm-hands-on">OnePlus Watch 3</a>.</p><p>The OnePlus Watch 3 easily delivers up to 5 days of battery life, has a solid mix of health and workout tracking features, and thanks to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/wear-os/wear-os-is-ditching-its-old-look-for-a-flashy-material-3-expressive-makeover">Wear OS</a>, supports all Android apps. And while we recommended buying this smartwatch even at its original $350 launch price in the U.S., this Black Friday deal makes it almost unmissable as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DYQ1QKF3/"><strong>Amazon is offering $100 off</strong></a> the OnePlus Watch 3.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="3c430f8f-f5e3-4928-b0c5-cfcf23b3297f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="The OnePlus Watch 3 is one of the most complete Wear OS smartwatches around, and at this Black Friday price, it's almost unbeatable since it brings everything you need from a smartwatch without burning a hole in your pocket." data-dimension48="The OnePlus Watch 3 is one of the most complete Wear OS smartwatches around, and at this Black Friday price, it's almost unbeatable since it brings everything you need from a smartwatch without burning a hole in your pocket." data-dimension25="$249.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DYQ1QKF3/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="PJbZoTraBTFQuxyV6DPDFi" name="OnePlus-Watch-3-green-and-black-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PJbZoTraBTFQuxyV6DPDFi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="3000" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>The OnePlus Watch 3 is one of the most complete Wear OS smartwatches around, and at this Black Friday price, it's almost unbeatable since it brings everything you need from a smartwatch without burning a hole in your pocket. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DYQ1QKF3/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="3c430f8f-f5e3-4928-b0c5-cfcf23b3297f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="The OnePlus Watch 3 is one of the most complete Wear OS smartwatches around, and at this Black Friday price, it's almost unbeatable since it brings everything you need from a smartwatch without burning a hole in your pocket." data-dimension48="The OnePlus Watch 3 is one of the most complete Wear OS smartwatches around, and at this Black Friday price, it's almost unbeatable since it brings everything you need from a smartwatch without burning a hole in your pocket." data-dimension25="$249.99">View Deal</a></p></div><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-amazon-deals-2025"><em><strong>The best 25 deals for Android users during Amazon's Black Friday sale</strong></em></a></li></ul><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You want a smartwatch with days-long battery life, solid health tracking, and a bright AMOLED display with great Wear OS app support.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You prefer a slim, lightweight watch and expect long-term software support.</p><p>OnePlus has been making smartwatches for a few years now, and the OnePlus Watch 3 is as good as it gets. It offers a large AMOLED display that's easily visible outdoors, whether you're running to work or hiking. The Watch's screen remains bright and readable in almost every situation.</p><p>However, the most impressive thing about this smartwatch isn't Wear OS, its build and design, or even the display. It's the battery life. Android Central reviewer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/author/nicholas-sutrich">Nicholas Sutrich</a> couldn't kill the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-review#section-oneplus-watch-3-what-you-ll-love">OnePlus Watch 3</a> in more than four days with all features on, including Always-On Display.</p><p>This is the level of endurance you usually see only on dedicated running watches like Garmin or Coros, but here you get that benefit on a Wear OS smartwatch too. For comparison, this is better battery life than what you'd get on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-review">Samsung Galaxy Watch 8</a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/google-pixel-watch-4-hands-on">Pixel Watch 4</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="c4Z2Qxc2HNYK7fALtXxBQC" name="oneplus-watch-3-battery-modes" alt="The two battery modes of the OnePlus Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/c4Z2Qxc2HNYK7fALtXxBQC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Long battery life doesn't mean fewer features either. The OnePlus Watch 3 offers a similar set of health-tracking features to other Wear OS watches, along with a physical rotating crown that makes navigating Wear OS easier without touching the screen much.</p><p>Of course, there are a few drawbacks as well, such as a bulkier build than some competitors, no LTE variant, and the fact that OnePlus will only provide two years of OS updates for the Watch 3. That said, at this price, it's all forgivable.</p><p>Bottom line, if you prefer a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS smartwatch</a> experience but still want the battery life of a non-Wear OS watch, the OnePlus Watch 3 is easily one of the best options you can buy this Black Friday.</p><h2 id="more-black-friday-2025-quick-links-27">More Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>major discounts on Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>official Black Friday discounts on tablets, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

While every major retailer has the Galaxy Ring on sale for the same price today, Best Buy is the best place to go because most of them offer sizing right in-store, making it easy to grab a Ring <em>today</em> instead of having to wait for a sizing kit to ship to your door.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="177e8b57-98b9-468f-8d5f-5a1eb7e4b6fb" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy Ring: $399" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy Ring: $399" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/samsung-galaxy-ring-size-before-you-buy-size-12-titanium-black-2024/J3ZYG2ZJ8F" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1631px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="PjGYwYg2vgeMwknCtD4Qab" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Ring-official-render-titanium-black.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PjGYwYg2vgeMwknCtD4Qab.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1631" height="1631" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy Ring: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/samsung-galaxy-ring-size-before-you-buy-size-12-titanium-black-2024/J3ZYG2ZJ8F" data-dimension112="177e8b57-98b9-468f-8d5f-5a1eb7e4b6fb" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy Ring: $399" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy Ring: $399" data-dimension25=""><del>$399</del> <strong>$279 at Best Buy</strong></a></p><p>At full price, the Samsung Galaxy Ring is simply an overpriced smart ring.

The Galaxy Ring is great for basic heart rate and step monitoring, but doesn't accurately offer advanced features like SpO2.</p><p>It's no secret that I strongly disliked the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Samsung Galaxy Ring</a> at launch. The Ring was overpriced and did very little considering that, but $279 changes the conversation quite a bit. If you're anything like me and don't like wearing watches throughout the day (or night), a smart ring like this could be the thing you're looking for.</p><p>As a whole, the Galaxy Ring is generally good at three things: 24/7 heart rate monitoring, step tracking, and sleep cycle tracking. Its 7-day battery life also means you can plop it on the charger at the end of the weekend and not have to think about it for the rest of the week.</p><p>The Galaxy Ring is <em>not</em> good at basically anything else. Don't expect it to give you advanced health metrics like SpO2, VO2 max, or function as a workout tracker. For that, you really just need to stick with a smartwatch or fitness band. If that sounds good to you, you won't find a better deal this year (or mayb ever) on this ring.</p><h2 id="black-friday-2025-quick-links-42">Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More post-Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

And while I liked it, I didn’t <em>LOVE</em> my experience. For starters, I had the basic 2022 Kindle. Super compact and easy to read on, my experience was dulled because I was using a device that was slightly older but at the same time was in black and white. I wanted to upgrade my device to a color model and was really going back and forth between the Libra and the Kindle Colorsoft. But I can’t begin to tell you how many people kept raving about the Kobo.</p><p>So I bit the bullet, bought the Kobo, was able to transfer my books over (which took a hot minute, but I figured it out), and I can officially say it’s going to be very hard to convince me to go back to a Kindle.</p><p>The Kobo is incredibly ergonomically designed for your comfort. With raised buttons on the side, you can actually hold it comfortably and turn the pages without it feeling awkward. I’ve read two books on my Kobo now, and both have been the most wonderful experiences. I get giddy every time I see the colored book covers on my e-reader, and whenever I highlight something, it’s so exciting to see different highlighter variants.</p><p>I haven’t gotten a stylus yet, but I think that’s going to be my next purchase.</p><p>Ultimately, my decision to switch to a Kobo has resulted in a much more comfortable experience. I get excited every time I pick up my device, and while I’ll never become an exclusive e-reader (I absolutely love my physical copy books!), I think this has just changed the game for me.</p><p>On a more notable point, the Kobo <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/libby-library-app-for-e-readers"><u>directly connects to the Libby app</u></a>, which allows you to easily borrow books from the library!</p><p>Anyway, listen, don’t make me try to convince you more. The Kobo Libra Colour is one of the best purchases I’ve ever made, and I guarantee that if you get it, you’re going to have an unputdownable experience reading your books.</p><h2 id="more-black-friday-2025-quick-links-32">More Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Our three <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">highest-rated smart glasses</a> are <em>all</em> on sale even after Black Friday is over, and the RayNeo Air 3s Pro are <em>even cheaper</em> now than they were just yesterday, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/RayNeo-Air-Pro-Glasses-SteamDeck/dp/B0FJRXSNWK/"><strong>down to an impressive $234</strong></a>.</p><p>All three pairs of glasses provide you with a massive wearable OLED display in a svelte glasses form factor, allowing you to plug them into your smartphone, Steam Deck, laptop, or several other devices. That gives you a personal, private screen that won't hurt your neck. Whether you're looking for the best image quality, lowest price, or widest range of compatible products, I'm here to help you make the right choice <em>today</em>.</p><h2 id="best-overall-smart-display-glasses-2">Best overall smart display glasses</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="3nxasAyAZkfzTZarDYJVYP" name="xreal-one-side-angle-lenses-01" alt="A pair of Xreal One smart glasses on a wooden tea tray" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3nxasAyAZkfzTZarDYJVYP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Xreal One has been our top choice since it launched earlier this year. My <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-one-review">Xreal One review</a> will help you understand what makes it the best if you want all the details, but the skinny is that Xreal One glasses come with the industry's first-ever dedicated chipset, allowing it to do things no other pair of glasses can. They're also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F7R96TFC"><strong>down to $399</strong></a>, the lowest price we've seen yet; a full $100 off!</p><p>Paramount to that experience is the ability to "mount" the virtual screen to an imaginary wall in front of you. When you plug Xreal One into any compatible device, the virtual screen in front of you stays in place just as a physical TV or monitor would, so you can move your head or body around normally, and that monitor will stay in place.</p><p>All other smart glasses "pin" the display to your face, which means that even the slightest jitter will make that display jostle and shake, and could give some people sore eyes or motion sickness. Xreal One's powerful chipset keeps this from happening, and the glasses even feature a built-in monitor-like settings menu that lets you fine-tune the image and several other options. Again, something no other pair of smart glasses can do.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="bd6374aa-83a8-4a19-9b76-3d041fe5ce2f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Take $100 off the normal price and enjoy the power of Xreal One with its dedicated, industry-first X1 chipset.

Typically, Samsung's device colors offer their distinct coloring on the back panel, leaving the frame with a lighter, almost metal hue. What Ice Universe suggests is that Samsung will change its darkest hue by wrapping the coloring over its edges, especially around its display.</p><p>The tipster states, "This time, the Galaxy S26 Ultra black version features a black frame." However, it seems consumers might be in for a slight visual anomaly if this happens.</p><p>The post on X states, "overall visual bezel is inevitably wider," because of the black edges around the display. The bezels are the black border around a display, a distinct marker that separates the display from its edges. If that <em>and </em>the frame is black, it might give the illusion that the S26 Ultr has massive bezels, when that (might not) be the case.</p><p>User comments on X have gone separate ways, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/emn_mora/status/1994011013981548727?s=20">some users praising</a> this potential, while others claim we're <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/joemama_0609/status/1993877598196388200?s=20">headed for scratch central</a>. Another tipster, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/theonecid/status/1993865319237210232?s=20">theonecid</a>, chimed in with a mock-up rendering of what a true Jet Black Galaxy S26 Ultra could look like. The frame is a little glossy, not quite as matte as what the series currently offers.

It's currently rumored that the S26 Ultra may adopt a more Galaxy Z Fold 7-style approach by adding that little island beneath its vertically lined cameras. This would, as you'd expect, give a bit of a camera bump, which the S25 Ultra lacks, aside from the camera protrusions.</p><p>Everything else, such as button placements, remains relatively the same in those leaks.</p><p>A more recent whispering from November claims that the S26 Ultra may <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s26-ultras-new-design-could-change-how-selfies-are-taken">change how users take selfies</a>. The selfie camera itself isn't rumored to change (big surprise), but what is potentially changing is the size of the lens cutout. Rumors claim the size could increase to 4mm, meaning users could have a slightly wider FOV (field of view) for their selfies.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This 11-inch TCL tablet is equipped with the latest-generation NXTPAPER 4.0 tech, and it's still somehow <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FLJMFNR7"><strong>$130 off</strong></a> even after Black Friday ended. Not only that, but the $239 price includes the tablet, a folio case, AND a stylus that's perfect for writing or note-taking. It's everything you need for an outrageously low price! If you're looking for Black Friday tablet deals, this is the best answer.</p><p>The tablet itself normally retails for $249, so you know you're getting a really good deal at $239 when it comes with that case and stylus. The tablet itself is no slouch either, and I covered the merits of its display in my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/tcl-nxtpaper-4-fixes-one-of-the-technologys-biggest-hidden-issues">TCL NXTPAPER 11 Plus display review</a> back in July. It was a great way to introduce the latest NXTPAPER 4.0 tech to the world, and it continues to be an excellent budget-friendly tablet that doesn't feel slow or lacking.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="fa3556e2-3dda-4763-a8e7-a20e8f40fae5" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Price comparison: Walmart - $224 (no case or stylus included)" data-dimension48="Price comparison: Walmart - $224 (no case or stylus included)" data-dimension25="$239.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FLJMFNR7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="zcr4Z8qwujAeqMm5gfzGGn" name="tcl-nxtpaper-11-plus-official-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zcr4Z8qwujAeqMm5gfzGGn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="1600" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>The TCL NXTPAPER 11 Plus tablet is equipped with a next-generation 120Hz NXTPAPER 4.0 display, 8GB RAM, 8000mAh battery, 256GB storage, <strong>and even comes with a case and a stylus</strong>, all for just $239.99 after Black Friday!</p><p><strong>Price comparison: </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/TCL-NXTPAPER-11-Plus/14687819013" data-dimension112="fa3556e2-3dda-4763-a8e7-a20e8f40fae5" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Price comparison: Walmart - $224 (no case or stylus included)" data-dimension48="Price comparison: Walmart - $224 (no case or stylus included)" data-dimension25="$239.99">Walmart - $224 (no case or stylus included)</a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FLJMFNR7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="fa3556e2-3dda-4763-a8e7-a20e8f40fae5" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Price comparison: Walmart - $224 (no case or stylus included)" data-dimension48="Price comparison: Walmart - $224 (no case or stylus included)" data-dimension25="$239.99">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You love to read a mix of books, manga, graphic novels, or other content, enjoy watching movies and TV shows on the go, or just need a tablet that feels great to write and draw on and won't bleed your eyes dry with a flickering display like Samsung tablets will.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You like to read outdoors. The NXTPAPER 4.0 display does a lot of things well, but outdoor visibility is not one of them.</p><p>I use the TCL NXTPAPER 11 Plus as a way to read manga on the Shonen Jump service, which somehow only costs $3.99 per month and gives unlimited access to a bajillion popular manga series. Color pages look stunning on this display, and the anti-glare matte screen ensures this feels more like a physical book than a shiny OLED does.</p><p>Outside of that, it's really great for just about anything. Android 15 offers great multitasking capabilities, and the included stylus make this paperlike display perfect for writing, taking notes, drawing, or anything else you might want to use a stylus for. Games with amazing art, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=unity.Annapurna.Gorogoa">Gorogoa</a>, are also perfect on the display, making it feel like a painted canvas come to life.</p><p>While you're on the Amazon page, you'll also notice a "TCL NXTPAPER 11 Gen 2" tablet that's even cheaper, but I wouldn't recommend that model over this one because of the sub-par processor.</p><h2 id="black-friday-2025-quick-links-47">Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More post-Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

From the screen recording, the user is seen on the Instagram homepage and then swiping it away, returning to their home screen. However, when trying to open another app, X (formerly Twitter), in this instance, Instagram returns.</p><p>The user explains that they've had this problem "for like six months." They add that they've been unable to prove that they weren't crazy until now with this recording.</p><p>Others were quick to join the Reddit discussion, stating they've also been experiencing this problem on Google's Pixel. One user states they've encountered this issue on their Pixel 8 Pro, as well as their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-hands-on">Pixel 10 Pro XL</a>. This creates an interesting dynamic, as this could be quite a persistent software issue with Google's Pixels.</p><p>Nevertheless, one user claims that the only workaround to this is to "stop for a second, then choose your app or go to the taskbar and then go back to home and then choose the app." While not the fix users are looking for, perhaps this will offer some relief. To make matters more frustrating, the publication clocked some official Google acknowledgement of this issue following user reports through its channels.</p><p>However, per the post, Google has been silent ever since, offering no concrete fixes for the affected devices.</p><h2 id="the-issues-roll-on-2">The issues roll on</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="qqQRMq7YLGyAHU3bGdoCMA" name="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL photos on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qqQRMq7YLGyAHU3bGdoCMA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google's Pixels have been through it, and the most recent issue plagues the Pixel 10 following the company's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/pixel-10-users-face-wi-fi-troubles-airdrop-quick-share-update">AirDrop-Quick Share update</a>.

Users have continued to report that the speakerphone button in the Phone app often becomes "unresponsive" or "laggy." While this has been going on, even more Pixel 9 phones in May, Google hasn't fixed it, and it probably never will. Recently, it was reported that the company marked the issue as "won't fix (Infeasible)" due to "not enough actionable information."</p> ]]></dc:content>

In short, this unique display technology comes with an anti-reflective, matte layer applied on top of a diffused layer, giving the display a unique "paperlike" appearance.</p><p>A handy switch on the side allows you to toggle between full color, a selection of "inky" colors that's good for comic or manga reading, or a full black & white digital detox mode.

This phone will do all the basics and more, but it's not a high-end experience.</p><p>As this is a $169 phone, you shouldn't expect flagship performance or a phone that's going to play graphically-intensive games very well. But if you don't care about that, the TCL 60 XE NXTPAPER is a phenomenal choice for everyday use. Android Central's Managing Editor, Derrek Lee, agrees and said as much <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tcl/tcl-60-xe-nxtpaper-review">in our review</a>.</p><p>"While not a flagship by any means, the TCL 60 XE NXTPAPER does stand out from the pack, thanks to the more eye-friendly display that can effectively transform the phone into an e-reader with the flip of a switch. I like to think of it as having a Boox Palma living inside your smartphone, which should appeal to anyone who likes to read but doesn’t want to carry a separate e-reader with them at all times."</p><p>And since this runs a modern version of Android, you can add any of your favorite Google Play apps to it, including eBook apps like Kindle, Kobo, Play Books, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/libby-library-app-for-e-readers">the Libby library app</a>, and plenty more. And, unlike an E Ink e-reader, this one still looks good if you happen to want to watch a movie or TV show on it, too!</p><h2 id="black-friday-2025-quick-links-52">Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More post-Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The publication cites Weibo leaker, Digital Chat Station (DCS), who highlighted the apparent publishing of charging information for the device in question. According to the 3C certification listing, the phone could debut with 120W charging, which likely refers to its wired option.</p><p>Moreover, the leaker spotted that the alleged Magic 8 Ultra was listed with satellite connectivity support.</p><p>It seems Honor is looking to integrate Tiantong Satellite capabilities within the 8 Ultra, technology that we've seen implemented across other Chinese OEMs before. Additional rumors were mentioned, as the post also taps another Weibo leaker, Smart Pikachu. This social media post alleges that Honor's doing a little more with the Ultra variant by upgrading the phone's "materials." Honor is also rumored to begin focusing on the Ultra's photography with a "new imaging system" and main camera.</p><p>The tipsters didn't mention a potential launch date, but it is expected (per DCS) that a price hike could come for the Ultra variant.</p><h2 id="where-we-might-go-2">Where we might go</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5DJ2dGcN8xPkq78sumyjtK" name="honor-magic-8-pro-hands-on-magic-os-10" alt="The Magic OS 10 update screen on an Honor Magic 8 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5DJ2dGcN8xPkq78sumyjtK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Honor's Magic 8 series <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-magic-8-series-debut-redefines-on-device-ai-imaging-on-device-needs">was just launched in October</a>, and with it came a Magic 8 and a Magic 8 Pro. The OEM put quite a spotlight on the Pro model, as it highlighted its work to further merge the human and machine experience with the handheld. The entire series; however, sports the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 SoC, which brings speed and the appropriate support for its YOYO AI software.</p><p>The Magic 8 Pro already features the new Magic Color engine for more "professional" like film coloring for user photos. This is taken further with its 50MP primary lens with OIS (optical image stabilization), a 50MP ultra-wide lens, and a 200MP telephoto lens. The rumors are suggesting a "main camera upgrade" for the Magic 8 Ultra, though it remains to be seen what that means.</p><p>We're either in for an MP change or, perhaps, there's something software/hardware coming under the hood.</p><p>More importantly, in China, the Magic 8 Pro started at what would be ~$798. A rumored price increase for the Ultra could push us closer to ~$1,000.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Both of these laptops come with a pretty hefty price tag, to be sure, but the regular model is a little cheaper and looks extra appealing at the current price point.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/samsungs-new-galaxy-book-5-lineup-boasts-ai-smarts-and-cross-device-connectivity">Samsung launched the Galaxy Book 5 lineup</a> this year, featuring a rotating 360-degree screen that's perfect for use as a traditional laptop or as a tablet. It also includes a vibrant 15.6-inch AMOLED display, a capable CPU, and a wide range of Samsung's latest Galaxy AI features such as AI Select, Photo Remaster, and more. Meanwhile, the laptop also comes with 512GB of storage as standard, up to 31 hours of battery life per charge, and a lightweight design that makes it easy to transport. Samsung says it can charge up to 39% in just 30 minutes, It's also compatible with other Galaxy devices, easily letting users add an additional screen with their Samsung tablets or phones.</p><p>It's worth noting that the discounted price tag will still cost buyers a pretty penny, but if you were already considering spending around $1,000 on a premium laptop, this might be a good opportunity to pick this one up.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,349.99" data-dimension48="$1,349.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Computer-Touchscreen-Speakers-NP750QHA-KA1US/dp/B0DSLNMY6M" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="4KdivJcVstBJEQC52oJmiK" name="Samsung-Mobile-Galaxy-Book5-Pro-360-screen.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4KdivJcVstBJEQC52oJmiK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4500" height="3000" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung 15.6-inch Galaxy Book 5 360:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Computer-Touchscreen-Speakers-NP750QHA-KA1US/dp/B0DSLNMY6M" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,349.99" data-dimension48="$1,349.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$1,349.99</del> <strong>$949.99 for Amazon's early Black Friday deals</strong></a></p><p>One of our favorite Samsung convertible laptops is currently just $1,000 at Amazon for the retailer's early Black Friday sale, representing a 26% discount on what is normally a fairly pricey device.

Despite featuring the 360-degree display hinge, it's fairly durable and weighs just about 3 pounds, making it perfect for those on the go.</p><p>The laptop also includes two Thunderbolt 4 ports, a USB-A port, a microSD port for expandable storage, and an HDMI port.

The upcoming OnePlus Ace 6T, expected to be called the OnePlus 15R in other markets, looks like it will be the company’s new battery life champion.</p><p>The Chinese variant has been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/7582893032/QfTsl1bbH" target="_blank">confirmed</a> to pack an 8,300mAh cell, the largest ever on a OnePlus smartphone (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-15r-ace-6t-battery-3620412/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>). This makes sense given how people use their phones now. With more gaming, video streaming, and multitasking, battery life is more important than ever, and OnePlus is clearly trying to address that.</p><p>The Ace 6T pairs its large battery with 100W fast charging, offsetting slow top-ups typical of ultra-large cells. This approach challenges competitors who stick to smaller batteries and conservative charging speeds.</p><h2 id="flagship-durability-2">Flagship durability</h2><p>While the battery grabs most of the headlines, the rest of the phone is impressive too. The 15R offers a surprisingly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-confirms-us-launch-for-15r-unveils-first-stylus-for-budget-tablet-line">robust set of durability ratings</a>, including IP66, IP68, IP69, and even IP69K. It’s rare to see this level of toughness in a phone focused on performance, showing that OnePlus wants this device to be more than just long-lasting.</p><p>The OnePlus 15R is also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15r-launch-date-confirmed">expected to run Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Gen 5</a>, giving it the same top-tier processing DNA as the upcoming OnePlus 15.</p><p>It’s still unclear if the global OnePlus 15R will have the same 8,000mAh-plus battery as the Chinese Ace 6T. So far, only the Chinese version is confirmed. Other details like the camera and screen resolution haven’t been revealed yet.</p><p>If the company sticks to this blueprint for the global variant, the 15R could easily become a go-to option for gamers, frequent travelers, and anyone who’s tired of rationing battery life halfway through their day.</p> ]]></dc:content>

A massive class action lawsuit just dropped, claiming the devices are basically broken.</p><p>The case simply states that the Google Nest Hub, Google Nest Hub Max, Google Nest Mini, and Google Nest Audio have become faulty and have otherwise "malfunctioned" over the years.</p><p>Some of the highlighted issues were that these devices no longer "respond to even basic verbal questions." Not only has the Q&A portion of these Nest devices failed over time, but the plaintiffs ( Lieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein, LLP, and Kaplan Gore, LLP) state "widespread complaints" have been reported from consumers who state that these devices do not "interpret or act on voice commands, returning irrelevant information, losing internet connectivity despite a stable WiFi connection, and failing to recognize registered user voices."</p><p>This is being framed by the plaintiffs as a "consumer case" to secure compensation for individuals who purchased these drastically deteriorated devices.</p><h2 id="oneplus-confirms-us-launch-for-15r-with-the-oneplus-pad-go-2-2">OnePlus confirms US launch for 15R, with the OnePlus Pad Go 2</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.79%;"><img id="4uHgpvBmYKPSR4s9k2nfcB" name="oneplus-15r-showcase-qualcomm.JPG" alt="OnePlus executive showcasing the OnePlus 15R" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v2/t:0,l:0,cw:4240,ch:2385,q:80/4uHgpvBmYKPSR4s9k2nfcB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2832" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm / OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-confirms-us-launch-for-15r-unveils-first-stylus-for-budget-tablet-line"><strong>here</strong></a></p><p>OnePlus officially announced that it will be ending the year with another product drop. This time, it's bringing two budget devices to the U.S. and Canada — the OnePlus 15R and the OnePlus Pad Go 2 ( a tablet with a stylus)</p><p>The OnePlus 15R is being positioned as a “value flagship” in the U.S. and Canada markets. The initial specs point to a Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 chip, up to 16GB of RAM, 1 TB storage, and a dual-lens camera setup (50 MP + 8 MP) similar to the Chinese OnePlus Ace 6 model.</p><p>The phone will likely show up with a redesigned body,  consisting of a flat metal mid-frame and a camera module rotated exactly 45 degrees off the top-left corner. More importantly, the phone carries a stack of durability ratings you rarely see on a midrange device: IP66, IP68, IP69, and IP69K.

Vats hops in, claiming that others have said similar things, and that this could be the case for "Phase 1."</p><p>One UI 8.5 Beta 1, is expected to be followed by Beta 2, which the tipster suggests could start two weeks later, on December 22.

I used several of the brand's power banks over the years, and the EnerGeek GX11 easily stands out — this is the smallest 20,000mAh power bank I used, and the size alone was enough to convince me to take it with me on a recent visit to Bali, Indonesia.

The GX11 is the smallest 20,000mAh power bank I used, and I have all the latest Anker and UGREEN models on hand. The sizing alone is an achievement, but you also get global 4G connectivity, and a built-in USB-C cable.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You want the ability to change the bundled SIM card. To get more than 1GB data, you'll need to buy plans via Baseus, and they're costlier than your average travel eSIM provider.</p><p>I don't know how Baseus managed to cram a 20,000mAh battery into a power bank this small, but the sizing is a big differentiator. It's just great to be able to have access to this kind of power in such a small size, and you get 67W USB PD charging, making it convenient to charge phones and any other accessories — there are two USB-C ports and a USB-A port.</p><p>There's also a built-in USB-C cable that doubles as a lanyard, and while it isn't a retractable cable, it didn't prove to be an issue. The power bank did a great job charging my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi/poco-f8-ultra-review">POCO F8 Ultra</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/oppo-find-x9-pro-review">Find X9 Pro</a>, and I didn't have any issues in this area.

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I didn't see the point of photo frames, and I used my Nest Hub for a few years. But that changed when I got the Pexar; this is a 11-inch digital photo frame made by Lexar, and it is nothing short of incredible. It has a 11-inch anti-glare panel with 2K resolution, and the quality of the screen is better than any other photo frame I used.</p><p>It's also extremely easy to set up and use, and you can easily share photos from your phone, or transfer photos to the built-in 32GB internal storage. The best part is the discount; it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/pexar-Resolution-Ultimate-Anti-Glare-Stunning/dp/B0DB1BM71Q">now available for $139</a>, a $30 discount.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="869c84c2-4e63-43e1-b4a4-330f186d5478" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Pexar Starlight that costs $297" data-dimension48="Pexar Starlight that costs $297" data-dimension25="$139.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/pexar-Resolution-Ultimate-Anti-Glare-Stunning/dp/B0DB1BM71Q" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1102px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:71.14%;"><img id="a78DAtqGCKq46GPFTR9fpF" name="Pexar by Lexar" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a78DAtqGCKq46GPFTR9fpF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1102" height="784" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>Pexar's digital frame stands out for two reasons: it's easy to set up, and you can effortlessly share photos to the device. Then there's the panel: with a 2K resolution and anti-glare tech, it does a great job highlighting your family images. </p><p>This is the 11-inch size, and if you need a bigger photo frame, Lexar has the 15.6-inch <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Starlight-Digital-Stunning-Anti-Glare-Touchscreen/dp/B0FP4QDBZ9" data-dimension112="869c84c2-4e63-43e1-b4a4-330f186d5478" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Pexar Starlight that costs $297" data-dimension48="Pexar Starlight that costs $297" data-dimension25="$139.99">Pexar Starlight that costs $297</a>. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/pexar-Resolution-Ultimate-Anti-Glare-Stunning/dp/B0DB1BM71Q" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="869c84c2-4e63-43e1-b4a4-330f186d5478" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Pexar Starlight that costs $297" data-dimension48="Pexar Starlight that costs $297" data-dimension25="$139.99">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You need a high-quality photo frame that's easy to use. The anti-glare panel is the star of the show, and the high resolution combined with a matte texture make it the ideal showcase for your family photos.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You need a bigger size. Lexar now makes the 15.6-inch Pexar Starlight, and it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Starlight-Digital-Stunning-Anti-Glare-Touchscreen/dp/B0FP4QDBZ9">available for $297</a>. I've been using both models, and honestly, the Starlight is the one you should get if you don't mind the bigger size.</p><p>I've been using the 11-inch Pexar digital photo frame for just over six months, and it has been delightful. The key standout feature of this frame is undoubtedly the 11-inch panel with a 2K (2000 x 1200) resolution. The higher resolution makes your photos shine, and the anti-glare coating on the panel means you don't get any reflections even with plenty of ambient light. I have the frame mounted on a showcase in the living room, and the anti-glare tech really makes a huge difference.</p><p>Another big selling point is just intuitive it is to get photos onto the frame; it uses the Frameo platform, and you can just connect to your phone and share images that way. Or if you want to just transfer photos to the frame, it has a built-in 32GB storage, and you can use an SD card or USB-A flash drive to plug into the frame.</p><p>The photo frame connects over Wi-Fi, and is available in two colors: black and tan. I use the black model as that doesn't shift focus to the design itself. There are other niceties, including auto rotation, a clock, and weather info for your location. On the whole, the Pexar is no doubt the best photo frame I used, and if you need a good holiday gift, this is the one to get — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/pexar-Resolution-Ultimate-Anti-Glare-Stunning/dp/B0DB1BM71Q">particularly with a discount to $139</a>.</p><p>I recently got started with the bigger model, the 15.6-inch Pexar Starlight. It has a bold design and comes with a wall light, and the panel quality is just as good, and it gets double the storage at 64GB. It is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Starlight-Digital-Stunning-Anti-Glare-Touchscreen/dp/B0FP4QDBZ9">costlier at $297</a>, but if you need a bigger photo frame, it is the obvious recommendation.</p> ]]></dc:content>

While the latest hall effect keyboards are pretty great and use magnetic switches to good effect, my favorite keyboard continues to be the Q1 Pro. There's a good reason for this — it's absolutely fantastic. It has a gasket-mounted design that has excellent feedback, and the bounciness along with the acoustics that you get are unmatched by any other Keychron product.</p><p>The best part is that the Q1 Pro is finally discounted; if you follow the keyboard category, you know that these things don't usually go on sale, so it's a big deal that you can now <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Keychron-Mechanical-Programmable-Hot-swappable-Compatible/dp/B0BKGNVK98">get the Q1 Pro for $146 on Amazon</a>. This variant has Keychron's K Pro Banana mechanical switch, and it's an absolute joy to use. If you want a gaming keyboard with the latest magnetic switches, the Q1 HE has the same design and features, and it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://amazon.com/Keychron-Mechanical-Double-Rail-Compatible-Hot-swappable/dp/B0D4YKXSPD">available for $191 now</a>.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="75b19a3a-0dac-4777-9704-c957aeb6b683" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="The Q1 Pro has all the features you need in a high-end mechanical keyboard.

In that case, I'd suggest getting the Q6 Max. It has the same design and feature-set as the Q1 Pro, but you get a dedicated number pad, and it is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Keychron-Bluetooth-Mechanical-Programmable-Hot-Swappable/dp/B0CSXXGB7D">now down to $191</a>.</p><p>The Q1 Pro is built like a tank — seriously — and it weighs close to 4lb. It has 2.4GHz and Bluetooth connectivity in addition to the usual USB-C, and I routinely use it with my iPad Pro M4. It comes with the K Pro Banana switches, but you can always change these out as needed, and what I like the most about the keyboard is the unique bounciness — you'll need to use it to understand what I mean.</p><p>While the Q1 HE has newer magnetic switches that let you change the actuation — making a difference in gaming — it doesn't have the same feel to it. I still prefer the Q1 Pro in this area, and I now use it with Gateron's brilliant Ink Black VB2 switches, and the tactility combined with the bounciness of the keyboard is just a joy.</p><p>I know shelling out close to $150 on a keyboard is a lot, but unlike your phone, the Q1 Pro is designed to last over a decade. If you're ready to switch, I think the Q1 Pro is the one to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Keychron-Mechanical-Programmable-Hot-swappable-Compatible/dp/B0BKGNVK98">get this Black Friday at $146</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The Fenix 8 is Garmin's best available watch, but you can find <em>plenty</em> of excellent Garmin watches at much lower prices that offer 95% of the same software, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Forerunner%C2%AE-Smartwatch-Flashlight-Translucent-Whitestone/dp/B0F8QZ7233"><strong>Forerunner 970 for $649 ($100 off)</strong></a>. Unless you're a dedicated diver, surfer, or water skier, the Forerunner 970 will give you the tools you need for $200 less, even if the deal is less impressive on paper.</p><p>And even that might be too expensive for you! The question is, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-black-friday-garmin-deals-2025">Garmin watch Black Friday deal</a> should you get?</p><h2 id="why-i-recommend-other-garmin-watches-before-the-fenix-8-2">Why I recommend other Garmin watches before the Fenix 8</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="oUbG3VJHWr9MEx7yJFcUcJ" name="Garmin-Fenix-8-hike-activity" alt="A hiking activity showing elevation, distance, time, and direction on the Garmin Fenix 8" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oUbG3VJHWr9MEx7yJFcUcJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Fenix 8 came out in August 2024. After its launch, Fenix 7 Pro and Epix Pro (Gen 2) owners realized Garmin had stopped supporting its "last-gen" watches with new features, even though they'd paid close to a grand for them only a short time ago.</p><p>Since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-pro-vs-fenix-8">Fenix 8 Pro</a> launched this summer, we can assume Garmin will launch a Fenix 9 in summer 2026. Once it does, past history suggests Garmin will stop giving the Fenix 8 new features, upselling its most dedicated fans to the next generation. That also applies to other Garmin watches, but it's easier to accept 1–2 years of updates when you're paying half as much.</p><p>The Fenix 8 is absurdly packed with features for almost every sport out there. So ask yourself, how often will you use Garmin's most niche sports modes, or can you live with a cheaper model that you have to take off <em>once</em> while snorkeling on vacation, or might "only" last two weeks per charge instead of three or four?</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="6emUGV8DPb68ivhpHCJayP" name="Garmin-Venu-X1-vs-Forerunner-970-hike-activity" alt="The Garmin Venu X1 (left) and Garmin Forerunner 970 (right), both on one wrist, showing near-identical stats for a hike activity's distance, time, elevation gain, and compass direction." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6emUGV8DPb68ivhpHCJayP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I reviewed Forerunner, Instinct, and Venu watches before I ever tried on a Fenix. I grew to appreciate their strong battery life, lightweight designs, and core training features, without realizing the niche tools that I was missing. And when I upgraded to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-955-review">Forerunner 955</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">965</a> with top-class tools and battery, they only cost $499–599.</p><p>That's why I don't want people to overpay for the Fenix 8, just because I liked testing it after receiving a free review unit. Its impressiveness doesn't mean I'd actually buy it myself! There are several great alternatives that I'd suggest first:</p><p><strong>If you want long battery life, an AMOLED display, and advanced Fenix-class features:</strong> The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-970-review">Garmin Forerunner 970</a> is my first suggestion; if you want to spend even less, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/garmin-forerunner-965-gps-smartwatch-47-mm-fiber-reinforced-polymer-carbon-gray-tlc-titanium-2023/JXF9YF4C26/sku/6544443"><strong>Forerunner 965 is $449 ($150 off)</strong></a>, with 23-day battery life, the same dual-band GPS accuracy, and top-class features like offline maps, Endurance Score, real-time stamina, MTB Grit & Flow, and Strava Live Segments, though not the newest 970/ Fenix 8 tricks like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-forerunner-970-running-tolerance-tool-too-useful-to-be-premium-feature">running tolerance</a> and Strength Coach.</p><p><strong>If you want a more stylish titanium watch:</strong> The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/garmin-epix-pro-gen-2-sapphire-edition-47mm-fiber-reinforced-polymer-titanium-with-whitestone-band-2024/JXF9YF4LVF"><strong>Garmin Epix Pro (Gen 2) is $549 ($450 off)</strong></a>, with most of the same perks like fifth-gen health sensors, mic & speaker for calling, a flashlight for safety at night, and sapphire glass, paired with an impressive 16-day battery life and all of the same tricks as the Forerunner 965.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="bmHBn8FrjesbKiyv8DW2MC" name="Garmin-Venu-X1-maps" alt="The Garmin Venu X1 (left) and Garmin Forerunner 970 (right) sitting aside each other on a lawn, both showing the same 9-mile hiking course, but the larger, square-shaped X1 display shows much more map info." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bmHBn8FrjesbKiyv8DW2MC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>You want cutting-edge features and style, but not the extras for:</strong> The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Advanced-Smartwatch-Colorful-Flashlight/dp/B0FRG18TLS"><strong>Garmin Venu 4 is $499 ($50 off)</strong></a>, with essentials like daily workout suggestions, training load, Bluetooth calling, health outliers from your baseline stats, and dual-band GPS. Its AMOLED display is twice as bright as the Fenix 8's, and its two-button design blends in more than the Fenix 8's sporty five-button look, while weighing less.</p><p><strong>You want the same cutting-edge features in a much lighter design</strong>. The Fenix 8's weight takes some getting used to, unless you buy the smaller model that lasts ten days. So why not shed a couple more days and buy the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Lightweight-Smartwatch-Advanced-Features-ComfortFit/dp/B0FCYHNL3C"><strong>Venu X1 for $599 ($200 off)</strong></a>? It lasts eight days per charge, but in exchange, you get an absurdly light and skinny design that blends in for hours-long workouts, paired with a 2-inch display that's <em>much</em> better than a Fenix 8's for following maps.</p><p>Feel free to ignore my advice if you have the money for the Fenix 8 and don't want to worry about the compromises of my other suggestions, like cheaper-looking polymer cases, fewer software perks, and shorter battery life. But I honestly think you shouldn't let FOMO upsell you to the Fenix 8 when other Garmin watches give you close to the same experience for hundreds less.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-other-black-friday-deals"><span>Other Black Friday deals</span></h3><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

With phone prices going up next year, this is the best time to get a new phone while they're still relatively affordable, and there are decent deals to be had. The Pixel 9a is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Gemini-Smartphone-Incredible/dp/B0DVHTT1GS">now selling at just $349</a>, and honestly, it's a terrific choice if you just need a reliable phone. It nails the basics, has a great in-hand feel, and the rear design is pretty great thanks to a camera module that sits flush with the body. The cameras are the best in this category, you get a clean software with fast updates, and there isn't much missing on this phone.</p><p>If you've used a Samsung phone and are considering switching over to another manufacturer, I highly recommend the OnePlus 13, which is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Smartphone-Snapdragon-SUPERVOOC-Hasselblad/dp/B0DP8KZLQ3">now down to $699</a>. It's significantly more affordable than the Galaxy S25 models, but you still get amazing cameras, better battery life than any Samsung phone, and a level of fluidity that One UI can't come close to.</p><p>And if you're ready to embrace AI features and want a phone that does the best job in this area, you should get the Pixel 10 Pro XL. The phone usually costs $1,199, but Google has a $300 discount right now, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Pro-Smartphone-Fast-Charging/dp/B0FFTSKP7M/">bringing it down to $899</a>. That's still quite a lot of cash, but the Pixel 10 Pro XL is the best Google phone yet, and having used every single Pixel in the last decade, I'm confident in recommending the device.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The Legion Tab Gen 3 is an absolute beast, thanks to its flagship power in a compact form factor.

But now that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/black-friday">Black Friday</a> is in full swing, it turns out it wasn't a fluke; the Pixel 10 is back down to its lowest price this year, with a pretty <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FFTRPM4K/"><strong>impressive 25% discount</strong></a>.</p><p>To me, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-review">Google Pixel 10</a> felt appropriately priced at $800, but at 25% off, you're paying just $600 for a pretty fantastic phone. It's already one of the cheaper flagship AI phones you can buy, so a $200 discount just months after launch is a deal worth taking advantage of.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><em><strong>Amazon's Black Friday week is LIVE: see the full list of deals</strong></em></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="f0d62b99-288a-4180-b638-a3d9d48cb6c3" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Price check: $499 at Best Buy (with activation)" data-dimension48="Price check: $499 at Best Buy (with activation)" data-dimension25="$599" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FFTRPM4K/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="roHfB8CwZvHJScuZ8TL6Bf" name="Google Pixel 10" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/roHfB8CwZvHJScuZ8TL6Bf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>Don't dilly or dally on this Black Friday deal! A savings of $200 brings the Pixel 10 back down to its lowest price we've seen this year, with a deal that feels almost too good to be true. But we probably won't see this deal again for a while, so get it now while the Pixel 10 is still hot!</p><p><strong>Price check: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/google-pixel-10-128gb-unlocked-indigo/J39TC8JG4L" data-dimension112="f0d62b99-288a-4180-b638-a3d9d48cb6c3" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Price check: $499 at Best Buy (with activation)" data-dimension48="Price check: $499 at Best Buy (with activation)" data-dimension25="$599"><strong>$499 at Best Buy (with activation)</strong></a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FFTRPM4K/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="f0d62b99-288a-4180-b638-a3d9d48cb6c3" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Price check: $499 at Best Buy (with activation)" data-dimension48="Price check: $499 at Best Buy (with activation)" data-dimension25="$599">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You want a straightforward and easy-to-use Android phone with great cameras, good battery life, long software support, and magnetic charging.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You want a smartphone with a large display, fast charging, and more base storage in case 128GB isn't enough.</p><h2 id="pixel-ai-magic-for-less-2">Pixel AI magic for less</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wnKeFkSkeDhyXedBx4rGbF" name="Google-Pixel-10-review-37" alt="Gemini Live on the Pixel 10" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wnKeFkSkeDhyXedBx4rGbF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I've owned and reviewed several <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/best-google-pixel-phones">Pixel phones</a>, but the Pixel 10 feels like the final form of Google's base model phone. Not only does it come with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-tensor-g5">new Tensor chip</a> and larger battery, but it also gets features that finally help justify the $800 price tag (making the discount feel that much sweeter).</p><p>The addition of a third camera finally gives you incredible zoom detail with the 5x telephoto sensor. Plus, the new cameras capture images that feel much livelier than those from previous models, which I talk a bit more about in my Pixel 10 camera review.</p><p>Battery life also feels great, with the phone easily lasting all day. Google manages to be the first company to stick full <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-qi2-accessories">Qi2</a> compatibility on a flagship Android phone. This means you can use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phone-users">MagSafe accessories</a> with the Pixel 10 without needing a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/best-google-pixel-10-cases">case</a>, just like recent iPhones. It's incredibly convenient, especially when it comes to portable power banks, stands, storage devices, and more.</p><p>But of course, you can't talk about Pixel without mentioning the software and AI. Google takes its AI chops to the next level with a host of new and improved features, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/how-use-gemini-live-camera-screen-sharing">Gemini Live</a> and more. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-cue-on-the-pixel-10">Magic Cue</a> surfaces relevant on-device information for you based on conversations you're having or things you're doing, so you don't have to search for it. It's a huge time-saver and really showcases how AI can be actually useful.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/how-to-use-camera-coach">Camera Coach</a> is also a neat feature that can help you take the perfect photo by guiding you through the process. Just tell it what kind of photo you want to take and follow the steps. It works based on whatever scene is in the viewfinder, so it'll know just how to capture the moment.</p><p>And once you've ordered a Pixel 10, be sure to check out our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/bought-a-new-pixel-these-are-the-must-have-accessories-to-grab-before-black-friday-ends"><strong>Black Friday Pixel collection</strong></a> for the perfect accessories to pair with your new phone!</p><h2 id="black-friday-2025-quick-links-72">Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

For one, it's equipped with 3GB of RAM and 16GB of storage, which is more than you'll find on competing devices. There are also two built-in USB ports, which allows me to plug in my hard drive full of ROMs.</p><p>The power and flexibility surpasses almost every other streaming device I have, besides the Apple TV 4K that's tethered to the TV in my living room.

Are these major updates? Of course not, but I'll be damned if you can find any other streaming device that's still getting updates ten years after its release.</p><h2 id="black-friday-2025-quick-links-77">Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The opposite happened — CMF Headphone Pro blew me away with long battery life, solid sound quality, and impressive ANC (for the price). Considering the CMF Headphone Pro are cheap to begin with, I'm shocked to report that Amazon took <em>another</em> $20 off the sticker price this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/black-friday">Black Friday</a>.</p><p>If you're someone who is appealed by the price of premium wireless headphones these days, the CMF Headphone Pro is for you.

It has colorful glossy plastic and interchangeable ear cushions that let you create clever color combinations. There are a bunch of tactile buttons and ports for maximum versatility. You get a USB-C port, 3.5mm headphone jack, two buttons, a slider, and a roller. It's all designed to help you use your CMF Headphone Pro any way you want.</p><p>From a hardware perspective, there are two 40mm drivers with nickel-plated diaphragms powering the audio experience, and these go with a 15.6mm copper voice coil, precision bass duct, and dual-chamber design.

appreciate the LDAC support of up to 990 kbps, and getting a hi-res audio codec for only $79 is outstanding. The Hybrid Adaptive ANC is as good as you'll get at this price point, too. And the clear attention-grabber here is the CMF Headphone Pro's battery life, which lasts up to 100 hours with ANC off and a still-great 50 hours with ANC on.</p><p>Need a budget pair of over-ear headphones for Black Friday or an affordable holiday gift?

But even discounted, you still have to pay upward of $449 (Forerunner 965) or $649 (Forerunner 970) for the <em>best</em> software features, especially offline maps for trail running or hiking.</p><p>That's why, even though the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/COROS-PACE-Pro-Touchscreen-Navigation/dp/B0DK31TB7G"><strong>COROS PACE Pro at $299 ($50 off)</strong></a> isn't the biggest Black Friday deal, it's a great alternative because it started off "cheap" for the value it offers: 20 days of battery life, a 1.3-inch AMOLED display, dual-band GPS that worked quite accurately in my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-pace-pro-review">PACE Pro review</a>, and offline hiking and street maps that were updated to include street names and places of interest earlier this year.</p><p>The bigger Black Friday deal that'll tempt more people is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/garmin-forerunner-265-gps-smartwatch-46-mm-fiber-reinforced-polymer-black-2023/JXF9YF4J4X"><strong>Garmin Forerunner 265 at $299 ($150 off)</strong></a>, but if you compare them directly, the PACE Pro offers an extra week of battery life and about double the dual-band GPS tracking (31 vs. 14 hours), and its brighter display (1,500 vs. 1,000 nits) displays maps clearly while Garmin only gives the 265 breadcrumb navigation. They both offer essentials like training load, recovery recommendations, and personalized running regimens.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="1b837e3a-aae6-4855-86db-8e5e2d0075a3" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Android Central verdict:" data-dimension48="Android Central verdict:" data-dimension25="$299.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/COROS-PACE-Pro-Touchscreen-Navigation/dp/B0DK31TB7G" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="CCwXeCFxZHJWiDxw9vLByT" name="coros-pace-pro-black-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CCwXeCFxZHJWiDxw9vLByT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-review" data-dimension112="1b837e3a-aae6-4855-86db-8e5e2d0075a3" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Android Central verdict:" data-dimension48="Android Central verdict:" data-dimension25="$299.99"><strong>Android Central verdict: </strong>★★★★</a></p><p>I ranked the COROS PACE Pro as the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-running-watches">best mid-range running watch</a> available today, beating out alternatives from Garmin, Suunto, Polar, Amazfit, and others for both accuracy and value. </p><p>COROS gave the PACE Pro a speedy processor (for a fitness watch), so when using the topographic maps, zooming in/ out with the crown or swiping on the touchscreen is speedy and seamless.

But without offline maps, the Instinct series relies on breadcrumb navigation, which just isn't that helpful when you come to a confusing trailhead; the lighter PACE Pro lets you check which trail you're on and makes it easier to improvise if you decide to take a different route.</p><p>COROS dropped the PACE Pro price after launching the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros/i-tested-the-coros-pace-4-and-its-new-best-cheap-running-watch-of-2025">PACE 4</a>, which is a cheaper alternative...but only if you don't need maps. And the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-nomad-3-has-impressed-me-as-fun-garmin-instinct-3-rival">COROS NOMAD</a> is an intriguing hiking alternative with maps, if you prefer an MIP display, but it's not discounted for Black Friday.</p><p>While most people will buy the PACE Pro from Amazon, if you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://coros.com/pacepro">buy from COROS</a> directly, you'll get 25% off a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-heart-rate-monitor-review">COROS Heart Rate Monitor</a>, a comfortable armband with accurate data for people who don't trust smartwatches for HR data but don't want to wear a constricting chest strap. Just put both devices in your cart, and you'll see the $20 discount.</p><p>Again, this sneaky second deal isn't especially large, but that's only because the $79 COROS HRM is already affordable. And I genuinely recommend it, having worn it during my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/the-garmin-tech-i-used-and-ignored-to-train-for-garmin-tucson-marathon">recent Garmin marathon</a>, synced to my Garmin watch to give me faster results when my heart rate climbs or drops.</p><h2 id="more-black-friday-deals-quick-links-12">More Black Friday deals - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

I've been eying an smart home camera upgrade to go with my Nest Doorbell, and the third-gen Nest Cam Indoor checks all my boxes — and it's on sale for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/black-friday">Black Friday</a>. This camera only came out last month, and it's already $25 off for Black Friday, bringing the Nest Cam Indoor down to only $75.</p><p>It's such a good deal that I'm buying more than one Nest Cam Indoor at this price. If you're deep in the Google ecosystem with Pixel or Nest devices, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/gemini-for-home-is-here-new-nest-cameras-ai-home-speaker-debut">Nest Cam Indoor</a> is a great way to expand your smart home while improving security. Here's why Google's best indoor security camera is a can't-miss deal at 25% off.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="2da0513c-1c84-4875-b864-f016ed305e6e" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Best Buy - $74.99" data-dimension48="Best Buy - $74.99" data-dimension25="$74.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Nest-Cam-Indoor-Wired/dp/B0FN7GF1ZC/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="SBfHRevpHY5ftoK9bNDAvP" name="Nest-Cam-Indoor-3" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SBfHRevpHY5ftoK9bNDAvP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>Google's latest Nest Cam Indoor <em>finally</em> upgrades the camera's resolution to 2K, and fully supports the AI-based camera detection features offered with Gemini for Home. Plus, the design is very homey with Snow, Hazel, and Berry color options available. </p><p>Price comparison: <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/google-nest-cam-indoor-wired-3rd-gen-latest-model-2k-video-and-gemini-snow/J39TC8JG2V/sku/6642734" target="_blank" data-dimension112="2da0513c-1c84-4875-b864-f016ed305e6e" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Best Buy - $74.99" data-dimension48="Best Buy - $74.99" data-dimension25="$74.99">Best Buy - $74.99</a> | <a href="https://store.google.com/us/config/nest_cam_indoor_wired_3rd_gen?sku=GA09973-US" target="_blank">Google - $74.99</a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Nest-Cam-Indoor-Wired/dp/B0FN7GF1ZC/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="2da0513c-1c84-4875-b864-f016ed305e6e" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Best Buy - $74.99" data-dimension48="Best Buy - $74.99" data-dimension25="$74.99">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if:</strong> you need a Google-connected, in-home security camera; you want Gemini for Home camera and motion detection; you want hi-res video feeds and 24/7 recording.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you don't want to pay for a subscription for advanced features; you need a camera with end-to-end encryption.</p><h2 id="why-i-m-buying-a-bunch-of-google-s-nest-cam-indoor-security-cameras-2">Why I'm buying a bunch of Google's Nest Cam Indoor security cameras</h2><p>There's one thing I absolutely love about Google's Nest Cam Indoor, and it's the security camera's design. For an indoor camera, it's important that the design feels homey and blends into your kitchen, living room, or bedroom. Google gets this right with the Nest Cam Indoor — it's unassuming and blends in with Snow (white), Hazel (gray), and Berry (red). I went with the Berry model, as it'll look more like an accent piece than a scary security system in my home.</p><p>Then, you have the upgraded hardware. Nest Cameras formerly had a 1080p video-resolution limit, which paled in comparison to the swath of 2K and 4K models on the market. Now, the Nest Cam Indoor (3rd-gen) has a 2K resolution (2560x1440) and a 152-degree field of view.</p><p>There's also 6x digital zoom support for when you need to crop in close. You also get 30 FPS video recording and HDR2 support, ensuring your security footage is always crisp. And, a night vision feature means you can see clearly inside your home, even when it's dark.</p><p>Some might view the internet-connected nature and subscription model of Google's Nest cameras as a drawback, but I look at it as a feature. You can always pop in and look at your Nest Cam Indoor feed from anywhere using the Google Home app, completely free. Up to six hours of event recording is included, too. With a Google Home Standard or Premium subscription, you can get up to 24/7 video recording, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-home-app-update-improves-geminis-voice-assistant-and-simplifies-descriptions">plus Gemini descriptions and object detection</a>.</p><p>Overall, Google added everything you might want to the Nest Cam Indoor (3rd-gen). If you're looking to build out your Google ecosystem and home security setup this Black Friday, there's no better buy.</p><h2 id="black-friday-2025-quick-links-87">Black Friday 2025 — quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><em><strong>Black Friday Samsung Galaxy deals</strong></em></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><em><strong>Black Friday Google Pixel deals</strong></em></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><em><strong>Black Friday Motorola deals</strong></em></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

I can't think of a better way to describe it. We'll see one price on its 2025 watches and foldables, refresh the page, and see an even better price. Right now, with no trade-in necessary, you can get the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/watches/galaxy-watch8/buy/galaxy-watch8-40mm-graphite-wi-fi-bluetooth-sku-sm-l320ndaaxaa/"><strong>Galaxy Watch 8 for $199 ($150 off) on Samsung.com for Black Friday</strong></a>, with the same $150-off deal for the 44mm model ($229) or LTE upgrades ($249 or $279).</p><p>Tech companies usually charge a consistent price across their own sites and retailer sites, but the Galaxy Watch 8 is <strong>$249</strong> ($100 off) on Amazon and Best Buy. I assumed Samsung would have a better trade-in deal for your old watch, but you don't even <em>need</em> to send Samsung anything to get "$150 instant credit."</p><p>The only problem is that I <strong>can't guarantee you'll </strong><em><strong>see</strong></em><strong> this deal price</strong>. It was originally $249 for me, and I still see $249 if I look in an incognito window. It's the same with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-deal-official-2025">Galaxy Z Flip 7 deal</a>, which varies between $200 or $300 off, seemingly on a whim. My advice is to follow the link to Samsung.com, and if you don't see $150 off, try refreshing, or adding and removing a trade-in option, and see if this "exclusive for you" deal appears eventually.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="60a37060-7776-4628-9b03-d58e128c2aea" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Android Central verdict:" data-dimension48="Android Central verdict:" data-dimension25="$199.99" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/watches/galaxy-watch8/buy/galaxy-watch8-40mm-graphite-wi-fi-bluetooth-sku-sm-l320ndaaxaa/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="pNxS2G8Htu9DPyvetR6euN" name="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pNxS2G8Htu9DPyvetR6euN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-review" data-dimension112="60a37060-7776-4628-9b03-d58e128c2aea" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Android Central verdict:" data-dimension48="Android Central verdict:" data-dimension25="$199.99"><strong>Android Central verdict: </strong>★★★★½</a></p><p>The Galaxy Watch 8 is the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android smartwatch</a> of the year, and while the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4-review">Pixel Watch 4</a> is a tough rival, it's only $50 off for Black Friday, making the $199 Galaxy Watch 8 a much better deal.</p><p>What makes it so great, aside from the price? The polarizing squircle case has the upside of making it skinny and lightweight, perfect for sleep tracking or workouts, but it still has a rugged shock-proofing and sapphire glass. Samsung also gives its watches the best update guarantee of any Android watch brand, with four promised years of feature and security updates (Google only offers three), and the One UI 8 Watch software is seamless and efficient.</p><p>Other retailers: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Coaching-Tracking/dp/B0F7QD4HSD"><strong>Amazon</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/samsung-galaxy-watch8-aluminum-smartwatch-40mm-bt-silver-2025/JJGRF3X43F"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/watches/galaxy-watch8/buy/galaxy-watch8-40mm-graphite-wi-fi-bluetooth-sku-sm-l320ndaaxaa/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="60a37060-7776-4628-9b03-d58e128c2aea" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Android Central verdict:" data-dimension48="Android Central verdict:" data-dimension25="$199.99">View Deal</a></p></div><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1755px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="i7Niwr559v6v7hufGKQN3b" name="Samsung-Black-Friday-hidden-deal" alt="A screenshot of Samsung's website showing a Galaxy Watch 8 product page with a $199 price and "$150 instant credit" available." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/i7Niwr559v6v7hufGKQN3b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1755" height="987" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Proof that I'm not making this up </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you have a recent Galaxy Watch, you can cut the price as low as $99 with a trade-in; send Samsung your Watch 7 ($100 extra off) or Watch 6 ($75 extra) to cut the price absurdly low for a smartwatch that's only four months old! But as it is, the current $150 "instant credit" basically acts like a huge trade-in discount on its own, so you don't <em>need</em> to make the trip to the post office if you don't want to.</p><p>Your alternative is to buy the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a>, which is only <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/samsung-galaxy-watch7-aluminum-smartwatch-40mm-bt-cream-2024/J3ZYG2KQ89"><strong>$129 at Best Buy</strong></a>. That, too, is an all-time low for an excellent Wear OS watch, and if you compare the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-vs-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 8 vs. 7</a>, they're virtually identical for performance, storage, battery life, and other specs.</p><p>But I'd recommend buying the Galaxy Watch 8, <em>if</em> you can snag it at that $199 price. Aside from giving you an extra year of support through 2029 and better trade-in value down the line, the display is slightly larger (1.34- vs. 1.3-inch) and brighter (3k vs. 2k nits), and our reviewer insisted that the squircle design will grow on you, even if you're used to circular smartwatches. Plus, the new, exclusive Samsung Health tricks like Vascular Load and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-tested-samsung-galaxy-watch-8-antioxidant-index-and-raised-score">Antioxidant Index</a> are nice perks to have.</p><h2 id="more-black-friday-deals-quick-links-17">More Black Friday deals - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>
