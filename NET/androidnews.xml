The Meta Quest 3S is already a value-focused VR headset, but the inclusion of a pre-installed Elite Strap (a $70 value), an Xbox controller (a $65 value), and 3 months of Gamepass Ultimate (a $60 value). That's <strong>$95 worth of stuff you're getting for free</strong>, plus the fact that there's no other way to get this black-and-green-themed bundle.</p><p>The Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition can play all the latest Quest 3-exclusive games like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/batman-arkham-shadow-review">Batman Arkham Shadow</a>, plus all the VR classics like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/assassins-creed-nexus-vr-review">Assassin's Creed Nexus</a> and Beat Saber. In addition, you get access to a giant, resizable virtual screen to play regular Xbox games on anywhere you're sitting, whether that's in your living room or on a plane.</p><p>While the Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition won't hook up to the Xbox in your living room — like a PlayStation VR2 hooks up to a PS5 — it's totally wireless and can play Xbox games so long as you have Gamepass and internet access.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="AaW5gmbysM6HcZMaMoTTbM" name="meta-quest-3s-xbox-edition-official-lifestyle-minecraft-dungeons" alt="An official lifestyle image of someone playing Minecraft Dungeons using a Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition headset" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AaW5gmbysM6HcZMaMoTTbM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1536" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Microsoft / Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The big draw of using a Meta Quest 3S for Game Pass is that you get a completely personal screen to play on that can be moved anywhere you want. That eliminates neck fatigue brought on by holding a handheld console for a long time, and it also means that you don't need to hog up the TV to play the games you want. It also means you can play those mature Xbox games in the same room your kids are watching Baby Shark without them seeing you tear up demons in Doom.</p><p>It's a similar experience to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">best Smart glasses</a>, but having a headset on means you get a much wider field of view and also get the option to play <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/one-year-later-mixed-reality-games-are-booming">mixed reality games</a> or even fully immersive VR games when you want.</p><p>If you want to learn more, check out our sister site Windows Central's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/meta-quest-3s-xbox-edition-hands-on-review">Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition hands-on</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

And to celebrate its 20th birthday, Google Earth is rolling out a nostalgic update: historical Street View, now baked right into the Earth experience.</p><p>What started as a 3D map app is now a massive time machine in your pocket, full of satellite snapshots, rare discoveries, and even Hollywood-worthy reunions. With its latest update, you can now hop into Street View and roll back the clock to see how your city or street looked a decade or two ago.</p><p>This feature even got social media buzzing recently with #somewhereonGoogleMaps as people <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps-earth-street-view-expands-ai">virtually time-traveled to see how places evolved</a> and find their loved ones in imagery.</p><h2 id="from-fun-to-life-changing-2">From fun to life-changing</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2496px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:63.86%;"><img id="HCQV5nDPNUzxJJ387LqD3E" name="Google-Earth-overhead-image" alt="Overhead image from Google Earth" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HCQV5nDPNUzxJJ387LqD3E.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2496" height="1594" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Beyond the fun of virtual tourism, Google Earth has racked up some pretty impressive milestones. Back in 2005, it was downloaded 100 million times in its first week. When Hurricane Katrina hit just months later, first responders used updated satellite views from Google Earth to coordinate disaster response.</p><p>Over the years, Google Earth has quietly helped discover coral reefs, ancient human relatives, and even long-lost family members. In 2016, Saroo Brierley used Earth imagery to retrace his childhood journey and reconnect with his birth mother in India—25 years later. That story turned into the Oscar-nominated film Lion.</p><p>In 2012, Google ditched the satellites and flew a little closer to Earth—literally. It used helium balloons and kites to snap aerial photos over Oakland, California, kicking off the era of community-captured imagery. Fast forward to today, and you’ve got professionals using Google Earth to evaluate solar panel viability and building designs before even setting foot onsite.</p><h2 id="ai-for-the-planet-2">AI for the planet</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:51.44%;"><img id="srSPLq4XbNfVVzKqSeXwrj" name="Houston-3D-image-Google-Earth" alt="3D image on Google Earth showing parts of Houston" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/srSPLq4XbNfVVzKqSeXwrj.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="823" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Beyond letting everyday folks geek out on geography, Google Earth is giving us AI-powered insights.

With this upgrade, you’ll be able to see which neighborhoods are naturally cooler thanks to more shade. That kind of insight makes it way easier to figure out where to plant more trees or roll out heat-busting fixes.

To get the most out of your device, you need the right charging equipment.</p><p>I bought a USB-C cable with a screen from a random, no-name brand three years ago, mostly expecting it to be a gimmick. After all, I paid less than $10 for it, and had almost zero faith it would do what it claimed to. Fast forward to 2025, and the cheap cable I bought with a screen in 2022 is still working, and has been a game-changer for my charging habits. Here's why this cable changed my mind, and why you should get one too.</p><h2 id="a-basic-led-on-a-usb-c-cable-isn-t-overdoing-it-2">A basic LED on a USB-C cable isn't overdoing it</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="q4zWRThovvkU45jF7kP4GR" name="SooPii-USBC-Cable-1" alt="A SooPii USB-C cable connected to a power bank and a MacBook Air." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/q4zWRThovvkU45jF7kP4GR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Charging speed is arguably more important than battery life. Yes, having a long-lasting phone, tablet, or laptop is great, but it can be even better when a device supports fast charging. Some phones, like OnePlus devices in China, support impressive 100W charging speeds — or better. Even the latest iPhones, Google Pixel phones, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Samsung Galaxy phones</a> can do better than the 5W or 10W speeds of old.</p><p>The problem is, you won't get those handy top speeds by using any old power source and cable. Often, the cables included in the box with your device won't even cut it — you might need a USB-C cable or power adapter that supports faster speeds. Without a USB-C cable with a screen, you can't really tell which part of the charging system is the root of the issue.</p><p>That's why I exclusively carry <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Braided-Charging-Display-MacBook-Samsung/dp/B09HC4K3KP/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">this USB-C cable from SooPii. </a>It has a tiny, LED screen that shows the exact wattage your device is accepting from a power source. With it, I can figure out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/summer-travel-guide-2025-charging-accessories">which wall plugs or power banks</a> are actually giving my devices enough power. I use compact Anker Nano power adapters for charging my phone and earbuds, for instance, and save higher-wattage <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-anker-power-banks">Anker</a> and UGREEN adapters for tablets and laptops.</p><p>Some included wall plugs simply get disposed of because they aren't capable of delivering enough power. Without a USB-C cable with a display, I was flying blind, not knowing which power adapters or devices were charging funky. Now I have a bit more insight, and I didn't have to pay a premium for it — this cable has been consistently priced at around $8 and has lasted me years.</p><p>If you're in the market for a USB-C cable upgrade, don't scoff at ones with an LED screen. I thought it was a gimmick at first, but they quickly won me over.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="98aaa69d-ffbb-4571-ab92-c3e83cbd5b47">            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Braided-Charging-Display-MacBook-Samsung/dp/B09HC4K3KP" data-model-name="SooPii 100W USB-C cable"><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UMTpf4C3oqj6vbFwNZ3vbb.jpg' alt="A black SooPii USB-C cable with an LED against a white background."></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">SooPii 100W USB-C cable</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>An essential charging cable</strong></em></p><p>At under $10, getting a USB-C charging cable with an LED screen and 100W power delivery is impressive.

Notably, changes are coming to the Google AI Pro subscription.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="sAT77wL9JYXf3YTaFQK79o" name="lenovo-chromebook-plus-14-hands-on-4" alt="Chromebook Plus with Gemini features with Google AI Pro plan" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sAT77wL9JYXf3YTaFQK79o.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You still get 2TB of cloud storage, along with Gemini access in your favorite Google services.

The retractable USB-C cable means you don't have to dig around in your bag to locate a cable, and it does an effective job charging devices at up to 67W.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You want more than two USB-C charging ports.</p><p>I used all the power banks Baseus released until now, and the Enercore shares a similar design with reliable build quality. The blue design is a little more distinctive than the gunmetal grey that's standard on most power banks, and while it picks up smudges, it isn't too glossy.</p><p>There's a built-in panel that shows remaining battery level, and the main attraction is the retractable USB-C cable that's tucked into the top of the Enercore. It doesn't stick out, and the USB-C connector has a magnet that ensures it stays attached to the chassis when you don't need the cable.</p><p>The cable goes up to 2.3 feet when fully extended, and it has four different lengths, so if you've got your phone next to the power bank, you don't need to extend it all the way. The flat cable has a tangle-free design, and it has been reliable in the week I used it — I tested it with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">9 Pro XL</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x200-ultra-review">Vivo X200 Ultra</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">X200 Pro</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review">Honor Magic V3</a>.</p><p>The retractable cable delivers up to a 67W charge over the USB PD protocol, and it has the standard power profiles: 5V/3A (15W), 9V/3A (27W), 12V/3A (36W), 15V/3A (45W), and 20V/3.35A (67W). The 20,000mAh battery ensures you can easily charge phones twice, and it delivers an efficiency of just over 60% — a decent showing in this category.</p><p>In addition to the retractable cable, you get a standard USB-C slot that can be used to charge a secondary device at up to 45W. This ports acts as the input, so you'll have to plug in a cable to charge the internal 20,000mAh battery. I didn't see any issues with overheating or charging various phones and accessories, and the Enercore has been just as reliable as its immediate rivals.</p><p>It is a decent recommendation at $59, but with the deal <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Baseus-Enercore-20000mAh-Retractable-Essential/dp/B0F3X1DLTD">bringing the price down to $44</a>, there's just no reason not to pick it up if you're interested in a new power bank.</p> ]]></dc:content>

But it’s not just shedding size—it's also rumored to be getting a durability upgrade, with better protection against both dust and water than the last model or any other foldables out there.</p><p>Following up on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>, the next-gen model might hit a big milestone—an IP68 rating, if a new report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-hinge" target="_blank">Android Headlines</a> is to be believed. If true, it’d be the first foldable to fully lock out dust and survive a splash, which is a pretty major first.</p><p>For anyone curious, IP ratings break down like this: the first number tells you how dustproof a device is, and the second one covers water resistance.</p><h2 id="foldables-dirty-little-secret-2">Foldables’ dirty little secret</h2><p>Most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">fan-favorite foldables</a> so far—like the Pixel 9 Pro Fold—only had IPX8, which means they’re good with water but not officially dustproof.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3vdxMY2tqLQZFRre938Rw4" name="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review-4.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold on fence railing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3vdxMY2tqLQZFRre938Rw4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Right now, Samsung holds the durability crown in the foldable segment, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> rocking IP48 ratings. But with the Galaxy Z Fold 7 aiming for IP68 and launching in July, Samsung could beat Google to the punch, since the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is tipped to land in August.</p><p>Durability isn’t the only upgrade on deck. Google’s also reworking the hinge on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold. That tweak should shrink the bezel around it and make room for a slightly bigger outer screen (6.4 inches vs. 6.3). The result is a slimmer build that not only feels better in your hand but also puts it right in the ring with Samsung’s Fold 7.</p><p>Google doesn’t seem obsessed with making the thinnest foldable, but the Pixel 10 Pro Fold should still be noticeably trimmer than last year’s model, and tougher at that. So even if it’s not breaking records, it’s shaping up to be a solid step forward.</p> ]]></dc:content>

While the chip's NPU can run up to "59 trillion operations per second (TOPS)," a noted 39% boost over <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-exynos-2400-comeback">the 2400</a> regarding AI, a big step arrives for its CPU. According to Samsung, the Exynos 2500's CPU features a 10-core structure (1+7+2).</p><p>The Korean OEM attributes its 15% boost in big core performance capabilities to the use of the "ultra-modern" Arm Cortex-X925 core.</p><p>Thanks to this, Samsung says the Exynos 2500 is capable of running "heavier apps" simultaneously without worry (and likely without causing too much strain on the phone). Graphics are important, especially when you're looking for a good flagship phone for mobile gaming. Samsung says it utilizes the fourth-generation Xclipse 950 GPU with the latest Exynos SoC.</p><p>It's also partnered with AMD to utilize its RDNA 3 architecture (again) for improved rendering speeds and hardware-accelerated ray tracing in games. Samsung adds in a separate note that it has boosted the available frames per second (FPS) in games by 28% with ray tracing enabled, a feature that typically demands a lot from a piece of hardware.</p><h2 id="the-next-gen-exynos-is-here-2">The next-gen Exynos is here</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1369px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:42.29%;"><img id="ZR98tdbu9ewtyYHiWCHrNe" name="samsung-exynos-2500-launch" alt="The Exynos 2500 brings notable AI improvements thanks to its upgraded NPU." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZR98tdbu9ewtyYHiWCHrNe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1369" height="579" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Other than the larger upgrades, Samsung detailed some of the smaller (yet equally important) specs for the Exynos 2500. Similar to the Exynos 2400, the 2500 supports 4K resolution displays at 120Hz. Moreover, its specs state the chip can support 8K resolution video recording at 30fps and 8K/60fps recordings.</p><p>Regarding photographs, Samsung says the chip can support a single (primary) camera at 320MP maximum. It also adds single camera 1080p/30fps and dual camera 64MP plus 32MP support.</p><p>Specifications include LPDDR5X memory support and UFS 4.0 storage.</p><p>The Exynos 2500 SoC's arrival comes after Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-fe-exynos-2500-impact-rumors">reportedly struggled with the chip's development</a>. In March, there were apparently uncertainties behind the chip's "production plan." As a result, it was rumored that Samsung <em>could </em>have to delay one of its devices.</p><p>More than that, Samsung's official debut of the Exynos 2500 comes at a time when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-z-flip-7-exynos-2500-chip-usage-rumored">there are rumors</a> of the Galaxy Z Flip 7 using the chip in May. Those rumors claimed the Flip 7 would do so in "most" places. So, it seems Samsung will explore a dual-chip strategy like it has done with devices previously. Speculation states regions like India and South Korea might use the Exynos 2500.</p><p>Other countries like the U.S., Canada, and China might pick up Qualcomm's chip, instead.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 chip with 4GB more RAM is closer to flagship-quality speed, and the Victus protection on the cover display makes it more likely to survive a drop.</p><p>On the other hand, its 4,000mAh battery capacity isn't the best; I've gotten accustomed to my long-lived <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">Pixel 9a</a> with 5,100mAh capacity, and I wouldn't want my phone dying on me mid-hike or run.</p><p>I may want to hold out for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Motorola Razr Ultra 2025</a>, which has even <em>faster</em> performance, extra battery capacity with 68W charging, and the best peak brightness of 3,000 nits for the cover display.

I appreciate that the Razr series is water resistant, but all it takes is some dust to mess up the inner display. Plus, all three models get <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-software-update-support">OS updates to Android 18</a>, so I'm hesitant to spend flagship-level money on the Razr Ultra when it won't stay on the cutting edge of features for long.</p><p>That's why I may decide to copy Brady and go for the base Motorola Razr 2025. Despite its downgrades compared to the Plus, I appreciate that it's more compact in hand and gets better battery life.</p><p>The Motorola Razr 2025 is normally $699, so getting the Plus for the same price right now is pretty great. But if the base model falls by a couple of hundred dollars for Prime Day — combined with a trade-in deal — and I can get this phone for the same price as a smartwatch? That would be pretty darn amazing.</p><p>So ultimately, I'm holding out for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/amazon-prime-day">Prime Day 2025</a> in the hopes of getting a great foldable deal! If the Razr isn't cheap enough, maybe Samsung will be trying to clear out stock on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>, and I can save on that instead.</p> ]]></dc:content>

These official-looking renders from Bass only double down on the chatter that the Galaxy Z Flip 7 may show up with a potential redesign, with more screen that will do more without having to flip the phone open.

Furthermore, the renders also suggest visually that the FE version looks a bit thicker than the standard Galaxy Z Flip 7.</p><p>As for the device's specs, previous rumors suggest that it could have a 6.7-inch primary screen and a 3.4-inch cover screen. The device is expected to have a 4,000 mAh battery and be powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-marketing-video-and-pricing-leak">Exynos 2400e chipset</a>.</p><p>As for the camera, the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE could have a 50MP primary lens, a 12MP ultra-wide angle lens,  and a 10MP shooter for selfies.

The Galaxy Watch 8's design sports a moderate black border/bezel around the face's circumference. The renders also show two physical buttons on one side.</p><p>Things take a turn when it comes to the Classic variant, renders show the alleged Galaxy Watch 8 Classic in a rugged and thicker, silver and black colorway, sporting what looks like a rotating bezel. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-gear/massive-galaxy-watch-8-classic-leak-all-but-confirms-its-squircle-look">Previous leaks </a>suggest that the Classic variant will supposedly arrive in a single size (47mm), with a 1.5-inch display, and will have a 450mAh battery capacity.</p><p>As for the Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025, which we've been hearing a lot lately, it could show up in a deep blue colorway with a smoother silver bezel surrounding the dial. It remains unclear if this watch will have a rotating bezel, as it seems to have a much smoother outer bezel without the ridges. The renders show the watch will possess the same two physical buttons seen on the other two models and an additional smaller orange button on one side.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming smartwatch, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p> ]]></dc:content>

The Pocket S2 Pro doesn't go <em>that</em> far, but it's still cool to see nevertheless.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qXpVZyPNAQNVVTfxXfJmL9" name="ayaneo-pocket-s2-lineup-on-table-press" alt="AYANEO Pocket S2 lineup on a table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qXpVZyPNAQNVVTfxXfJmL9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYANEO)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Lastly, AYANEO announced two "Limited Edition" models of the S2 Pro with the Retro Power and B.Duck color options.

The publication states the OEM informed it that the Magic V5 measures 8.8mm when folded. Honor adds that this marks an increasingly slimmer device over the past two iterations of the Magic V foldable series.</p><p>The Chinese OEM reiterates the Magic V2's 9.9mm size when folded and the V3's 9.2mm measurement. Honor is already dragging its competition—Samsung—into the mix, stating that it remains confident that the Magic V5 will not be beaten by the "thinner" Fold 7.</p><p>Elsewhere, in Honor's email, it thanks its "relentless pursuit of thinness" and "holistic design strategy behind the Magic V5's achievements. The company then teased a few upgrades for the Magic V5, such as its structural engineering improvements, bolstered materials, and "ultra-slim battery technology." The company didn't confirm what sort of battery we could see in the Magic V5 capacity-wise, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honors-next-foldable-phone-could-arrive-with-a-beastly-battery-upgrade">perhaps there's an upgrade in the books</a>.</p><h2 id="honor-wants-the-hilltop-2">Honor wants the Hilltop</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:337px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:178.04%;"><img id="ZKVekkX9QcbtwxJAvBQE5B" name="honor-magic-v5-thinnest-foldable-crown" alt="An image of the Honor Magic V5 from the side (closed), which is said to have an 8.8mm measurement." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZKVekkX9QcbtwxJAvBQE5B.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="337" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Honor)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Lastly, Honor says the Magic V5 will feature AI-powered processing features, which we've been expecting since MWC 2025.</p><p>Honor's been on a push with its Magic V5, as it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-announces-magic-v5-launch-date-mwc-shanghai">announced during MWC Shanghai</a> that the foldable will launch on July 2. This launch will concern China on that date. While Honor staked its claim that the Magic V5 will be the "thinnest" foldable, it shone a light on the phone as a "compelling alternative" for consumers. Honor says its Magic V5 will feature PC-like capabilities and loads of its AI software.</p><p>This AI software it briefly mentioned likely deals with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/honor-unveils-global-ai-strategy-with-usd-ten-billion">Alpha AI Plan</a>, announced during MWC in March. The company announced it would be a three-step strategy involving intelligent phones, an AI ecosystem, and AGI (Artificial General Intelligence). This new way forward for Honor has pushed it to invest ~$10 billion in this new AI strategy for its devices, all in the pursuit of more human-centric AI.</p> ]]></dc:content>

For many, a pair of truly wireless (TWS) earbuds or headphones is an essential that is carried with them every day. It makes sense — you want to watch videos, play games, listen to music, and generally hear audio without disturbing those around you. But if you only have one pair of headphones or earbuds for every situation, you're doing it wrong.</p><p>For a complete audio setup, you need three pairs of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">headphones and earbuds</a>. One pair of wireless earbuds for everyday listening, another for sleep or working out, and finally, a pair of over-ear headphones. If you have one pair of headphones in each of these three categories, you'll be covered for every type of situation.</p><p>You see, headphones and earbuds aren't a one-size-fits-all solution for all times and activities. Sometimes, you just need the right tool for the job. That tool could prioritize sound quality, comfort, fit, active noise-canceling, or battery life depending on the situation. You can cover all these needs with three pairs, and here are the ones I'd recommend.</p><h2 id="everyday-wear-samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-2">Everyday wear: Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="aLUy8iuHciU2NHQBpkHwui" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-ui-8-beta-1-auracast" alt="Using a pair of Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro to connect to an Auracast stream running on One UI 8 on a Samsnug Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aLUy8iuHciU2NHQBpkHwui.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The first pair of headphones everyone should own is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds" target="_blank">a pair of truly wireless earbuds</a> for everyday wear. These are the kind of headphones most people own, and for good reason — they're an essential. With a slim profile, decent sound quality, and great battery life, you can throw these in a pocket or bag and forget about them. When you need personal audio, you'll have it, even in times you weren't expecting to need headphones.</p><p>For most Android users, the pair of TWS earbuds to get is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro</a>. They get a lot of things right while often selling for less than their $250 list price. For starters, they're the only pair of earbuds I've tested that can match the AirPods Pro 2 in terms of active noise-canceling. Additionally, I <em>prefer</em> the sound quality of the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro to that of Apple's popular earbuds.</p><p>The sound signature feels fuller and louder, with more powerful bass that doesn't overshadow the rest of the sound you hear.

Truly wireless earbuds designed for everyday wear just aren't built for intense runs, gym workouts, or fitness activities.

The $449 retail price tag is steep compared to some members of the competition, for starters. Sonos does get a lot right in its first pair of over-ear headphones, including industry-leading comfort. If they were priced about $100 cheaper, they'd be an absolute slam-dunk buy, and that's why a deal from Walmart caught my eye.</p><p>The retailer is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1943169/565706/9383?subId1=ac-us-1122730035479278889&sharedId=hawk&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSonos-Ace-Wireless-Noise-Canceling-Headphones-Black%2F5902797595%3F" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">slashing $117 off the usual price of Sonos Ace</a>, bringing the cost down to $332.29. That's now significantly less than Sony's WH-1000XM6, Bose's QuietComfort Ultra, and Apple's AirPods Max. It's also only a bit more than you can find the last-gen Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones for at a discount.</p><p>With all this in mind, anyone in the market for a pair of quality over-ear headphones should consider snatching up the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sonos-ace-review">Sonos Ace</a> at just over $300, and I'll tell you why.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="2f72eb08-eef2-4019-99e7-512f93b480ab" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Sonos Ace:  $449.00" data-dimension48="Sonos Ace:  $449.00" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="4uieFX5MgKGvbDAahtBHrG" name="Sonos-Ace-Render-Square" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4uieFX5MgKGvbDAahtBHrG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Sonos Ace: </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Sonos-Ace-Wireless-Noise-Canceling-Headphones-Black/5902797595?" target="_blank" rel="sponsored" data-dimension112="2f72eb08-eef2-4019-99e7-512f93b480ab" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Sonos Ace:  $449.00" data-dimension48="Sonos Ace:  $449.00" data-dimension25=""><del><u>$449.00</u></del><u> </u><u><strong>$332.29 at Walmart</strong></u></a></p><p>Sonos made (sound)waves when it launched the Ace last year, its first pair of over-ear headphones. With a comfort-first design, quality ANC, and excellent sound quality, the Sonos Ace have turned out to be a popular pair of headphones. However, their price left a bit to be desired, and that's why Walmart slashing over $100 off the MSRP is huge. </p><p><strong>Price comparison:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sonos-Ace-Wireless-Headphones-Cancellation/dp/B0CYHGTMNH/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">Amazon - $388.53</a>| <a href="https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/sonos-ace" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">Sonos - $449.00</a><a class="view-deal button" href="" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="2f72eb08-eef2-4019-99e7-512f93b480ab" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Sonos Ace:  $449.00" data-dimension48="Sonos Ace:  $449.00" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you care about stylish design and comfort; you are familiar with Sonos products and have ecosystem hardware already; you want solid sound quality and active noise canceling.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you prefer Apple, Sony, or Bose noise-canceling; you expect Sonos Ace to pair with your Sonos speakers and equipment; you need the lightest pair of over-ears.</p><h2 id="ready-for-the-long-haul-2">Ready for the long haul</h2><p>Sonos Ace are the most comfortable pair of headphones I've ever worn, and you can overlook almost any of the Ace's minor shortcomings because of this. For the earcups and headband, Sonos uses memory foam cushions on the inside and a vegan leather covering on the outside. When you put Sonos Ace on, the cushions will conform to your individual head shape and retain their position for optimal comfort.</p><p>In a practical sense, this means that I can wear the Sonos Ace on a long-haul flight without ever feeling discomfort. That isn't something that I can say about the AirPods Max or the Dyson OnTrac. It also means that the 312-gram weight of the Sonos Ace isn't a problem, despite these headphones being heavier than competing options from Bose and Sony.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="gbEAWBdLUuQBCHyMwk7nPK" name="Sonos-Ace-cups-face-up.jpg" alt="Sonos Ace headphones folded flat and ear cups facing up." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gbEAWBdLUuQBCHyMwk7nPK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In terms of music listening, Sonos fans, be warned — these aren't like your Sonos speakers at home. Sonos Ace only use Wi-Fi connectivity for one thing, and that's connecting to an Arc soundbar and an iOS device <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/sonos-ace-dual-listening-truecinema-beefier-sound-realistic-update">for watching movies and TV shows</a>. For everything else, the Ace will use Bluetooth 5.4.</p><p>Sonos Ace are the only Sonos product that behaves this way, as they usually connect via Wi-Fi, but this is typical for Bluetooth headphones. Still, connectivity and sound quality are excellent, as there are two 40mm drivers right next to your ears that provide a surprisingly full spatial experience. You get dynamic head tracking, spatial audio, and Dolby Atmos support on the Sonos Ace, all of which are optional.</p><p>In terms of raw sound quality, Sonos Ace is all about balance, as you get a nice and even soundstage distribution. You won't hear overpowering bass or miss out on subtle high-end sounds, like cymbals. If you do like a bass-heavy sound, the AirPods Max provide that best, but I tend to like Sonos' balance here.</p><h2 id="the-sonos-ace-is-a-steal-at-more-than-100-off-and-you-shouldn-t-pass-on-it-2">The Sonos Ace is a steal at more than $100 off, and you shouldn't pass on it</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="99856VeUPkeNYDJPT9VRKU" name="Sonos-Ace-both-colors.jpg" alt="Sonos Ace headphones in black and soft white." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/99856VeUPkeNYDJPT9VRKU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I have a collection of over-ear headphones at my disposal, and I use a few of them for different things.

According to their post, this (ideally) cheaper Flip FE will launch alongside Samsung's upcoming flagship duo: the Galaxy Z Flip 7 and the Galaxy Z Fold 7.

It's worth mentioning that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-exynos-2400-comeback">this is a chip from 2023</a>, and was notably slower than Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 3.</p><p>What's more, the Flip 7 FE is supposedly gearing up for a "global" launch, which should place it everywhere the flagship duo will be.</p><h2 id="flipping-the-script-on-fe-2">Flipping the Script on FE?</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">"So 100% it’s confirmed"Galaxy Z Flip FE will launch with Galaxy Z Flip 7 & Galaxy Z Fold 7, and Good News is… "Globally availability"<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1937167897907843373">June 23, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>We've had rumors about a Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE for almost a year now, and they've only continued, with new ones <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-budget-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-fe-tipped-to-feature-a-flagship-caliber-display">speculating on its display</a>. A display expert alleged that Samsung could utilize its screen from the Galaxy Z Flip 6 on the upcoming Flip 7 FE variation. Of course, putting "FE" on a device typically means there will be an area or two with cutbacks. However, it seems that Samsung might not cut back on its display for the FE, giving consumers a flagship experience in that regard.</p><p>In March, renderings of the alleged Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE surfaced, and it pretty much rocked a design <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-z-flip-7-fe-leaked-minty-design-renders-specs-rumors">we've all seen before</a>.

That means your screen grabs will finally keep all the juicy contrast and brightness from what you actually see on your display.</p><p>With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a>, real <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-16-hdr-screenshots-3528355/" target="_blank">HDR screenshots are finally here</a>. Now, when you snap a shot of any HDR content, it doesn’t lose that punch you see in the original image or video.</p><p>Instead of flattening the image, it now saves everything as a PNG packed with all the right metadata, including gain maps. So when you view it on a display that’s HDR-ready, what you see is exactly what was meant to be seen, not some washed-out version.</p><p>Back when most content was SDR, Android didn’t really need HDR screenshot support. But SDR has its limits, such as muted colors and weaker contrast. You’ve probably been there: you snap a shot of a super-detailed photo, only to check the screenshot and it looks flat, dull, maybe even washed out. That’s because standard screenshots default to SDR, which just can’t keep up with all the color and brightness HDR brings to the table.</p><h2 id="hdr-screenshots-are-finally-happening-2">HDR screenshots are (finally!) happening</h2><p>According to leaker Ice Universe, the latest One UI 8 ZYF7 beta—still limited to closed testing—adds support for HDR screenshots (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-is-bringing-hdr-screenshot-support-to-one-ui-8" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>).

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>One of the complaints with a lot of Chromebooks is that you have to either sacrifice performance for the sake of battery life or vice versa. There really hasn't been an option that provides both, but I think the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 is exactly what we've been looking for.</p><p>I was lucky enough to be invited to a briefing for the device launch, alongside a bunch of other creators and executives from both Google and Lenovo. We were told about a lot of new features that are on the way for all Chromebook owners, such as "Select to search with Lens" and "Text Capture."</p><p>It's been rather difficult to be excited about Chromebook hardware over the past eight months or so. There was such a significant gap between device launches earlier this year that I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/where-have-all-the-chromebooks-gone">pondered</a> whether consumer Chromebooks were on their way out the door. However, all of that excitement has come rushing back with the debut of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/lenovo-chromebook-plus-14-advanced-hybrid-ai-powerhouse-launch">Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14</a>.</p><h2 id="power-performance-and-features-2">Power, performance, and features</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="4nGXobJSQyJnSzaSGbXAAo" name="lenovo-chromebook-plus-14-hands-on-8" alt="Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 on a desk connected to a monitor" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4nGXobJSQyJnSzaSGbXAAo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What drives that excitement is a few things. First and foremost, we have the MediaTek Kompanio Ultra 910 at the helm, making this the first Kompanio Ultra-powered Chromebook. As you might suspect, this is an ARM-based processor, which should mean we'll have excellent battery life, with Lenovo claiming the Chromebook Plus 14 will last for up to 17 hours on a single charge.</p><p>That's not completely unheard of in the Chromebook world, but it's impressive considering that the Kompanio Ultra 910 features both a dGPU and NPU. What this amounts to is an on-device Gemini experience that is said to be 32% faster and 44% more efficient. These aren't insignificant improvements; we're looking at the type of boost that was last seen when the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apple-m1-chip-helping-apple-expand-its-brand-lock">Apple M1</a> was introduced.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="j2J7TyN7RUhn9VL5fHMT9o" name="lenovo-chromebook-plus-14-hands-on-mediatek-kompanio-ultra-sticker" alt="MediaTek Kompanio Ultra logo on Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/j2J7TyN7RUhn9VL5fHMT9o.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When the various demos were being performed, the Chromebook Plus 14 didn't break a sweat. And the thing that I kept reminding myself of is that more and more of these features are being handled on-device, as opposed to being offloaded to the cloud. I'm excited about the prospect of having access to more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> features, even if I'm not connected to the internet.</p><p>Unique to the Chromebook Plus 14 are "Smart grouping" and "Image editing in the Gallery app." As someone who has at least 20-30 tabs open at any given time, I breathed a sigh of relief during the presentation.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item"

Lenovo definitely nailed it here, as the Chromebook Plus 14 is sleek and lightweight. It screams "premium" from top to bottom, starting with the display.</p><p>We have a 14-inch 2K OLED display that looks fantastic, with great viewing angles and vivid colors. There's even a slight protrusion along the top, where you'll find the admittedly disappointing 5MP webcam. It's serviceable, but definitely leaves a bit to be desired.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="mLLSrJboGDDZoeHCb3RqAo" name="lenovo-chromebook-plus-14-hands-on-2" alt="Close-up on Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 keyboard" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mLLSrJboGDDZoeHCb3RqAo.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="Sj7Jw9dTjqRBegMzy9jf5o" name="lenovo-chromebook-plus-14-hands-on-1" alt="Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 in-hand testing deck flex" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Sj7Jw9dTjqRBegMzy9jf5o.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="jUQimUo3VJq2GetxyAJB3o" name="lenovo-chromebook-plus-14-hands-on-10" alt="Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jUQimUo3VJq2GetxyAJB3o.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Regarding the keyboard, if you've used a Lenovo Chromebook or laptop in the past few years, you'll feel right at home. Oh, and I was happy to see the return of the Quick Insert Key, something that debuted with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review">Galaxy Chromebook Plus</a>, but has yet to be added to other Chromebooks.</p><p>If there's one concern I have here, it's with the trackpad. Apple spoiled me with its Magic Trackpad, and outside of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/hp-dragonfly-pro-chromebook-review">HP Dragonfly Pro</a>, I've yet to find anything that comes close. While it didn't feel like the Chromebook Plus 14 was using a glass trackpad, it also didn't feel very cheap like some of the other options out there. So this is something I'll be paying closer attention to once my review unit arrives.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="3URuo4rCdaEbzDXa4oJ8Ao" name="lenovo-chromebook-plus-14-hands-on-9" alt="Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 close-up on keyboard, trackpad, and fingerprint scanner" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3URuo4rCdaEbzDXa4oJ8Ao.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The last thing I wanted to touch on regarding the design is the bottom casing. While aluminum adorns the lid and keyboard deck, we have plastic on the bottom, and it might look familiar to those who owned a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/pixelbook-go-second-opinion-review">Pixelbook Go</a>.</p><p>Neither Google nor Lenovo explicitly came out and said that it was inspired by the Pixelbook Go, but it's pretty obvious that's the case. Lenovo did share that it opted for this design because it makes it easier to carry around the Chromebook Plus 14 without feeling like it is going to slip out of your hands. No matter the reason, it's kind of cool to see, if not just for adding another layer of uniqueness to this device.</p><h2 id="this-could-be-the-change-chromebooks-needed-2">This could be the "change" Chromebooks needed</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="3qihZzf3Ve962cjz9wYk6o" name="lenovo-chromebook-plus-14-hands-on-6" alt="Generating images using Gemini on Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3qihZzf3Ve962cjz9wYk6o.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Ultimately, I think what makes me so excited about the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 is that this <em>might</em> just be the "Apple M1 moment" we've been waiting for. Lenovo and Google have been working on this specific device for some time, culminating in a Chromebook that is elegant, powerful, and cuts very few corners.</p><p>I already know it's not <em>perfect</em>, as we should definitely have something better than a 5MP webcam. Plus, offering a version with 256GB of storage is a good start, but I do wish there were configurations with more storage. There's a specific reason as to why (<em>cough</em> AI <em>cough</em>), but I'll save those thoughts for later.</p><p>Nevertheless, on the surface, Lenovo and Google checked most, if not all, of the important boxes for a flagship Chromebook Plus device. I'm seriously excited to spend more time with the Chromebook Plus 14 and will report back soon with my final thoughts, once my review unit arrives and I can dig in.</p> ]]></dc:content>

As a bit of house cleaning, the company states the laptop is available with a 14-inch display. The latest Chromebook Plus focuses on professionals, creators, and students, delivering a premium feel throughout the device. Lenovo states this display features a 2K resolution.</p><p>Design-wise, the post highlights the laptop's minimalist design elements, its aluminum chassis, and a backlit keyboard.</p><p>Lenovo touts its Chromebook Plus' touchpad, which should provide a more seamless scrolling approach. On the front of the laptop is a 5MP webcam that also features a physical privacy shutter. Those looking to multitask a little might find the laptop's support for two external displays at 4K resolution useful.</p><h2 id="ai-for-here-and-ai-to-go-2">AI for here and AI to go</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1062px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.50%;"><img id="HXsk4FChWXRzxjZDwpT2MR" name="lenovo-chromebook-plus-overview" alt="The Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14's overview, highlighting its flagship MediaTek chip and loads of AI software." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HXsk4FChWXRzxjZDwpT2MR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1062" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Lenovo)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Lenovo and Google claim this Chromebook Plus is extremely powerful in terms of its AI capabilities. Even Lenovo's executive director and general manager of Chromebooks, Benny Zhang, said, "Whether you are an executive needing AI performance through the day, an artist wishing to create out the studio, or an everday user looking to browse, learn or play, this premium device is your perfect everyday companion."</p><p>What's empowering this laptop is MediaTek's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek/mediatek-kompanio-ultra-next-gen-chromebook-plus-announced">Kompanio Ultra processor</a>, the brand's flagship CPU. This enabled the companies to build <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> directly into the 14-inch Chromebook Plus by Lenovo. With the AI available in the device's shelf, Gemini brings "Select to Search" backed by Lens, so users can find items on their screen without switching tabs/windows. Text Capture comes in as a quick note-taker, grabbing important dates or blurbs from your documents and popping them into Calendar or Docs.</p><p>Moreover, Lenovo states this Chromebook Plus features an upgraded variant of "Help me Read," simplifying heavy, jargon-filled text with the option to ask follow-up questions.</p><p>On Google's side, the company introduced two exclusive features that you'll only find on Lenovo's new Chromebook Plus: Smart Grouping and AI Image Editing. When using the former, the laptop's on-device AI will "intelligently" understand and organize your tabs and documents into like-minded groups. For your images, the AI Image editor enters for the Gallery app, letting users remove backgrounds and turn photos into stickers.</p><h2 id="ready-when-you-are-2">Ready when you are</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:900px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="bg5t3bicYq7xCfxYDmJWEb" name="lenovo-chromebook-plus-14-official-render" alt="The Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bg5t3bicYq7xCfxYDmJWEb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="900" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Lenovo)</span></figcaption></figure><p>According to Lenovo, their latest Chromebook Plus "can be available with Google's Chrome Education upgrade." This lets schools and IT admins manage the ChromeOS and tailor it to their specific needs.</p><p>The laptop has a lot going on under the hood, but portability and longevity are the name of the game, so here's a battery that fits. Lenovo states its laptop is outfitted with a 17-hour battery in a package that weighs roughly 2.6 pounds. More than that, it should remain strong enough to handle multiple tasks, thanks to 16GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage. The device also supports Wi-Fi 7 connectivity.</p><p>The Lenovo Chromebook Plus is available today (June 23), starting at $649 through your expected consumer/commercial channels.</p><ul><li><strong>Laptop deals: </strong><a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-us/category/laptop-deals"><u><strong>Dell</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/promo/laptop-and-computer-deals"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/laptops/1089430"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/d/deals/laptops/?tabkey=Laptop%20Deals"><u><strong>Lenovo</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/slp/weekly-deals/laptops"><u><strong>HP</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.newegg.com/PCs-Laptops/EventSaleStore/ID-1071"><u><strong>Newegg</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Laptops-Todays-Deals-Computers-Tablets/s?rh=n%3A565108%2Cp_n_deal_type%3A23566064011"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

As much as I like RayNeo's products, they require plenty of adjustments to dial in on the fit, and that's thankfully not an issue on the Max 2. The glasses have a plastic chassis that's relatively light at 76g, and the frame has a decent amount of adjustability to it.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="yuYdtbJBWzhTuJpCCEkESn" name="Rokid Max 2 AR Glasses" alt="Rokid Max 2 AR Glasses review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yuYdtbJBWzhTuJpCCEkESn.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5000" height="2816" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4971px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="W7f5H2QJAxer73fLDF5eCn" name="Rokid Max 2 AR Glasses" alt="Rokid Max 2 AR Glasses review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/W7f5H2QJAxer73fLDF5eCn.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4971" height="2800" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Where the design truly shines is the customizability. The Max 2 comes vision adjustment, giving you granular control over the focus of the Micro-OLED panel according to your eyesight. This makes a huge difference in usability, and it ensures the Max 2 delivers a crystal-clear picture at all times.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5115px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="9tTbnwWkAceWB7mEZvPXJn" name="Rokid Max 2 AR Glasses" alt="Rokid Max 2 AR Glasses review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9tTbnwWkAceWB7mEZvPXJn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5115" height="2881" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Honestly, after using these glasses for the better part of a month, I don't see myself going back to AR glasses that don't have this feature. You can use the built-in dials above the rim, and there's no fringing whatsoever once you adjust either lens. The nose bridge has soft pads that are comfortable, and I didn't see any fatigue even after using the Max 2 for well over an hour.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4778px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="Y5JkpCUaxJWJewN7h9h4Mn" name="Rokid Max 2 AR Glasses" alt="Rokid Max 2 AR Glasses review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Y5JkpCUaxJWJewN7h9h4Mn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4778" height="2691" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another positive is the coating on the front shade; it is sufficiently dark that it tunes out ambient light, allowing for a clearer picture. Basically, Rokid nailed all the basics here, and the Max 2 showcase the potential of AR glasses. On that note, there are controls under the right side of the frame, and the USB-C connector is located at the end of the left frame.</p><p>I didn't see any issues connecting the Max 2 to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x200-ultra-review">Vivo X200 Ultra</a>, Pixel 9 Pro Fold, Pixel 9 Pro XL, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a>, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-ipad-pro-m4-13-inch-long-term-review">iPad Pro M4</a>. The Sony Micro-OLED panel is a known quantity in this category, and it delivers good brightness levels and excellent image fidelity.

You get AptX Lossless codecs, and the biggest differentiator is 96kHz/24-bit audio — it's great to see Xiaomi leverage Qualcomm's audio suite.

You'll need to be in the Xiaomi ecosystem to take full advantage of some of the extras, and if you're got the Xiaomi 15 or 15 Ultra, these buds are a no-brainer recommendation.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="3242cd64-16b4-405f-ab67-01263be69e64">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:97.49%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nsVkGVwKmaH8P6GshEfoGG.jpg' alt="Xiaomi Buds 5 Pro"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Xiaomi Buds 5 Pro</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>With great sound and unmatched connectivity, the Buds 5 Pro are among the best earbuds you can get today. </p></p>                </div>                <div class="pro-con"></div>            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

Ask it back then, and it would just point you to another app.</p><p>But according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/06/19/gemini-app-song-search/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, that’s changed. Over the past few weeks, Gemini quietly picked up built-in song search, finally closing a major gap with its predecessor and making it feel more like a fully-loaded assistant for Android users.</p><h2 id="just-ask-and-play-2">Just ask and play</h2><p>To try out Gemini’s new song ID skill, just say, “What song is this?” It’ll then launch a full-screen mode and ask you to play, sing, or hum the tune. While it listens, you’ll see that signature pulsing sphere in action as it hunts down the closest match using Google’s smarts.</p><p>Gemini’s music-matching skills work across the board, meaning it can catch songs playing nearby, in your playlists, or even ones you hum.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:383px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.54%;"><img id="cDwTGfCjCkhBQqv5m5FbKi" name="Gemini-app-song-search" alt="song search feature in the Gemini app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cDwTGfCjCkhBQqv5m5FbKi.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="383" height="860" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:383px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.54%;"><img id="iWkGF5cojPYZznXhM83aKi" name="Gemini-app-song-search" alt="song search feature in the Gemini app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iWkGF5cojPYZznXhM83aKi.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="383" height="860" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><h2 id="still-a-bit-clunky-2">Still a bit clunky</h2><p>While Gemini on Android can now ID songs, it’s not fully baked into the Gemini experience just yet. When you ask it to name a tune, it actually hands things off to the Google app’s full-screen listening mode.</p><p>It works, but it’s not as smooth or seamless as something like Pixel’s built-in Now Playing feature, which still takes the lead when it comes to smooth song ID. You can trigger it with a quick voice command or tap the lock screen shortcut, and it delivers results right in the interface. Plus, it works offline, which is a major win.</p><p>Another thing that sets Gemini’s song ID apart from a fully integrated setup is that it shows the results on a Google Search page instead of keeping it in the chat. So instead of a smooth, in-line answer like you’d get from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a>, you’re bumped out of the conversation flow, making the experience feel a bit disjointed.</p><p>Currently, Song Search is only live in Gemini on Android. Google hasn’t officially said when (or if) it’s coming to iOS, but chances are it’s just a phased rollout.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It's a journey that's taken me five years to get to, and while I've slowly climbed the ranks among my fellow Spartans over the years, I still have a <em>long</em> way to go before I ever consider the possibility of making the podium.</p><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Sunday Runday</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rV2GgqHS9nqccNipGMkWqB" name="lloyd-break-dancing.jpg" caption="" alt="Lloyd, the Android Central mascot, break-dancing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rV2GgqHS9nqccNipGMkWqB.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text">Sunday Runday is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/sunday-runday">weekly column</a> that talks about the world of wearables, apps, and fitness tech related to running and health. Normally written by Android Central Wearables Editor Michael Hicks, this week is a guest post by Android Central Senior Editor Nicholas Sutrich, who has been on a fitness journey since 2020 when he tried CrossFit for the first time.</p></div></div><p>Regardless if I ever podium, though, the key to improvement is through training. Quantifying my results with a smartwatch is extraordinarily helpful, but with the variety of obstacles and types of fitness found throughout a Spartan race, which watch is the best way to track things?</p><p>I turned to two of my favorites from last year, the OnePlus Watch 3 and Google Pixel Watch 3, both of which I've regularly turned to because of their fitness-tracking accuracy and detailed stats. And while I prefer the smaller size of the 41mm Pixel Watch 3, the battery life of the OnePlus Watch 3 is an even better plus.</p><p>After I finished the race, I compared my stats using a combination of tools. Strava pulled the data off my OnePlus Watch 3, while Google's Fitbit does all the work for the Pixel. All of those were dumped into a web-based tool called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://quantified-self.io">Quantified Self</a>, which makes it easy to directly compare stats and GPS-tracked maps at a glance. Now, for the results.</p><h2 id="let-s-get-spartan-2">Let's get Spartan</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7yWScscKFK2EGWfJYJJnUb" name="oneplus-watch-3-google-pixel-watch-3-spartan-race-map" alt="A GPS-generated map of a Spartan Race comparing the OnePlus Watch 3 and Google Pixel 3's GPS tracking accuracy" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7yWScscKFK2EGWfJYJJnUb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you've never attended a Spartan Race before, here's the gist. Spartan Races come in three lengths: Sprint (5K, 20+ obstacles), Super (10K, 25+ obstacles), Beast (21K, 30+ obstacles), and Ultra (50K, 60+ obstacles). Obstacles are a variety of challenges that include anything from rope climbs to crawling under barbed wire, angled walls that you have to run or climb over, and even carrying heavy objects for a set length.</p><p>To date, I've only run Sprints and have no intention of running longer. I'm not Michael Hicks, and I can't run <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/what-i-learned-running-20-mile-race-wearing-four-watches" target="_blank">20-mile races</a>, but I have participated in Ninja Warrior competitions in the past, so obstacles are my strong suit. The varied nature of a Spartan Race makes it tough to measure with a watch that's built for running, but they still provide a good measure of data to work with for comparison.</p><p>Normally, I run Spartan Races in my home state of North Carolina, where things are a lot hillier, but I decided to try one while on vacation in the much flatter (and hotter) state of Florida.</p><div ><table><caption>Post-run 20-miler stats from four fitness watches</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>OnePlus Watch 3</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel Watch 3</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Distance</strong></p></td><td  ><p>5.26 Km</p></td><td  ><p>5.33 Km</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Pace</strong></p></td><td  ><p>11:37 min/km</p></td><td  ><p>11:05 min/km</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Ascent / Decent</strong></p></td><td  ><p>0 m / 0 m</p></td><td  ><p>35 m / 50 m</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Avg. / max heart rate</strong></p></td><td  ><p>177 bpm / 195 bpm</p></td><td  ><p>177 bpm / 200 bpm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Running power average / max</strong></p></td><td  ><p>93 W / 532 W</p></td><td  ><p>N/A</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Calories</strong></p></td><td  ><p>852 kcal</p></td><td  ><p>864 kcal</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Steps</strong></p></td><td  ><p>7,049</p></td><td  ><p>7,042</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Cadence</strong></p></td><td  ><p>117 spm</p></td><td  ><p>112 spm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Stride length</strong></p></td><td  ><p>0.74m</p></td><td  ><p>0.74m</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Vertical oscillation</strong></p></td><td  ><p>7.7cm</p></td><td  ><p>8.1cm</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>While both watches are pretty even keel across the board, a few stats stood out to me. First off is the elevation change, where the OnePlus Watch 3 seemed to think Florida is a lot flatter than it actually is.</p><p>While the majority of the circuit through Burt Aaronson South County Regional Park in Boca Raton is extraordinarily flat by my North Carolinian standards, several obstacles were above or below the elevation of most of the rest of the course.</p><p>The bucket carry, for instance, had me trek up a man-made hill that was a few dozen feet high, while another obstacle had us wading through a pond that we had to navigate down a hill to reach.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3062px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:49.12%;"><img id="yiLsHsMLGD4Nj8PvptJRjW" name="oneplus-watch-3-google-pixel-watch-3-spartan-race-altitude" alt="Altitude measurements during a Spartan race while wearing a OnePlus Watch 3 and a Google Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yiLsHsMLGD4Nj8PvptJRjW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3062" height="1504" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Looking at the graph, it's clear something malfunctioned on the OnePlus Watch 3. Whether this was a bug or something else, I'm not sure, but I know that I didn't get accurate altitude information from the OnePlus Watch 3. I've never seen it do this outside of this one race (of course), and I've taken it hiking several times.</p><p>I know this was a fluke though, because when I look at the rest of the data, both watches are impressively neck-and-neck. This is impressive to me because it confirms my thoughts in my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-hands-on">OnePlus Watch 3 initial impressions</a> where I said that OnePlus fixed all the issues I had with the OnePlus Watch 2, namely giving it accurate fitness tracking capabilities.</p><p>OnePlus outfitted the OnePlus Watch 3 with a more precise dual-frequency GPS, and it shows when you zoom into the map. In the map below, the OnePlus Watch 3 is <strong>orange</strong>, while the Pixel Watch 3 is <strong>blue</strong>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:985px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:46.29%;"><img id="utcBdHXhpV6apZLkGDksHb" name="oneplus-watch-3-google-pixel-watch-3-spartan-race-map-01" alt="A GPS-generated map of a Spartan Race comparing the OnePlus Watch 3 and Google Pixel 3's GPS tracking accuracy" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/utcBdHXhpV6apZLkGDksHb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="985" height="456" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I know from running the course that I wasn't running around as erratically as the Pixel Watch 3 suggests. For instance, I know I didn't run under the trees on the right side of the image. I stuck to the path as the OnePlus Watch 3's track shows.</p><p>Likewise, the strange loop you see on the left side from the Pixel Watch 3 didn't happen like it shows. That was a 20-foot rope wall that I had to scale, then flip around and make my way back down. The OnePlus Watch 3 has a similar circular motion to the path, but it's much more inline with my actual movements.</p><h2 id="which-is-best-2">Which is best?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="gTkpyfbJXQDEEZgpK7BhoC" name="oneplus-watch-3-vs-google-pixel-watch-3" alt="Wearing a OnePlus Watch 3 and a Google Pixel Watch 3 on separate arms to compare them" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gTkpyfbJXQDEEZgpK7BhoC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Looking at the rest of the bevy of available stats — it's seriously overwhelming if you don't know what these mean — it's clear both watches are close enough to each other in tracking to call this a tie. Even the heart rate was dead on, showing a 177 bpm average for the duration of the hour-long race.</p><p>For me, the choice between the two can be broken down into two main points. Want a smaller smartwatch that's extra comfortable to wear? The Google Pixel Watch 3 is the best choice for that right now, but a smaller OnePlus Watch 3 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-expands-its-mid-tier-lineup">is on the way</a> that will surely challenge it.</p><p>If you want a watch with excellent fitness-tracking capabilities and a battery that'll last you an average of 4 days on a single charge — yes, even with regular fitness and GPS tracking — the OnePlus Watch 3 is a no-brainer. This is OnePlus's best year yet, and it's great to see the company improving its products in meaningful ways that mean you won't have to sacrifice something when choosing them.

Smaller sensors and lower resolutions sometimes can result in noisier images that just don't look as good.</p><p>Flip phones still have front-facing cameras on the display, but to be honest, I rarely ever use them, and if I do, it's to hop on a video call. But if I ever want to take a selfie, I close the phone and turn on the camera. This way, not only can I view myself using the cover screen, but it lets me take selfies with the superior quality of the primary camera.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="PDzsWCXuPt3JBd5F7Lm5dj" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-camera-sample-9.jpg" alt="Taking a selfie in front of a ferris wheel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PDzsWCXuPt3JBd5F7Lm5dj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="3072" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What's great is that you don't need an expensive flip phone to make it happen; even the cheaper ones with smaller cover screens normally provide a selfie preview.

Once it's done, it'll stitch them into a fun 4x4 collage.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-capturing-your-best-angles"><span>Capturing your best angles</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kmxA8vznEPkq9pPkTqSiFo" name="motorola-razr-plus-2024-closed-camera-viewfinder-01" alt="Taking a picture of me taking a picture of the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 with its cover screen camera viewfinder active" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kmxA8vznEPkq9pPkTqSiFo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of the worst things is to have your picture taken by someone else, only for it to come out badly or show you at an awkward angle. You're pretty much at the mercy of whoever is capturing the photo, and you just have to hope that at least one of the voters that they're taking comes out good enough to post on Instagram.</p><p>With most flip phones, this becomes a thing of the past. With their expansive cover screens, phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Motorola Razr</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip</a> allow you to turn on a preview of the viewfinder. That way, when you're taking a photo of someone, they can see themselves and angle themselves appropriately, ensuring that you're capturing their best side.</p><p>I use this anytime I take photos of friends, and they always comment on how cool and useful it is that they can see themselves.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-this-one-s-for-the-tiktokers"><span>This one's for the TikTokers</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="cd5KaAGAXKDYu4ARsYcVQc" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-auto-zoom-selfie-01.jpg" alt="The Auto Zoom on the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cd5KaAGAXKDYu4ARsYcVQc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you're a TikToker or content creator, this one's for you. Instead of buying a tripod or another accessory to prop your phone up while recording a video, you can just take a flip phone, set it down somewhere, and fold it at an angle. With the cover screen viewfinder, you'll be able to see yourself while you record your videos. And again, since you're not using the front camera, the quality should be much better than with a traditional smartphone.</p><p>This is one of my favorite ways to take hands-free "selfies" that don't look like selfies and appear to have been taken by someone else. This works great when paired with Air Gestures, which activate a short countdown when you hold your hand up at the camera. And for video, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-camera-review">Razr Ultra</a> also lets you control videos in a similar fashion, letting you start, pause, or end video recording by showing your palm or fist.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MgWpePvVCJjkwATPLpDGXf" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2025-paddleboard" alt="The Motorola Razr Plus 2025 on a paddleboard" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MgWpePvVCJjkwATPLpDGXf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>However, it can also be a great way to capture footage of not just yourself, but also of other things.

There’s quite a bit that might entice you to upgrade or buy the newest option, but some features that might convince you to stick with what you have or save with an older model, at least for now.

The device sports a 6.7-inch pOLED Super HD HDR10+ screen with 2,712 x 1,220 resolution, 120Hz refresh rate, and up to 4,500 nits brightness.</p><p>The screen is also Pantone SkinTone validated to ensure accurate color reproduction. Although Nicholas Sutrich notes in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-edge-2025-review" target="_blank">his review of the Motorola Edge 2025</a> that the screen exhibits mura issues and employs color dithering to simulate deeper colors than the panel can actually produce. He finds the supposed higher resolution not worth the trade-off in refresh rate, which is actually higher in the Motorola Edge 2024.</p><p>Finished in soft-touch vegan leather with a slight curve to its design that Sutrich calls “gorgeous,” the phone comes in just one color, Forest Green, which Sutrich describes as “stunning.” The screen is further protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 7, along with an anti-fingerprint coating.</p><p>It’s ultra-durable, sporting both an IP68 and IP69 rating for resistance against dust and water. It also meets MIL-STD-810H standards for protection against things like drops, falls, and bumps.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="mUXSsTuSWSJfLmTeTcumcN" name="Motorola-Edge-2025-back-03" alt="The vegan leather back of the forest green Motorola Edge 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mUXSsTuSWSJfLmTeTcumcN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You only get a single storage option of 256GB along with a 5,200mAh battery, which Motorola says can last for up to two days. If you charge it for just six minutes, you can get up to a full extra day, great for those in a rush who need a quick power boost before walking out the door. The phone supports 68W TurboPower charging (with an optional adapter) and 15W TurboPower wireless charging.</p><p>Equipped with dual speakers that support Dolby Atmos, it has two mics as well. You get only two OS upgrades, and Motorola does not indicate how long the phone will receive security updates. That’s shorter than Motorola’s usual offering of three years of OS updates, a strange change for this device that would only take you into Android 18. It has both fingerprint and face unlock.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4KWxAgEZrjUT7rEfeUNtHU" name="motorola-edge-2024-display-home-pink.jpg" alt="The homescreen of the Motorola Edge (2024)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4KWxAgEZrjUT7rEfeUNtHU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>By comparison, the Motorola Edge 2024, introduced in June 2024, features a slightly smaller 6.6-inch AMOLED FHD+ screen with a resolution of 2,400 x 1080 and a lower peak brightness of 1,300 nits.

That’s something to consider if you decide to purchase this phone, or if you’re currently using it and considering an upgrade.</p><p>It has a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-7s-gen-2-launch">Snapdragon 7s Gen 2</a> processor and the same 8GB RAM with RAM Boost, but Sutrich calls the processor slow, likening it to ancient phones like the LG V60. However, he says it is efficient, doesn’t drain the battery quickly while in use, and is suitable for playing modern games like Genshin Impact without performance issues. But you won’t be able to run higher detail settings, resolutions, or framerates.</p><p>Like the Motorola Edge 2025, the Motorola Edge 2024 supports <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/motorola-smart-connect-meta-quest-3">Smart Connect</a> as well, a great feature for multitaskers. “There’s something magical about controlling your smartphone with the same keyboard and mouse that simultaneously controls your PC,” enthuses Sutrich.</p><h2 id="motorola-edge-2025-vs-edge-2024-taking-photos-2">Motorola Edge 2025 vs. Edge 2024: Taking photos</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wA5y2ow7qmts2XPvdcgqiT" name="Motorola-Edge-2025-camera-01" alt="Taking a macro shot of red flowers with the Motorola Edge 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wA5y2ow7qmts2XPvdcgqiT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When it comes to the cameras, the Motorola Edge 2025 and Motorola Edge 2024 differ significantly. While Sutrich points out that a weak point of the Motorola Edge 2024 was its cameras, he says the issues have been fixed with the Motorola Edge 2025 thanks to not only upgrades to ultrawide and selfie cameras, but also the addition of a telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom.</p><p>The Motorola Edge 2025 has a pro-grade camera system with four cameras, including a 50MP main with wide-angle with Macro Vision, a 50MP rear, a 10MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom and up to 30x Super Zoom, and a 50MP front camera with autofocus, ideal for taking fantastic selfies and group shots.

If you just want to take basic photos for sharing in messages or on social media, it will suffice. But he adds that even launching the camera is slow and feels clunky, with lag between when you try to launch the camera and it’s ready to use. Even photo capture itself is slow with odd shutter lag.</p><p>You won’t be able to take great motion capture pictures either, so if you have kids or pets, forget about this device.

Between the Motorola Edge 2025 vs Edge 2024, which should you choose? Whether you already have the Motorola Edge 2024 or you’re looking to buy new, your best bet is to buy or upgrade to the Motorola Edge 2025. The Motorola Edge 2024 is only supported through this latest OS. So, once Google launches Android 17, you won’t be able to update to it. This means you still have some time, so you can mull it over through the next 12 months if you’re on a tight budget and still unsure.</p><p>What upgrades do you get with the Motorola Edge 2025? To summarize, it features a slightly larger and higher-resolution screen with significantly higher peak brightness. It features an additional camera and improved overall camera capabilities. It has a bigger and purportedly longer-lasting battery. It’s also more durable, with stronger Gorilla Glass on the screen and a higher IP rating. Plus, let’s not forget all the premium AI features that come with this phone.</p><p>The Motorola Edge 2024 boasts a stunning design, a faster refresh rate than the Motorola Edge 2025, and a Snapdragon processor versus a MediaTek processor, although, based on Sutrich’s review, this isn’t necessarily a significant advantage. It’s still pretty rugged, has the same amount of RAM and storage, decent battery life with charging at the same rate, and access to limited AI features through Google Photos. But the cameras are a massive step down, and performance is limited.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="yt2wVsDKRDW64hLbwPmVm" name="motorola-edge-2024-back-03.jpg" alt="The gorgeous vegan leather back of the Motorola Edge (2024)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yt2wVsDKRDW64hLbwPmVm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Thus, the Motorola Edge 2025 is a step up that’s worth taking. With that said, if you’re upgrading, you might be better off looking for an even bigger and better step up. Consider <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">the best Android phones</a> you can buy right now, and potentially even a different brand. For a tighter budget, look at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">the best cheap Android phones</a>. Some of the top phones in a similar price range to the Motorola Edge 2025 are the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">Google Pixel 9a</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a>, both of which outperform this device. You might end up being happier with either of these phones.</p><p>If you are adamant about sticking with Motorola, however, consider <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones">the best Motorola phones</a> for additional alternatives. Interestingly, with this brand, you’ll probably get the best bang for your buck with a foldable phone. Among <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">the best foldable phones</a>, Motorola has some high-performing options that make the list, and are a fraction of the cost of competitors.</p><p>Otherwise, if you’re only considering these two devices, either to buy new or upgrade, go with the Motorola Edge 2025. It brings you into the world of AI, bumps up specs with cameras that are miles ahead, and it’s offered at a decent price.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="abece3cd-47bd-49b8-b213-2296120f6636">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LBMcwTEvmFhbHXUbog2FBX.jpg' alt="Motorola Edge 2025"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Motorola Edge 2025</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Not the best Motorola phone you can buy</strong></em></p><p>The Motorola Edge 2025 is better than the Motorola Edge 2024, but it's still not the best Motorola phone, or affordable Android phone for that matter, that you can buy.

They sound much better than I imagined, the connectivity is rock-solid, and they have the best isolation of any product I've used yet. If you're in the Apple ecosystem and want an audio upgrade, this is definitely the way to go.</p><p>I use my AirPods Max with plenty of Android phones too, and they hold up just as well as the Bose QC Ultra or Sony WH-1000XM5. The USB-C model is highly convenient to use as it charges using the same cable as all of my other gear, and a new software update unlocks high-res audio, making the headset that much more versatile. The AirPods Max usually retail for $549, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/AirPods-Max-Blue/11347872631">they're down to $479 right now</a>, putting them on the same footing as Sony's new WH-1000XM6.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="48d91744-6857-4a5b-b040-a89989cc86db" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="The AirPods Max combine an elegant design with amazing sound, and they have excellent noise isolation.

The aluminum chassis is heavier than the plastic-clad Bose and Sony headsets, but it gives the Max better durability, and I didn't see any issues with reliability even after a year of extensive use.</p><p>While it doesn't look like it, the design has much better comfort than I imagined. The memory foam ear pads do a good job even with extended use, and the knit headband is highly breathable. I also like that you get the Max in unique color options — that's just not the case with most headsets in this category.</p><p>What makes the AirPods Max stand out is the sound quality; they have a powerful low-end combined with clean mids and an airy treble, and they do a fantastic job with a diverse set of genres. Also great is the spatial audio mode; there's a noticeable difference to the sound, and the increased soundstage makes music that much more immersive.</p><p>The noise isolation is unmatched; the AirPods Max do an incredible job tuning out ambient noises in the vicinity, and they're much more effective than Sony — something I didn't think was possible. I had no problems using the headset on a 10-hour flight, and battery life is equivalent to Bose and Sony rivals.</p><p>Basically, the AirPods Max are among the best headsets available today, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/AirPods-Max-Blue/11347872631">discount to $479</a> makes them that much more accessible.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Combined with the node shift to 3nm, the 8 Elite delivered massive gains across the board, and it continues to be one of the fastest mobile platforms available today.</p><p>Qualcomm isn't sitting idly by either — the chip vendor is pushing up the launch of this year's flagship, the Snapdragon 8 Elite 2. That is a big deal in itself, as it allows device makers to launch phones and tablets based on the chipset sooner than ever before. This is what we know about the Snapdragon 8 Elite 2, and when it will make its debut.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-2-cpu"><span>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite 2: CPU</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bScw4JoPDKnTFhQdgfAWGB" name="Snapdrag-8-elite" alt="Shot of the stage from Unpacked 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bScw4JoPDKnTFhQdgfAWGB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Qualcomm went back to using custom cores with the Snapdragon 8 Elite, and the 8 Elite 2 is set to build on this foundation. It will use a similar design that should see two performance cores alongside six mid-size cores, and it is also likely to be fabricated on the 3nm node.</p><p>What's interesting is that a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5176636804695617">leak out of China</a> details the Snapdragon 8 Elite 2's Geekbench scores, and with a single-core score of over 4,000 and multi-core going over 11,000, it has a significant boost over the 8 Elite. To put that into context, the maximum I got in Geekbench with the Snapdragon 8 Elite is 3,190 in single-core and 9,957 in multi-core results.</p><p>Essentially, Qualcomm is targeting an increase of up to 30% in single-core workloads, and up to 12% in multi-core scenarios. That's a huge deal considering the sheer performance differential between the Snapdragon 8 Elite and 8 Gen 3, and it's exciting to see the chip vendor able to deliver these kind of gains for the second year in a row.</p><p>Of course, these details are based on a leak, so we will need to wait and see how the Snapdragon 8 Elite 2 holds up in real-world testing.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-2-gaming"><span>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite 2: Gaming</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2610px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rRUXiFcY6iXrsZAHShZKPR" name="Snapdragon-8-Elite-Gaming" alt="A photo showing a gaming phone with the Snapdragon 8 Elite logo hovering above it" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rRUXiFcY6iXrsZAHShZKPR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2610" height="1468" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Snapdragon 8 Elite is a gaming powerhouse, and it has a significantly higher overhead when it comes to playing demanding titles. I didn't see any issues getting stable framerates even with all the settings turned up, and if anything, the gaming ecosystem on Android is the bottleneck — we need console-quality titles like iOS.</p><p>While we don't know what changes Qualcomm is making to Adreno this year, the one thing I'd like to see is better thermal thresholds. The Snapdragon 8 Elite tends to run hotter than earlier versions, and that means resultant devices overheat even with sizeable thermal management solutions. Qualcomm needs to do a better job setting thermal boundaries on the 8 Elite 2 to ensure this isn't an issue on 2026 flagships.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-2-launch-date"><span>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite 2: Launch date</span></h3><p>Qualcomm has confirmed that it is accelerating the launch window of the Snapdragon 8 Elite 2. The chipset will be showcased at the chip vendor's annual Snapdragon Summit, being held on September 23. Qualcomm usually holds its launch event sometime in Q4, with the initial wave of devices featuring its latest chipset debuting in Q1.</p><p>Clearly, it wants to change that dynamic, and by launching the Snapdragon 8 Elite 2 early, it will be able to position it better alongside the upcoming A19 — which will also be announced at a similar time.</p><hr><p>While there's plenty we don't know about the Snapdragon 8 Elite 2 — including changes to the camera and connectivity — we should get those details over the coming weeks, and I'll update this post accordingly.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Sales of the Galaxy S25 Edge in the phone's first month on the market are "below expectations," according to a report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=37255" target="_blank">The Elec</a>.  The low demand for the Galaxy S25 Edge could impact Samsung's plans for the upcoming Galaxy S26 lineup, per the publication.</p><p>The Elec notes that production of the Galaxy S25 Edge "plummeted" compared to last month, which doesn't bode well for the model. As the report explains, the first few months after a smartphone launches usually coincides with consistent mass production. It's unusual for a brand-new smartphone to see its production cut significantly this shortly following its release.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is a controversial smartphone that cut a few corners to hit its impressive 5.8mm thickness. It's the thinnest commercially-available smartphone on the market, but it also has a power-hungry chip and display paired with a measly 3,900mAh battery and slow 25W wired charging speeds. There also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-camera-review">isn't a telephoto camera onboard</a>, and it's the only Galaxy S25 series phone to omit one.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yRPgT7JZSbnDWsdgnDvG5Z" name="Galaxy-S25-Edge-Silver-Thin-Profile-Buttons-16" alt="Left side mmWave antenna and thin profile on the Galaxy S25 Edge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yRPgT7JZSbnDWsdgnDvG5Z.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Rumors pointed to the Galaxy S25 Edge earning a permanent spot in the Samsung Galaxy S lineup next year, phasing out the Plus model. After all, the Galaxy S25 Plus and Edge have the same chip, display, and general form factor — the latter is simply thinner. However, weak demand for this generation could put the company in a predicament.</p><p>Meanwhile, the report claims that Samsung is simultaneously doubling down on production of its upcoming foldables to get ahead of potential U.S. tariffs.</p><p>This report <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s25-edges-early-sales-seem-to-be-as-slim-as-the-phone-new-report-claims">corroborates another from early June</a> that previewed low demand for the Galaxy S25 Edge. It also seems to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/i-bought-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-but-no-one-else-did">align with negative consumer sentiment</a>, even from Samsung Galaxy fans.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The first feature spotted was an item called "SmartEdit." This feature appears to leverage Google's AI, at least its early code seems to allude to that. The tipster was able to surface an early explainer that reads, "SmartEdit helps you add, remove, or replace words easily with just your voice."</p><p>While this leverages some of Google's AI software, the early code comes with an important addition: your "edited text will be sent to Google and temporarily processed."</p><p>Continuing with AI, the tipster found clues about Gboard and Google's rumored exclusive AI working together. Gboard's explainer reiterates something we've seen before: "finish your task directly without app switching." Current speculation suggests Gboard could leverage this Pixel AI ability to capture your information, such as flight information, without user input.</p><p>Gboard could bring up its clipboard feature, letting users quickly tap to paste the info without "app switching."</p><h2 id="express-yourself-2">Express Yourself</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2619px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="chVHj3mxsVVcGRiwYNEkS" name="Gboard-emoji.jpg" alt="Gboard emoji and Emoji Kitchen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/chVHj3mxsVVcGRiwYNEkS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2619" height="1472" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The last major feature the tipster spotted involves Android's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gboards-emoji-kitchen-just-got-a-smarter-suggestion-bar">Emoji Kitchen</a>. The post states any emoji combinations users create will soon be available to save into a "favorites" list. This makes getting back to those moments of emoji brilliance that much easier without recreating the concoction.</p><p>These features under development will likely remain for a little while longer. It'll be worth keeping an eye out for any large Gboard updates in the future. Additionally, the publication states the discovered "SmartEdit" code <em>could be </em>an expansion of what's already available on Android currently. The Google AI ToS (terms of service) mentions could further this suspicion.</p><p>The exclusive Pixel AI feature mentioned for Gboard regards the recently rumored "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-sense-magic-cue-pixel-10-rebrand-rumored">Magic Cue</a>." Previously speculated to be named "Pixel Sense," and "Pixie" before that, Magic Cue is rumored to be intimately involved with all of your personal data should you allow it. In short, Magic Cue will be able to immediately understand a friend asking you for information and see if you have it in Gmail or another connected app.</p><p>Recent rumors state Google tucks this functionality under its "time-saving actions" for the AI assistant.

A major talking point is what Samsung's version lets users do: customize the "seismic intensity threshold." Users can have one set intensity during the day and another for the night. The company's early development lets users customize its seismic intensity from 1.0 to 4.0, likely based on the Richter Scale for detecting quakes.</p><p>Samsung itself recommends certain numbers, like 2.0 during the day and 3.0 at night, as sudden emergencies during your sleep can pose a severe danger.</p><p>The tipster states that if an earthquake is detected below your set threshold, Samsung's alerts will still produce a notification; however, it won't interrupt what you're doing. When an earthquake is detected, evidence shows users will receive a red "full-screen notification" alongside a warning sound.</p><h2 id="hazardous-situations-2">Hazardous Situations</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Samsung's Earthquake Warnings feature comes with great additions compared to Google's.

It highlights areas like China, where Google's software isn't prevalent, which could be Samsung's intended audience. One <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Merc_010/status/1935976240952791192">user on X</a> also mentioned trying to access Google's earthquake alerts before (being in a quake-prone region themselves), but they couldn't as it was a "region-locked" feature.</p><p>This feature seems in line for One UI 8's launch, but there's no clear indication for that, so just keep your eyes open.</p><p>Google's Android earthquake alerts were on our minds recently, as the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/wear-os/this-one-android-setting-wear-os-earthquakes-early-warning">rolled them out for Wear OS devices</a>. There was nothing inherently new with this update, other than its availability on your smartwatch. Users with these alerts active will see the earthquake's magnitude and their distance from its epicenter. Similar to what Google did for Android, it's bringing these Wear OS quake alerts to "high-risk" areas first.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

However, with the ongoing success of Motorola's Razr series, Samsung has a lot to prove with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a>.</p><p>Based on the leaks and rumors about the upcoming Galaxy Z Flip 7, we may finally get a phone that gives the Razr a run for its money. So, does that mean you should wait to buy the Z Flip 7, or are you better off going with last year's Flip or even the Razr Ultra? Let's break it down.</p><h2 id="a-cover-screen-worth-using-2">A cover screen worth using?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1420px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="45qixYcw9UkSSQ7FVBCmLV" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-7-leaked-render-3" alt="Leaked image of a blue Galaxy Z Flip 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/45qixYcw9UkSSQ7FVBCmLV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1420" height="799" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Alleged render of the Galaxy Z Flip 7. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks via Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of the most notable upgrades we've seen in the Galaxy Z Flip 7 is the updated design, complete with a larger cover screen. From the looks of it, the external display may span the entire top back cover, similar to the layout of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Motorola Razr Ultra</a>.</p><p>This is exciting because it should enhance the cover screen experience by giving users more screen real estate to work with. We don't officially know the exact dimensions, but it's rumored to be about 4 inches, which should be plenty of room for activities.</p><p>But most importantly, it should hopefully allow for a better app experience. Currently, Samsung only "officially" allows a select few <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-set-up-and-use-apps-on-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-cover-screen">apps on the cover screen</a>, while the rest have to be accessed through a separate panel after installing and setting up the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung/galaxy-z-flip-6-one-ui-7-beta-multistar-button">MultiStar module in Good Lock</a>.</p><p>It's a bit of a process to get it to work, and when it does, apps are confined to the rather limited 3.4-inch display of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>, which vertically squishes them down to a nearly unusable size.</p><p>With a larger cover screen, apps should have a little more room to breathe. Furthermore, the expanded cover screen could also hint at a revamped software experience, and hopefully, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/24-hours-using-only-the-motorola-razr-and-galaxy-z-flip-cover-screens">Samsung will follow Motorola's example</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-set-up-use-motorola-razr-cover-screen-apps">allow apps to work natively on the cover screen</a>.</p><h2 id="more-power-but-will-it-be-enough-2">More power, but will it be enough?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4031px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="EXS9zHrNktqt66hYFcsYGB" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-review-29.jpg" alt="Honkai: Star Rail on the Galaxy Z Flip 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EXS9zHrNktqt66hYFcsYGB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4031" height="2267" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There have been conflicting rumors about whether or not Samsung will use a Snapdragon or Exynos chip with the Galaxy Z Flip 7. As of late, things seem to be pointing to an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-z-flip-7-exynos-2500-chip-usage-rumored">Exynos 2500</a> being used in most, if not all, regions, including North America.</p><p>Given the history of Samsung's Exynos chips and consumer sentiment around them, this could put the Galaxy Z Flip 7 at a disadvantage, at least when compared to other flip phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Motorola Razr Ultra</a>. After all, it's often the case that Qualcomm chips are generally more powerful than Exynos, although it could be argued that Exynos chips are more efficient.</p><p>Since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phones</a> have limited space for batteries, this could be a respectable tradeoff, given the phone is expected to arrive with a meager 300mAh bump to battery capacity when compared to the 4,000mAh on the Galaxy Z Flip 6. That's still lower than the 4,700mAh battery of the Razr Ultra, but that may not matter if the chip is more efficient.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2149px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.31%;"><img id="pfyVzktcAoqKdPZy5xx7fc" name="samsung-exynos-chip-generic-hero.jpg" alt="Samsung Exynos chip mockup" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pfyVzktcAoqKdPZy5xx7fc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2149" height="1210" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Furthermore, it seems likely that the chip in the Galaxy Z Flip 7 will be more powerful than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> powering the Galaxy Z Flip 6, and it should provide a superior experience. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/exynos-2500-processor-cpu-performance-revealed-galaxy-z-flip-7/">Leaked benchmarks</a> indicate that the Galaxy Z Flip 7 is expected to achieve single- and multi-core scores of 2,012 and 7,563, respectively. They fall behind other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> devices, but that's likely due to the chip being underclocked to manage thermals in the flip phone chassis.</p><p>In fact, the scores are better than those of the Razr Ultra 2025, which received 1,743 and 6,714. The multi-core score outperforms past Snapdragon chips, but the single-core score lags behind some previous generations. It is possible that Motorola similarly underclocked the prime cores to manage heat, which tends to accumulate at the top half of flip phones.</p><p>Either way, the Razr Ultra performs very well in day-to-day use, and the Galaxy Z Flip 7 should perform similarly, if not better, thanks in part to the rumored (but likely) 12GB of RAM.

You don&apos;t get wireless charging support, for instance, and the 13R only offers four years of software support compared to the Pixel 9a&apos;s seven. On the other hand, the OnePlus phone has a better display, larger battery, and a more powerful chipset, so I&apos;d argue that it evens out.</p><p>All things said and done, this is a rare deal on a midrange masterpiece that could easily hold its own against the best devices from Samsung and Google. Is it worth $600?

I tested the OnePlus 13 for a month when it launched, and went back to the device several times over the course of 2025. I used all iterations of OxygenOS going back to the very first beta build that debuted back in 2015, and I'd like to think I know my way around the skin. So if you're just getting started with the OnePlus 13, here's how I set up my phone.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-set-up-the-pull-down-gesture"><span>Set up the pull-down gesture</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rKkATMGpDPeewmQc25WGwm" name="OnePlus 13" alt="OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rKkATMGpDPeewmQc25WGwm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>OxygenOS has plenty of annoyances, and one that ranks highly is the global search that shows up instead of the notification pane when you pull down anywhere on the screen. Thankfully, you can switch this back to the notification pane without too much of a hassle.</p><p>Just pull down anywhere after you set up the phone, and you'll get a dialog box asking if you'd like to use global search or access the notification pane.

This is similar to iOS, and while other Chinese manufacturers also do this — looking at you, Xiaomi — I'm not a fan of the split shade. I like having notifications and toggles in the same shade, and you can go back to this mode.</p><p>Just head to your phone settings, go to the Notifications & Quick Settings menu, select Quick Settings, and choose the Classic option. Doing so will switch the shade back to a unified style.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-never-miss-a-notification"><span>Never miss a notification</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="yLuA7eThbGpBUKAJCGvGwm" name="OnePlus 13" alt="OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yLuA7eThbGpBUKAJCGvGwm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of the best things about OxygenOS is the ability to wake screen whenever you get a notification.

I like the mode; it has good colors without going overboard with the saturation, and if you like better calibration, you can switch to the P3-D65 color gamut by selecting the Pro mode. And if you want vibrant colors with increased saturation, the Vivid mode is the one to choose.</p><p>There's also the option to manually adjust the color balance, so if you like the tonality to be on the warmer or cooler side, you can easily do so.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-mitigate-eye-strain"><span>Mitigate eye strain</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5jo2f9rmMuPpcEB8W3qpxm" name="OnePlus 13" alt="OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5jo2f9rmMuPpcEB8W3qpxm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The OnePlus uses a BOE panel with 2,160Hz PWM dimming, and it makes a genuine difference if you're switching from an iPhone, Pixel, or Galaxy device. If you're sensitive to PWM dimming, I'd recommend enabling the Ultra anti-flicker mode in the settings.</p><p>There's also a bedtime mode that automatically adjusts colors at night, enabling warmer hues to prevent blue light. I just set it to auto, but if you want a custom tint or schedule, you can easily configure it.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-unlock-the-highest-resolution"><span>Unlock the highest resolution</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="47KRE3sEqzntDKW4AxE2xm" name="OnePlus 13" alt="OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/47KRE3sEqzntDKW4AxE2xm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Similar to the last two years, the OnePlus 13 gets a resolution of 3168 x 1440. But to make the most out of the panel, you'll need to go into the settings and change the resolution manually — it's set to Standard (2376 x 1080) out of the box. But once you set it to High, it'll unlock the QHD+ resolution. Doing so uses more battery, so if you want to eke out battery life, I'd suggest toggling the Auto-select mode.</p><p>Similarly, you'll want to change the refresh rate to High to ensure the device enables 120Hz mode wherever possible. Most games are still locked to 60fps, but switching to 120Hz in daily use makes a huge difference.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-tailor-the-phone-just-the-way-you-like-it"><span>Tailor the phone just the way you like it</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PT7YZVJLhmmANavhg6vBwm" name="OnePlus 13" alt="OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PT7YZVJLhmmANavhg6vBwm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>OxygenOS always exceled at customizability, and that's no different with the OnePlus 13.

There's a search pill you can select to show at the bottom — just like on Pixels. You can also set up visual effects, and they make navigating the UI just that bit better.</p><p>There still isn't a way to disable the leftmost pane, and it is set to Google Discover by default — you don't get the option to use anything else. Other than that quibble, I don't have any issues with the home screen as such. OxygenOS does a good job with folders in general, and the ability to launch apps without having to expand a folder is a nice bonus.</p><p>In a similar vein, OnePlus did a thorough job overhauling the UI, and the animations are fluid out of the box. Even so, selecting Enhanced animations makes the interface that little bit smoother.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-adjust-lock-screen-settings"><span>Adjust lock screen settings</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="UbM3ZbqbqDj7WjLVtZdSvm" name="OnePlus 13" alt="OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UbM3ZbqbqDj7WjLVtZdSvm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The OnePlus 13 does a good job with lock screen customization as well, and you get the standard raise-to-wake mode.

Ray-Ban Meta glasses have already found their groove, so bringing Oakley into the smart eyewear scene feels like a natural next step. Oakley is known for gear that performs, and pairing that with Meta’s tech is a solid way to reach folks who want something that can keep up with their pace.</p><h2 id="oakley-s-entry-into-meta-s-smart-eyewear-ecosystem-2">Oakley's entry into Meta's smart eyewear ecosystem</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iVpUVNkTUVCzfYgwh6XFrK" name="oakley-meta-hstn-official-lifestyle-02" alt="Official lifestyle shots of a person wearing Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iVpUVNkTUVCzfYgwh6XFrK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The new specs (no pun intended) are pretty stacked. You get an Ultra HD (3K) camera that lets you film your workouts, tricks, or scenic rides totally hands-free. Built-in open-ear speakers let you blast your hype playlist or catch up on a podcast without getting tangled in wires.</p><p>And of course, it wouldn’t be a Meta collab without AI baked in. You can talk to it mid-activity—ask about the weather, the wind, or tell it to snap a video while you focus on not falling off your board.</p><p>The battery life is surprisingly solid, too. You get 8 hours of active use, 19 hours on standby, and the case adds another 48 hours on top. In a rush? A quick 20-minute charge juices them up to 50%.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div

Speculation suggests the gaming tablet could sport a "simple design." It's unclear what this could allude to, considering OnePlus has changed the design language from the Pad 2 to the Pad 3 (but only regarding its camera cutout).</p><p>More than that, the tipster claims the tablet will sport a screen within the 8-inch range.  It seems OnePlus could provide 3K resolution and deliver a 165Hz refresh rate, which would make games, like Zenless Zone Zero, incredibly smooth to the eye.</p><p>Curiously, users in the comments have started theorizing and questioning when this tablet could debut. There's nothing set in stone, but there's speculation we could see this OnePlus gaming tablet by the year's end or even early 2026.</p><h2 id="oneplus-is-juggling-devices-2">OnePlus is juggling devices</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="kRz7rTtnrWGzv5hZDCgsMN" name="Back of OnePlus Pad 3" alt="Back of OnePlus Pad 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kRz7rTtnrWGzv5hZDCgsMN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As far as design goes, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-2-review">OnePlus Pad 2</a> featured a circular camera cutout on its rear panel.

Earlier this week, the Chinese OEM unveiled a wide selection of devices aimed at being a little more cost-conscious for consumers. OnePlus is preparing to introduce the following devices: the OnePlus Nord 5 and the OnePlus Nord CE5, the OnePlus Buds 4, the OnePlus Pad Lite, and the OnePlus Watch 3 43mm.</p><p>The company stated its Pad Lite is like the flagship Pad 3, but more affordable.

I like what Nothing is doing with the software, and utilities like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/nothing-essential-space-ai-hub-what-pixel-screenshots-should-have-been">Essential Space</a> give its phones a distinct advantage.</p><p>Ahead of the July 1 unveil, Nothing is building interest in the device by slowly teasing details, such as the internals and design. The Phone 3 is confirmed to run the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4, a 4nm chipset that utilizes the Cortex X4 and A720 cores. While it is a good platform in its own right — Nothing is touting heady gains over the 8+ Gen 1 in the Phone 2 — it isn't the best that Qualcomm has to offer.</p><p>That honor still belongs to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>. Having used two dozen phones that feature the chipset, I can say with some confidence that it is faster than just about anything else on Android, and it even holds its own against the A18. Interestingly, Qualcomm went with an all-new custom core design this year, and the switch to the 3nm node means it has better efficiency. You miss out on both upgrades on the 8s Gen 4; it uses regular Cortex cores and is manufactured on a 4nm node.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5060px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="TACt38ZS8qetbw73t8mBKQ" name="iqoo-neo-10-1" alt="iQOO Neo 10 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TACt38ZS8qetbw73t8mBKQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5060" height="2850" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 debuted on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/iqoo-neo-10-review">iQOO Neo 10</a> last month, and having used it, I came away with the impression that it is a solid choice — for a mid-range device. That's why Nothing's decision to use it on the Phone 3 is puzzling; the manufacturer is clearly positioning the upcoming phone as a flagship, but it isn't including a flagship chipset.</p><p>Nothing is likely going to sell the Phone 3 in the vicinity of $800, and not including the best possible silicon puts the Phone 3 at a disadvantage against all the Snapdragon 8 Elite-powered devices of 2025, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x200-ultra-review">Vivo X200 Ultra</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-ultra-review">Xiaomi 15 Ultra</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi/poco-f7-ultra-review">POCO F7 Ultra</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Magic 7 Pro</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/iqoo-13-review">iQOO 13</a>. Both the iQOO 13 and POCO F7 Ultra cost significantly less than $800, and with either device available in regions Nothing is targeting (India and the U.K.), I don't see how the Phone 3 can stand out.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="mNFgGHHBctwRRfRAmW8eSC" name="Nothing Phone 3a Pro" alt="Nothing Phone 3a Pro next to Phone 3a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mNFgGHHBctwRRfRAmW8eSC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With such intense rivalry in the high-end segment, any vulnerabilities are going to be magnified, and Nothing's choice to go with the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 could potentially affect the device even before its launch. It isn't just about the cores either; the ISP makes a big difference these days, and with the Phone 3 touted to deliver better cameras, going with Qualcomm's best ISP would have made the device that much stronger.</p><p>And as much as I dislike generative AI features, that's clearly a key point of differentiation with most manufacturers these days, and having the best NPU would've made the Phone 3 stand out. Nothing counts enthusiasts as a key portion of its user base, and it is this audience that cares about the spec sheet more than most.</p><p>Of course, a phone is much more than its specs, and Nothing has shown in the past that it is able to deliver devices with good optimization even without using the best hardware. But I can't help but feel that the brand is being a bit disingenuous by calling the Phone 3 a true flagship — that clearly isn't the case.</p><p>I enjoyed using the Phone 2 when it came out, and the budget Phone 3a and 3a Pro this year. I'm intrigued by what the Phone 3 has to offer; I'll reserve judgement until I use the phone, but I wanted Nothing to deliver a device that's on the same lines as other flagships, and it's annoying that we aren't getting that.</p> ]]></dc:content>

As such, Honor says these features will drive the Magic V5's capabilities up to near PC-like levels. More information on these features will likely surface a little closer to launch.</p><p>However, Honor is shying away from the market, as it looks at direct competition with Samsung.</p><p>The post calls out Samsung's upcoming Galaxy Z Fold 7, labeling its upcoming Magic V5 as a "compelling alternative." Honor says its foldable leans on "cutting-edge design aspects, performance, and portability."</p><h2 id="human-centric-ai-2">Human-centric AI</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2640px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:22.73%;"><img id="zaFENeFtZA3uNVHF4V93Wn" name="honor-magic-v5-launch-announcement" alt="The Honor Magic V5 will launch on July 2 in China." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zaFENeFtZA3uNVHF4V93Wn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2640" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Honor)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While we await the Magic V5, Honor's recently started down <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/honor-unveils-global-ai-strategy-with-usd-ten-billion">its Alpha AI path</a>, which saw the company invent ~$10 billion.

The idea is to serve up an information-packed lock screen that keeps real-time updates front and center.</p><p>Currently, your Pixel gives you two flavors of At a Glance. There’s the standard version from the Google app, which is the same one you’ll see on plenty of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>. Then there’s the Pixel-only version baked into the Pixel Launcher, which dishes out smart, context-aware info across various categories.</p><p>According to Mishaal Rahman over at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-gemini-space-leak-3569136/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a> could be getting a big At a Glance makeover, possibly rebranded as Gemini Space.</p><h2 id="finance-and-sports-at-your-fingertips-2">Finance and sports, at your fingertips</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3357px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.21%;"><img id="wuDb9diC8S4fy8FSHuyDHX" name="pixel-6-at-a-glance-widget-lifestyle.jpg" alt="At A Glance widget on Google Pixel 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wuDb9diC8S4fy8FSHuyDHX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3357" height="1887" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The new version is supposed to go beyond weather and calendar information, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-at-a-glance-widget-could-help-you-follow-sports-scores-on-your-pixel">adding things like live sports scores</a> and finance updates right to your lock screen, making it way more useful at a glance.</p><p>Hints of this new feature first popped up in last month’s Android 16 QPR1 Beta 1, where a system config file called "Ambient Data" was spotted. And since it showed up in both Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 8 Pro firmware, it looks like this upgrade won’t be limited to just the Pixel 10.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:27.70%;"><img id="6zueDkTQ93HQLaXiXtdCbn" name="Gemini-Space-reference-on-a-Pixel-phone" alt="gemini space reference in the Android 16 QPR1 Beta 1 release" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6zueDkTQ93HQLaXiXtdCbn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="277" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Some extra digging turned up clues about something called an "Ambience Hub."

Digging through its code reveals direct mentions of Gemini Space, along with clear support for showing things like finance recaps and sports updates.</p><p>Interestingly, the Pixel Launcher’s At a Glance widget is supposedly getting those finance recaps and sports updates. Recent code <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/piel-at-a-glance-sports-finance/" target="_blank">spotted</a> in the Android System Intelligence app points to two Pixel-only upgrades in the works—Finance Recap for quick market snapshots and Sports, a long-brewing feature that’s finally getting ready to drop.</p><p>That said, Rahman makes it clear this is still just an informed guess, meaning there’s always a chance Gemini Space ends up being something completely different.</p> ]]></dc:content>

But since Samsung makes its own Exynos chips for Galaxy Watches, you'd think they'd get the same benefits.</p><p>Considering you can buy a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-affordable-galaxy-a16-5g-just-dropped-and-yet-its-already-17-percent-off-at-amazon">Galaxy A16 5G</a> for $100 less than a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a> and get six years of OS updates, it's not a matter of watches being too cheap to <em>deserve</em> support.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ssfNhouhvEsjaRSbqHv6LQ" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-3-march-2025-update" alt="The Google Pixel Watch 3 sitting on a bookshelf, showing the update screen: "Your watch is up to date; Android version: 15; Android security update: March 5, 2025"" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ssfNhouhvEsjaRSbqHv6LQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Even a cheap phone will have 3–4X the RAM and three or four more ARM Cortex cores than your typical smartwatch SoC. Samsung has more headroom and better thermal solutions with the A16 than a Galaxy Watch optimized for max battery life. And any new Wear OS feature added could imbalance the entire system.</p><p>Just in the past year, we've seen how Google had to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-wear-os-5-problems-force-pause">roll back Wear OS 5</a> and then fix major bugs with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/delayed-wear-os-5-1-update-mess-has-me-annoyed-and-looking-for-solutions">Wear OS 5.1</a>. Google <em>wants</em> to refresh its watches with new features at a quarterly cadence, but has trouble executing.</p><p>Maybe once Qualcomm delivers its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/qualcomms-next-wear-os-chipset-could-arrive-in-2025">new Snapdragon Wear chip</a> or Pixel Watches <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/upcoming-pixel-watches-could-play-it-safe-and-i-dont-like-it">switch to RISC-V</a>, they'll have the capacity to last longer. Plus, cutting off the Pixel Watch's 2018 Exynos 9110 chip frees Google to get more ambitious with Wear OS 6, making new buyers happier but leaving original customers in the lurch.</p><h2 id="do-you-care-how-long-your-wear-os-watch-lasts-2">Do you care how long your Wear OS watch lasts?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="PSFP25dcjLkVNy75gBUkjJ" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-3-Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-colorful-watch-faces" alt="The Google Pixel Watch 3 sitting beside the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra on a brown table, both with colorful watch faces." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PSFP25dcjLkVNy75gBUkjJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's a full spectrum of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a> in terms of software support. Mobvoi watches are still on Wear OS 4 and lack Google Assistant; OnePlus promises two OS updates and three years of security, but takes a year longer than Google to deliver to last-gen watches; and then there's Google and Samsung leading the charge.</p><p>Frankly, any smartwatch from 2022 or earlier will have significant downgrades from current models in terms of display quality, health sensors, and performance speed. So should customers be <em>expected</em> to upgrade so that Samsung and Google can evolve past old tech, or should they <em>expect</em> the right to get new features for four years?</p><p>As someone who usually gets the latest watch tech every year, I'm spoiled with instant access to new features, and therefore expect them. So I'm curious how much you (the reader) care about these updates.</p><p>Would you be upset if your Galaxy Watch 4 couldn't access Vascular Load, Running Coach, Antioxidant Index, and other tools from One UI 8 Watch? Or if your Pixel Watch 1 didn't get Material 3 Expressive, third-party watch face apps, dynamic theming, and battery optimizations from Wear OS 6?</p><p>Or are you okay with the expectation that you'll need to upgrade to a new watch every 2–3 years for major UI upgrades or Gemini?</p> ]]></dc:content>
