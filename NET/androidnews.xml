According to Woodward, nano banana, the Gemini app's imaging editing model, is the catalyst behind the 10 million-plus users who've started using its AI services. More than that, Woodward says nano banana has already edited over 200 million images for users in its short life in the app.</p><p>The post on X adds, "TPUs red hot. SRE pagers howling."</p><p>While there are "many prompts going viral around the world simultaneously," Woodward says, there's one in particular people are enjoying: the figurine prompt.</p><p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/GeminiApp/status/1962647019090256101">highlights a post</a> by its Gemini app account, which puts a spotlight on users being able to turn a photo of themself, and others, into figurines on a desk. The account also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/GeminiApp/status/1962647022068187208">gave an example prompt</a> for users looking to try it out for themselves. Google says Gemini's nano banana can turn a photo of you, your pet, and your family into a unique figurine‚Äîbox included and all‚Äîsitting on a desk.</p><h2 id="going-nano-bananas-2">Going (Nano) Bananas</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">üçåupdate:200M+ images edited10M+ people are new to @GeminiApp - welcome!TPUs red hotSRE pagers howling<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1963627742618165270">September 4, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>Google had a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-leans-on-google-deepmind-transformative-image-edits-update">major update drop for Gemini's photo editing</a> capabilities, which saw the AI lean on DeepMind. The built-in editor, "nano banana," lets the AI use a user's prompt for better image generation/editing. In short, users can blend photos, mix up designs, and more. For blending, users can tell Gemini to combine two separate photos into one, as if they were always like that.</p><p>Users can even let their imagination shine for selfies. With your prompt, Gemini can turn you into a space-walking astronaut, a rock star, or anything else you can think of. Mixing up designs is sort of like a continuous editing session with Gemini. Users can tell Gemini what to add to an empty room (for example) and continue to tweak its design. It's sort of like follow-up questions, but you're simply expanding and adding onto your ideas with the AI.</p> ]]></dc:content>

A Weather app has already been available on Pixel Watches since Wear OS 3 in 2022, but Google is now launching Pixel Weather on Pixel Watch models starting with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Pixel Watch 4</a>.</p><p>One of the major features here is that the Pixel Weather app on Pixel Watch brings the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-unveils-the-most-massive-android-redesign-ever">Material 3 Expressive design</a> to the app, even though the layout is similar to what's currently available on Wear OS. The app icon matches the phone version with the classic yellow sun on a blue background.</p><h2 id="pixel-weather-isn-t-just-for-phones-anymore-2">Pixel Weather isn't just for phones anymore</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DxbkxK7ruQxz3zgZJ4xwHm" name="pixel-weather-app-1" alt="Pixel Weather app on Pixel Watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DxbkxK7ruQxz3zgZJ4xwHm.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="h4FqEynfwhevcTesSig4Dm" name="pixel-weather-app-2" alt="Pixel Weather app on Pixel Watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h4FqEynfwhevcTesSig4Dm.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>In typical Material 3 Expressive fashion, the city view shows a large pill-shaped card with the current temperature, condition with an icon, and highs and lows in the card. Above the card, you see the city name and the current time. The background also reflects the weather, just like on the phone app.</p><p>Alongside the app, Google has also updated the watch face tiles for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-pixel-weather-app-just-got-a-handy-update-for-unit-measurements">Pixel Weather</a>. There are now three tiles available: one with temperature, high/low, and precipitation chance; one with sunrise/sunset times; and one with UV index. In all tiles, the time and city appear above the weather info. The publication also notes that watch face complications are coming.</p><p>There's no confirmed release date yet for the Pixel Weather app on Pixel Watch, but it is expected to arrive with the Pixel Watch 4 next month. Although Google has already started putting screenshots of Pixel Weather on the Play Store for Wear OS. It's also unclear what will happen to the old Weather app once Pixel Weather rolls out.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Its been rumored for a while that Samsung is looking to drop its base model in favor of the following lineup: Galaxy S26 Pro, Galaxy S26 Edge, and the Galaxy S26 Ultra. It <em>seems </em>like these models are lined up in the tipster's photo in that order, meaning the S26 Edge is in for a major change.</p><p>The tipster alleges the device could see a raised, horizontal camera bar with two camera lenses. As the X post points out, the design is oddly similar to what's been theorized for Apple's upcoming iPhone 17 series.</p><p>The other two devices may continue the design cues we've seen from the Galaxy S25 series. However, as 9to5 states, Samsung might plan for a better Qi2 experience with this new flagship series. There's no getting around the fact that the S25 series <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-support-qi2-wireless-charging">needs a case with the magnets</a> for its "Qi2 support" to work.

The brand launched three new midrange phones: the Motorola Edge 60 Neo, Moto G06, and Moto G06 Power. The former <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-edge-60-fusion-announced">rounds out the Motorola Edge 60 lineup</a>, while the latter two devices offer large displays and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-power-2025-review">long battery life on a budget</a>.</p><p>The phones are coming to Europe and global markets, but Motorola couldn't say whether they would make their way to the U.S. If prior launches are any indication, we probably won't see the Motorola Edge 60 Neo, Moto G06, or Moto G06 Power launch in North America, at least by those names.</p><p>I went hands-on with the Motorola Edge 60 Neo, Moto G06, and Moto G06 Power, and here's what you need to know about them.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Lenovo, which owns Motorola, provided travel and lodging for Innovation World 2025, but did not have any input in this article.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7dB7RQrybphFGmw8XFUVUh" name="Motorola-Edge-60-Neo-1" alt="The Motorola Edge 60 Neo in the hand and on display at IFA 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7dB7RQrybphFGmw8XFUVUh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Motorola Edge 60 Neo comes a year after the Edge 50 Neo, and retains a similar design and core specs to its predecessor. The big change is a chip upgrade, as the Edge 60 Neo is now powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 7400 chipset. However, it's unclear whether performance will be materially improved compared to the Dimensity 7300 platform that powered the Edge 60 Neo.</p><p>The chip enables <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a>, Gemini, and Circle to Search features, as well as AI-focused camera optimizations.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9kHDcR99U35qpL9UneUUSh" name="Motorola-Edge-60-Neo-5" alt="The Motorola Edge 60 Neo in the hand and on display at IFA 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9kHDcR99U35qpL9UneUUSh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The display is still impressive for the price point. It's the same 6.4-inch pOLED display panel from last year's Edge 50 Neo. The screen still supports 3,000 nits of peak brightness and HDR10+ support ‚Äî both of which are excellent for interested Edge 60 Neo buyers, as these are excellent for a phone that's this affordable.</p><p>Motorola improved the durability of the Edge 60 Neo this year, adding IP69 dust and water-resistance, which takes IP68 to the next level. IP69 adds protection against high-pressure and high-temperature water tests, meaning in theory, your Edge 60 Neo could survive a dishwasher run (don't do that). It's kind of a gimmick, but more durability is always welcomed. On that front, the display covering is now Gorilla Glass 7i, up from Gorilla Glass 3 on the Edge 50 Neo.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LCDeWLEcyTQrPVFx9nyHfh" name="Motorola-Edge-60-Neo-8" alt="The Motorola Edge 60 Neo in the hand and on display at IFA 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LCDeWLEcyTQrPVFx9nyHfh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Rounding out the list of upgrades is larger battery.

There's also 15W wireless charging support.</p><p>There are no camera upgrades on this year's Motorola Edge 60 Neo ‚Äî on the back is a triple-camera system with a 50MP main sensor, 13MP ultrawide, and 10MP telephoto lens.

The company continues that trend with the Lenovo Yoga Tab, a mid-range tablet, and the Lenovo Idea Tab Plus, a budget productivity tablet. Both arrive this month following their official reveal at Lenovo Innovation World 2025.</p><p>I went hands-on with the Yoga Tab and Idea Tab Plus, and they're Android 15 tablets with specific users in mind. The Lenovo Yoga Tab is creator-focused, down to the high-resolution display and preloaded Adobe Creative Suite software.

However, the Lenovo Yoga Tab aims to meet creators at the $550 price point, undercutting both premium and cheaper options, such as the base Galaxy Tab S11 and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-3-review">OnePlus Pad 3</a>.</p><p>The highlight of the experience is the display. I think the 11.1-inch panel is the perfect size for a basic tablet. The screen uses LTPS LCD technology, and while it's not OLED, it'll look better and feel more responsive than the old LCDs you may be used to. The resolution stands out at 3.2K, helping the Yoga Tab double down on its creative focus.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ntGBTmnvvMceazrRGie8e5" name="Lenovo-Yoga-Tab-2" alt="The Lenovo Yoga Tab connected to a keyboard folio at IFA 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ntGBTmnvvMceazrRGie8e5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The resolution makes the Yoga Tab ideal for drawing, photo editing, or video editing, and it looks great in person. It'll even be able to handle color-accurate work, as Lenovo says it covers 98% of the DCI-P3 color gamut. It's not often you see a tablet validated for color accuracy, especially at this price point. The 144Hz refresh rate will be beneficial for basic responsiveness and light gaming.</p><p>I had no issues with the quality of the Lenovo Yoga Tab screen, but the brightness capabilities stuck out to me as a potential concern. The tablet can only hit 800 nits of maximum brightness, which is half that of the Galaxy Tab S11 series. Granted, the Yoga Tab is cheaper, although some creatives might find they need that extra brightness, especially when outdoors.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="UMxD5xt93ueCRmr9m8gPY5" name="Lenovo-Yoga-Tab-5" alt="The Lenovo Yoga Tab connected to a keyboard folio at IFA 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UMxD5xt93ueCRmr9m8gPY5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Under the hood is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> processor paired with up to 12GB of RAM and up to 256GB of storage. Originally, I wished Lenovo equipped the Yoga Tab with the better <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> chip, but the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 actually makes sense for this price point.</p><p>Lenovo touts 20 TOPs of NPU power, but many of the tablet's AI features rely on cloud processing anyway. Lenovo's suite of AI features includes those we've come to expect from mobile devices in 2025, like generative text editing and sketch-to-image generation.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JcqWJE8w6m5KSLMTPsxj85" name="Lenovo-Yoga-Tab-1" alt="The Lenovo Yoga Tab connected to a keyboard folio at IFA 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JcqWJE8w6m5KSLMTPsxj85.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The tablet comes with Adobe Creative Suite pre-installed, plus a free trial, which is a nice touch. However, being that Adobe products are heavily reliant on subscriptions, it doesn't add much extra value to your Yoga Tab purchase. You get a two-month free trial of Adobe Lightroom and Adobe Express, plus a three-month free trial of Perplexity Pro.</p><p>All told, I came away from my brief hands-on with the Yoga Tab pretty impressed ‚Äî it's a thin, premium-feeling tablet with a few tweaks specifically designed with creators in mind.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-lenovo-idea-tab-plus"><span>Lenovo Idea Tab Plus</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="gucY8J75vpvxiiF7QEtn5h" name="Lenovo-Idea-Tab-Plus-3" alt="The Lenovo Idea Tab Plus at IFA 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gucY8J75vpvxiiF7QEtn5h.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Idea Tab Plus is a slightly larger but cheaper <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> tablet. This 12.1-inch tablet starts at just $270, which is much lower than many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">best Android tablets</a>. At this price point, you're looking at a basic device and expect a few compromises, which is why Lenovo is positioning the Idea Tab Plus toward basic productivity and content consumption.</p><p>Notably, it has the same great in-hand feel as the Yoga Tab, with an aluminum chassis and a thickness of only 6.29mm at its thinnest point. The bigger display is a basic LCD panel with a 2.5K resolution ‚Äî lower than the Yoga Tab but still more than suitable for everyday use. The refresh rate tops out at 90Hz, and the brightness can only reach 800 nits peak.</p><p>For what it's worth, even the budget Idea Tab Plus manages to grab 96% of the DCI-P3 color space, which is pretty impressive.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ufRrHbftHkmuCNejsuuy7h" name="Lenovo-Idea-Tab-Plus-7" alt="The Lenovo Idea Tab Plus at IFA 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ufRrHbftHkmuCNejsuuy7h.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You might not be able to do photo editing or video editing on the Idea Tab Plus due to hardware limitations, but the display itself is pretty good for color-accurate work. The processor is the 6nm MediaTek Dimensity 6400, which resides firmly in mid-range territory. I didn't notice any lag or general slowness while playing around with the Idea Tab Plus.</p><p>However, it's unlikely to win many benchmarks or crush demanding tasks, even with up to 12GB of RAM onboard.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="a88i7urYDTrQSaF9Bezuhf" name="Lenovo-Idea-Tab-Plus-2" alt="The Lenovo Idea Tab Plus at IFA 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a88i7urYDTrQSaF9Bezuhf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While there are a handful of cost-cutting measures taken to make the Idea Tab Plus more affordable, there are also a few neat perks that come with this tablet.

The increased cover panel gives it much better versatility, and while Samsung still doesn't allow the use of apps, it's easy to get around that limitation.</p><p>Interestingly, Samsung used its in-house Exynos 2500 chipset on all global models of the Galaxy Z Flip 7, deviating from Qualcomm silicon. While recent Exynos designs have been panned (for good reason), Samsung LSI seems to have learned from its mistakes.</p><p>The Flip 7 still isn't in the same league as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a>, Galaxy S25, and other regular phones, but it is quite decent in the context of foldables. The inherent nature of the Flip 7 doesn't allow the inclusion of a sizeable thermal management layer, and as a consequence, it doesn't hold up anywhere as well in demanding use cases.</p><p>However, this is the case with all foldables, and the Flip 7 has a decent showing against the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x-fold-5-review">Vivo X Fold 5</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">Find N5</a>, even if it doesn't quite measure up in some areas.</p><h2 id="more-cpu-cores-than-you-ll-know-what-to-do-with-2">More CPU cores than you'll know what to do with</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Lv9zZPspiFNQmLc54eR3NP" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-7-Review-9" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Lv9zZPspiFNQmLc54eR3NP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Exynos 2500 is built on Samsung Semiconductor's 3nm Gate All Around (GAA) node, which is interesting in its own right as TSMC is still reliant on FinFET, with the Taiwanese fab not switching to GAA until the 2nm revision. With the Exynos 2500, the move to 3nm brings considerable efficiency gains, and that's borne out in everyday use; the foldable has a bigger 4,300mAh battery, and it manages to last up to a day with medium use ‚Äî something that just wasn't possible on the Z Flip 6.</p><p>While it misses out on custom cores, Samsung LSI went with the latest Arm cores, and there are ten in total, two more than what you get on most mobile chipsets. I think ten cores are overkill, but Samsung clearly wanted to deliver better performance out of the workhorse cores.</p><p>As a result, the Exynos 2500 sees one Cortex X5 core clocked at 3.3GHz, and it is joined by two Cortex A725 cores at 2.74GHz, alongside five A725 running at 2.36GHz. You get the usual dual-core Cortex A520 at 1.8GHz to round out the design.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7</p></th><th  ><p>Vivo X200 Pro</p></th><th  ><p>Vivo X Fold 5</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Geekbench 6 (single-core)</strong></p></td><td  ><p>1857</p></td><td  ><p>2908</p></td><td  ><p>2381</p></td><td  ><p>2184</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Geekbench 6 (multi-core)</strong></p></td><td  ><p>6479</p></td><td  ><p>9452</p></td><td  ><p>7175</p></td><td  ><p>6330</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Geekbench AI (Quantized Score)</strong></p></td><td  ><p>3401</p></td><td  ><p>3767</p></td><td  ><p>2436</p></td><td  ><p>3326</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Geekbench testing shows that having more cores doesn't actually make a difference; the multi-core score is lower than the Snapdragon 8 Elite and Dimensity 9400, only outmatching the older Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. Similarly, the single-core result is among the lowest I've seen on any device, with even the Dimensity 8400-toting mid-range POCO X7 Pro coming close (1573).</p><p>Much like Google with its Tensor platform, it's clear that Samsung LSI was focused on delivering better gains than previous generations of Exynos designs rather than measuring up to what Qualcomm and MediaTek are doing in this category. While the Exynos 2500 doesn't score well in synthetic workloads, it has a much better showing in regular use. I didn't see much in the way of slowdowns or lag, and it just wasn't a problem in the month I used the foldable.</p><p>Samsung did a good job optimizing the hardware, and even though it may not be the best mobile platform by a long shot, it is definitely better than earlier Exynos models.</p><h2 id="a-gpu-upgrade-that-actually-makes-sense-2">A GPU upgrade that actually makes sense</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5239px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iRGEQeAQqbmMxSrXCj85Z5" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-gba-sp-6" alt="Mobapad controllers attached to 3D Printed mount for Galaxy Z Flip 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iRGEQeAQqbmMxSrXCj85Z5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5239" height="2947" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Exynos 2500 features an AMD RDNA 3-based Xclipse 950 GPU, and it has noticeable gains over preceding models.

Overheating and aggressive thermal throttling were a mainstay on earlier Exynos models, and that's thankfully not an issue on the Exynos 2500; the Flip 7 didn't overheat even in extended gaming sessions, and throttling was nowhere as pronounced.</p><p>Even though the hardware isn't the best you can get today, I enjoyed using the Galaxy Z Flip 7. Exynos 2500 isn't anywhere as limiting to use, and that alone is noteworthy. It's evident that Samsung doesn't want to rely entirely on Qualcomm when it comes to its high-end devices, and the changes to Exynos 2500 are meaningful. It will be interesting to see how Samsung can iterate on the design next year, but this is a good start.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The post states this integration with Sonos Voice Control will give users the ability to "switch lights on or off, dim or brighten, and activate scenes with their voice." Regarding lights, the email to Android Central earlier today (Sep 4) states users can adjust the brightness and color temperature of their Philips Hue lights with Voice Control.</p><p>This update will also bring smart plug control capabilities via mic-enabled Sonos products.</p><p>Philips Hue highlights a privacy-focused update between it and Sonos. The company states your voice is "processed entirely on the device." It says what you're saying is not sent to the cloud for processing and that there's no "recording," nor is an internet connection required to utilize Voice Control. Nathan Hart, senior product manager at Sonos, adds, "We built Sonos Voice Control to make controlling your music with your voice faster and easier than ever before, all with the privacy of your data staying right on your speaker."</p><p>This update is looking at a September launch in U.S. English and French for users worldwide. However, Philips Hue states Voice Control will skip out on China, and it's unclear if users in the region will see it in the future.</p><h2 id="sonos-philips-hue-partner-2">Sonos & Philips Hue partner</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Q4pRhV7ncQ6A7mdcHSgFQP" name="Sonos-Ace-in-hand.jpg" alt="Carrying Sonos Ace headphones from headband." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Q4pRhV7ncQ6A7mdcHSgFQP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Sonos had a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/sonos-ace-dual-listening-truecinema-beefier-sound-realistic-update">huge update earlier this year</a>, but for its Ace headphones for the home.

For example, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Processor-ProScaler-Manufacturer/dp/B0DYVMMM8C/"><strong>grab the ultra-sleek Galaxy S25 Edge unlocked for just $699 at Amazon</strong></a> right now. That's just $50 more than the Galaxy S25 FE, and I'd argue that the Edge is a much better phone (if you don't mind taking a hit in battery life, of course).¬†</p><p>On the other hand, the Galaxy S25 FE <em>has </em>introduced some upgrades that make the phone stand out from the crowd, and just looking at the specs, it seems to be the best FE phone that Samsung has produced in years. Is it the ultimate flagship killer? It's too soon to say, but I certainly wouldn't buy the device without a good deal attached.¬†</p> ]]></dc:content>

That's a very broad term for components that are also used for a lot of other things, but it kind of fits here.</p><p>Most health sensors either emit light or detect light (or both if they're the expensive kind). That's because of all the things you can do with light, and two of the most interesting things are included on many wearable devices: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-can-measure-blood-oxygen-saturation-levels">blood oxygen level (SpO2)</a> monitoring and heart rate detection.</p><p>How can light tell me when my heart beats and how rich my blood is with oxygen?

Light is made of electromagnetic particles (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://quantumatlas.umd.edu/entry/photons/" target="_blank">photons</a>) that are emitted at a certain frequency, causing them to fill many parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. It's fascinating, and I encourage anyone interested to search out more details.</p><p>Our eyes can see light between about 400nm (blue) and 700nm (red) in that spectrum, and the lower wavelengths are commonly called ultraviolet, and the upper end is called infrared.</p><p>No two people see light the same way. For example, my blue shirt is blue to me, but that color is not the same as what you see. It's "blue" because of the wavelengths of visible light it reflects, and we learned what "blue" means to our eyes when we were young. "Blue" will change as we age, but so will our concept of what blue means.</p><p>Machines aren't like that. A box of properly calibrated sensors "sees" exactly the same color of blue. That's how any of this is possible ‚Äî the sensors know what to look for, and it will be the same from product to product.</p><p>The two important bits here are light outside of the spectrum people can see, and that sensors will "see" things the same way.</p><h2 id="the-process-2">The process</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="f3Pn93oK9ZYwSQVWqfCEuJ" name="Garmin-Forerunner-970-ecg-sinus-rhythm" alt="The Garmin Forerunner 970 showing an ECG reading with Sinus Rhythm data." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f3Pn93oK9ZYwSQVWqfCEuJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'll use SpO2 reading as an example to illustrate how this can work, but methods such as heart rate detection and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-exec-health-forum-glucose-monitoring-highlighted" target="_blank">glucose monitoring</a> can also be implemented using the same principles.</p><p>Inside your wearable, there are tiny LEDs that shine on the thin skin of your wrist. You've probably seen them blinking green, but the two used for SpO2 measurement are <strong>red</strong> and <em><strong>infrared</strong></em><em> </em>(light you can't see that penetrates solids like your skin differently). Those LEDs blink at a specific interval, and some of the light they emit goes through your skin and into the tiny blood vessels.</p><p>There is a pair of dedicated photodiodes that gather the light reflected through the skin from those blood vessels while trying to block the light that doesn't go into your skin.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="c4T7xJpM3uxXn5Xzh9WkHS" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-3-sensors" alt="Close-up of the Google Pixel Watch 3's bottom sensor array" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/c4T7xJpM3uxXn5Xzh9WkHS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin absorb light differently.

Hemoglobin that has been stripped of its oxygen does the opposite, absorbing more red light and reflecting less of it to the photodiodes.</p><p>The computer inside your wearable knows how much of each type of light was sent, based on its intensity. It also knows how much was reflected thanks to the photodiodes that measure it. It can then calculate what percentage of the hemoglobin in your blood is oxygenated based on the difference.</p><p>It's a tough idea to wrap your head around at first, but it's really just simple math at this point. A certain amount goes in, and a certain amount comes back. Calculate the difference and have the software make the number meaningful.</p><p>It's also the same way those little gadgets that doctors or nurses put on the tip of your finger to get SpO2 readings are used, but those are checked regularly and discarded<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ask-jerry-are-wearables-ready-to-be-medical-devices-yet"> if they lose calibration</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="rRqhJfgismGivjVXBGTjuf" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-BioActive-sensor" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic's bottom BioActive sensor with green, red, and blue lights activated when testing your skin for antioxidants." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rRqhJfgismGivjVXBGTjuf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>LEDs and photodiodes are also used for heart rhythm, heartbeat, glucose monitoring, and most anything that involves measuring your blood without actually sampling it. That's because specific things in your blood react to different light wavelengths differently.</p><p>You can combine this with what's called a Photoplethysmography (PPG for short, which measures volume based on size changes or your finger or wrist) sensor and a component that measures electricity to measure blood volume and electrical signals, and the time it takes them to travel to and from your heart. This can provide an ECG reading or determine your blood pressure.</p><p>Yes, if your wearable can do one of these things, then it is capable of doing the other, even if it's not programmed to do it.</p><p>These ideas aren't new, and they aren't only used to monitor your health from your ring or watch. However, making the components small enough and using less power was what it took to bring them to your wearable. Remember, you could also measure your heartbeat using many older Galaxy S phones because they had more room for the parts.</p><p>In the end, everything turns into math and numbers when you're a computer. Writing the software to make those numbers mean something is the hard part!</p> ]]></dc:content>

The Korean OEM announced this week that it has developed new features in collaboration with health brands to help users access virtual healthcare when needed.</p><p>"The updates include new virtual visits with doctors through Find Care in partnership with HealthTap, inclusion of Walgreens in Health Records' prescription tracking, and a fresh guided fitness program from iFIT," the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsungmobilepress.com/feature-stories/samsung-health-expands-seamless-access-to-care-anytime-anywhere/">press release added.</a></p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YnBYWc6SaY9bR4bK9mHUcW" name="Samsung-health-features-update" alt="Samsung brings virtual health care right to the app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YnBYWc6SaY9bR4bK9mHUcW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>To break things down further, the FindCare feature on the Health app will basically match you with virtual doctors, who are available either on the same day/week,  when you don't have the time for an in-person appointment or when your doctor isn't available at the drop of a hat.</p><p>It's a great alternative for those days you'd rather skip the Google symptom rabbit hole and just ask a pro for help. Samsung says users can also review upcoming appointments and basically text their doctor between video visits. If new symptoms start to develop or you need to get diagnostic tests done, FindCare has you covered.</p><p>Additionally, Samsung's Health Records feature will now be able to link up with Walgreens pharmacies (U.S. pharmacy chain), making it much easier to keep tabs on your prescriptions, check out past meds, and just generally stay on top of your health routine ‚Äì all within the app.</p><p>Plus, you can easily add your prescription info from Health Records to the medication tracker, so you don't have to go hunting for your doctor's prescription.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CNFEsF8R8aG7BJUiZccGnK" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-ui-8-beta-1-running-together" alt="The Together feature in the Samsung Health app on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CNFEsF8R8aG7BJUiZccGnK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Finally, fitness enthusiasts also get a little something out of this update. The company is also rolling out premium fitness content so you stay on top of your fitness goals, with guided workouts.</p><p>Much like Apple's Fitness Plus, you can find "high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and Pilates to recovery routines, users can access videos, organized into categories like trending workouts and seasonal recommendations," Samsung added. That said, these new features start rolling out on Sept.8 on the Samsung Health App, helping users access care whenever they need it.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Another new feature is Highlight videos, letting you create clips with phrases like "Mom" and "Paris," after which it selects photos and videos, adds music, and builds a video.</p><p>Other features like collage, Cinematic photos, and Animations will also live in the Create tab.</p><p>Google says the new Create tab and photo-to-video powered by Veo 3 are now available to U.S. users. There's no word yet on when these features will roll out to other regions, but it should be sooner rather than later.</p> ]]></dc:content>

I have no idea how this thing is already <em>two years old</em>, but it's taken that time for me to amass a significant number of truly intriguing mixed reality games that are laying the groundwork for smart glasses gaming.</p><p>While we're expecting the first major commercial pair of smart glasses with a display <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-reportedly-low-sales-expectations-project-hypernova-smart-glasses-report">to debut this month</a>, the latest batch of rumors point to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-4">Meta Quest 4</a> looking a lot more like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/the-quest-4-might-slip-to-2027-but-meta-could-unveil-a-lighter-model-next-year-instead">a pair of tethered smart glasses</a> than a VR headset. That's excellent news for mixed reality games, which will be even more fun with lighter, slimmer headwear.</p><p>Meta Quest developers creating mixed reality apps are catering to gamers today and in the future. When smart glasses have the display and capability to run games, they'll be running many of the same types of games we're playing on Meta Quest 3 today, all without the bulk of a VR headset.</p><h2 id="banners-bastions-2">Banners & Bastions</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3YSkFsAZqdscgj7h8Ut9q4" name="banners-and-bastions-official-mixed-reality-screenshot" alt="Looking at the half-globe play space in mixed reality in the game Banners & Bastions on a Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3YSkFsAZqdscgj7h8Ut9q4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1440" height="810" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Banners & Bastions is a new bite-sized roguelike real-time strategy game from the creators of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/airspace-defender/7523170214434197">Airspace Defender</a>. Like that game, everything takes place in a "half snow globe" of sorts, placed conveniently on your lap. You can move this half-globe anywhere you want, so it's just as good a tabletop board game as it is a compact lap game you can play on a plane.</p><p>The gameplay is a bit similar to Steam favorite <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/688420/Bad_North_Jotunn_Edition/">Bad North</a>, but with several different recent roguelike gameplay trends blended in. Each level begins with a preview of the number and type of enemies that will appear, as well as each spawn point's estimated movement direction (handy for putting up walls).</p><p>Players choose units from a random collection of cards that appear on screen, tying into the roguelike nature of the game. You've got a finite amount of money to spend on units, so it's uncommon to buy more than 1-2 cards each turn. Units can be placed anywhere on the map and moved at any time, so while it's important to plan ahead, you can always move things around during combat.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w5Vcdv9qMAo" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Levels are completed in a linear fashion and awarded the traditional 3-star mobile score model. Stars can be used to unlock a sizable skill tree, and you'll unlock new cards and units as you progress in the game. Plus, emergency powers like raining down meteors or calling up reserve soldiers can be used to help keep your units intact between rounds.</p><p>The real draw of playing this in mixed reality is the degree of control you have over the action. The game is hand-tracking-only, which makes it far more convenient to play than most VR games since you only need to put the headset on and launch the game. Hand tracking is phenomenal these days. Even my son, who has historically hated hand tracking because it used to be very finicky, found Banners & Bastions' hand tracking to be super effective.</p><p>Building a mixed reality game that relies on hands instead of controllers ensures that, in a few years, smart glasses with displays and game-ready hardware will be able to play this kind of game on the go with no issue. It's so much better than squinting and struggling to tap the right unit on a phone screen. I also deeply appreciate the game's quick levels, which typically take only a few minutes each to complete, making it a perfect fit for portable gaming.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="0c17f65a-a2a9-4c0f-a3d0-c4bb7ce4568b" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$9.99 on Meta Quest" data-dimension48="$9.99 on Meta Quest" href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/banners-bastions/8387152738076399/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:406px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:99.75%;"><img id="CzZYsyiWqanzwoANRJABeN" name="banners-and-bastions-meta-quest-thumbnail" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CzZYsyiWqanzwoANRJABeN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="406" height="405" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>Protect your kingdom in glorious mixed reality with this excellent minimalist roguelike strategy game that prioritizes your time over extensive stats or town building.</p><p><a href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/banners-bastions/8387152738076399/" data-dimension112="0c17f65a-a2a9-4c0f-a3d0-c4bb7ce4568b" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$9.99 on Meta Quest" data-dimension48="$9.99 on Meta Quest" data-dimension25=""><strong>$9.99 on Meta Quest</strong></a></p></div><h2 id="mythic-realms-2">Mythic Realms</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bCmvvSveRUeCmC58MijqGm" name="mythic-realms-official-screenshot-mixed-reality-skeletons" alt="Fighting little skeletons in mixed reality on a Meta Quest 3 in the game Mythic Realms" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bCmvvSveRUeCmC58MijqGm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1440" height="810" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Mythic Realms is one of the most full-fledged mixed reality games I've played to date. While it starts off as a seemingly simple mixed reality game where you battle monsters in your own physical room, you quickly learn that this game isn't just a combat simulator.</p><p>Rather, this is a full roguelike RPG in the vein of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bethsoft.blade">The Elder Scrolls: Blades</a>. In fact, the gameplay loop is incredibly similar to that title, down to the concept of heading out on quests to gather resources and money to rebuild the town you call home. From blacksmiths who will improve your equipment to daily random events that'll keep you coming back to see what's happening, there's always something fun to do.</p><p>I actually audibly gasped when I realized the depth of the game, as many similar mixed reality titles with fantasy combat and randomized room layouts often just focus on combat and little else.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ojUhCPRdd5E" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>The town itself is fully virtual reality, so while that portion would need some adjustment to work properly on mixed reality glasses, I could see the company adapting the town concept to a diorama size that's a bit more manageable in mixed reality. I really enjoy seeing the town in VR, though, so it feels excellent in its current configuration for Meta Quest 3 and 3S headsets.</p><p>The way Mythic Realms transforms your playspace ‚Äî even if you only have a small bedroom with very little walking space ‚Äî is nothing short of incredible. Doors and windows become portals to another world, letting you see "outside" to a place that otherwise might not exist. Even the ceiling is replaced by open sky, which is peaceful and lovely until a fire-breathing dragon inevitably comes along and ruins your day.</p><p>But while the visuals are impressive enough, it's the gameplay loop that keeps bringing me back. I love the concept of a roguelike that mixes battle, crafting, and harvesting mechanics into one game. Every other roguelike I've ever played always just focuses on combat, while Mythic Realms offers plenty of combat-free situations throughout each run.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="1692484b-dc89-4f78-88c7-e5837af1b2e9" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$19.99 on Meta Quest" data-dimension48="$19.99 on Meta Quest" href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/mythic-realms/8364993590228690/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:406px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:99.75%;"><img id="TsVDiNQw6fHcUzXfTTJpVD" name="mythic-realms-official-artwork-meta-quest-thumbnail" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TsVDiNQw6fHcUzXfTTJpVD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="406" height="405" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>Transform your room into a lifesize roguelike game, complete with combat, fishing, hunting, mining, and more.

Other Wear OS watches won't get the update for some time, and trying out dozens of custom watch faces only made it clearer how exciting an exclusive feature this is.</p><p>After restricting old, battery-guzzling watch faces in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> with Watch Face Format (WFF), Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/wear-os/wear-os-6-will-bring-facer-back-onto-android-watches">worked with Facer</a> and other apps on a solution: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/05/whats-new-in-watch-faces.html">Watch Face Push API</a>.</p><p>With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a>, each watch face app gets one "slot" in your watch's favorites menu, visible by tapping and holding the display. Pick a watch face in the mobile app, and it pushes onto that slot. Your watch's storage isn't cluttered with old faces because your latest pick overwrites the old one.</p><p>You can use as many watch face apps as are compatible with Wear OS 6, but since most of them require a subscription for the best faces, you'll probably want to stick with just one. So, I looked through the options in Facer, TIMEFLIK, WatchMaker, and Pujie to see which stood out.</p><h2 id="facer-2">Facer</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div

Premium: $40/year or $5/month</strong></p><p>Facer is crammed with unofficial faces for popular brands like Pok√©mon, Totoro, Zelda, and Star Wars. However, Facer also has official brand partners, including SpongeBob, Garfield, Barbie, Star Trek, and Tetris, as well as "Watchmaker" faces designed to mimic luxury watch faces. You'll find plenty of high-quality designs to tempt you, along with the more amateurish ones.</p><p>The best aspect of Facer is that each face has a "power impact" rating, which warns you if it will affect your watch's battery life. You can also tap a Sun/Moon icon to swap between the active and AOD layout, checking in advance if the latter isn't too battery-intensive.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="VB5o2MMeTGzk37V4zFvu7m" name="Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-Facer-Borderlands" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic showing a custom Borderlands watch face from Facer, sitting next to a Galaxy phone showing the Facer app, with information about the watch face's "Power Impact" and ambient mode look." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VB5o2MMeTGzk37V4zFvu7m.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Facer has a wide range of Wear OS 6-compatible faces, and at least 100 are free if you want to try the app out without committing to Premium; considering Samsung and Google have about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/wear-os/we-weighed-galaxy-vs-pixel-watch-for-best-wear-os-watch-faces">60 and 30 official faces</a>, respectively, that's nothing to sneeze at ‚Äî even if the best options are paid.</p><p>There's also the Facer Creator tool, where you can create your own custom designs; it's meant for publishing faces for people to download or buy, but you can simply save your designs to your account's "My Designs" folder and upload them to your watch.</p><h2 id="watchmaker-2">WatchMaker</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="T26PXfDGk8TVchJAuVgWwn" name="Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-WatchMaker-classic-face" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic on a person's wrist, showing a custom watch face from WatchMaker with a black, classic-style look." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/T26PXfDGk8TVchJAuVgWwn.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="vJX5tFoKo7Ew2mBWq8X3xn" name="Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-WatchMaker-face-Warossa" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic on a person's wrist, showing a custom watch face from the WatchMaker app imitating a Warossa watch." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vJX5tFoKo7Ew2mBWq8X3xn.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="oqbyiYPwSpsWRAqN5yXX5o" name="Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-WatchMaker-face-samsung-gear-s3" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic on a person's wrist, showing a custom watch face from the WatchMaker app of a Samsung Gear S3 watch." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oqbyiYPwSpsWRAqN5yXX5o.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p><strong>WatchMaker VIP: $20/year or $5/month</strong></p><p>WatchMaker has hundreds of thousands of WFF faces, though only 30 free ones at any one time.

In a press release, the company states consumers will find a 7.2-inch FHD Plus display; however, the 60 Ultra rocks TCL's new NXTPAPER 4.0 technology. It seems like the new 60 Ultra will join the likes of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/tcl-nxtpaper-4-fixes-one-of-the-technologys-biggest-hidden-issues">TCL's NXTPAPER 11 Plus tablet</a> with this enhanced, seven-core display tech.</p><p>This 4.0 screen tech offers a natural light display with zero flickering, blue light purification, no reflection, anti-glare, and more. TCL claims its NXTPAPER 4.0 is natural and should give the feeling as though you're staring at the real world, sans any digital displays.</p><p>This display can also "switch to warmer tones" once night falls to create a more comfortable experience that evolves as the day does. Moreover, it may also help users get to sleep better as the lack of blue light won't mess with their circadian rhythm.</p><h2 id="nxtpaper-cameras-ai-2">NXTPAPER cameras & AI</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:150.00%;"><img id="cNXYJFwC83wsh96rQCDvw6" name="tcl-nxtpaper-60-ultra-on-table" alt="A TCL NXTPAPER 60 Ultra lying on a table beside flowers and some scattered papers." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cNXYJFwC83wsh96rQCDvw6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="400" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: TCL)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Other hardware specs include a circular triple camera array on the back of the 60 Ultra. TCL states this will provide consumers with a 50MP main camera, a 50MP telephoto with a 3x zoom, and an 8UW camera, per its official document. On the front, consumers will find a 32MP lens.</p><p>Powering the device is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-7400-7400x-ultra-efficient-gaming-ai-chips">MediaTek's Dimensity 7400</a> SoC, an ultra-efficient chip capable of handling games and AI.</p><p>Artificial intelligence is another aspect that TCL has focused on for its 60 Ultra. More specifically, the company states its AI, such as the TCL Note app and the Max Ink Mode, helps users interested in reading and writing daily. The former is said to offer a paper-like writing experience with AI tools to help users be more productive. The Max Ink Mode offers a "distraction-free" experience for users looking to read without being bothered by notifications.</p><h2 id="the-60-ultra-s-junior-and-a-new-watch-2">The 60 Ultra's Junior and a new Watch</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:900px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="J9UV7nNLcAuHuRWPy85DdK" name="tcl-nxtpaper-60-ultra-stylus" alt="A model using the TCL NXTPAPER 60 Ultra and its stylus outside." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/J9UV7nNLcAuHuRWPy85DdK.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="900" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: TCL)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:850px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:70.59%;"><img id="DLTkQnZFwKMVw39oJoWsCX" name="tcl-nxtpaper-5g-junior" alt="The new NXTPAPER 5G Junior, a device aimed at younger users with eye-safe displays and a Digital Detox feature." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DLTkQnZFwKMVw39oJoWsCX.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="850" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: TCL)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:899px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.74%;"><img id="Nt2eHdRisDrftdEN5Xg5DX" name="tcl-nxtpaper-mt48-kids-smartwatch" alt="A pink TCL MOVETIME MT48 smartwatch on a young model in a library." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Nt2eHdRisDrftdEN5Xg5DX.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="899" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: TCL)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Rounding things out for the 60 Ultra is 12GB of RAM (plus an additional 12GB via RAM expansion) with up to 512GB of storage.

The plan, which costs about $23 per month, has been an easy way to split the subscription with others. However, it now looks like YouTube will soon crack down on users sharing accounts outside their household.</p><p>It seems YouTube has started notifying users who are part of a Family plan but not physically located in the same household as the family manager.

One turns the Fenix 8 Pro into a true standalone smartwatch; the other gives it fantastic visuals, at the expense of battery life.</p><p>Announced on September 3, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/1701921/">Garmin Fenix 8 Pro AMOLED</a> ships in two sizes: 47mm ($1,200) and 51mm ($1,300), making it just $100 more than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Garmin Fenix 8</a>. In exchange, you can subscribe to the InReach service and stay connected with friends and family on long outdoor excursions, whether your phone is dead, at home, or out of LTE range.</p><p>The Fenix 8 Pro MicroLED only comes in one 51mm size ($2,000); while cheaper than the Garmin MARQ series, it's still one of Garmin's most expensive models ever. In exchange, you get the brighest smartwatch display ever, courtesy of 400,000 individual LEDs that prevent the burn-in you get with AMOLED displays.</p><p>Here's everything we've learned about the Garmin Fenix 8 Pro, including how much an LTE/ satellite subscription costs and where it's available, how the Pro compares to the Fenix 8 for battery life, and what the fuss is with MicroLED displays.</p><h2 id="how-lte-and-satellite-works-on-the-garmin-fenix-8-pro-2">How LTE and satellite works on the Garmin Fenix 8 Pro</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8192px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="okKMT5B8g8bfLdHtTzrvBh" name="Garmin-Fenix-8-Pro-press-photo-4" alt="A photo of a woman kayaking while wearing a Garmin Fenix 8 Pro, using it to call someone using LTE cellular data." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/okKMT5B8g8bfLdHtTzrvBh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8192" height="4608" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Garmin Fenix 8 Pro currently gets cellular coverage in 34 countries and territories, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/connectivity/fenix8pro/coverage/">listed here</a>. Essentially, it's available in the U.S. and Canada, most of Europe, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand.</p><p>While an Apple or Android watch with LTE can use your phone number and native messaging, the Fenix 8 Pro must use Garmin's InReach plan, which messages directly through Garmin Messenger.</p><p>Your contacts will need to download Messenger to call you or send voice messages; you can text people without Messenger, but they'll receive that text from a random Garmin number.</p><p>The Fenix 8 Pro uses low-powered LTE-M cellular networks instead of standard LTE. Standard LTE towers typically have LTE-M signals, too, so you should get coverage wherever your phone normally would. Garmin says this LTE-M solution maximizes your watch's battery life, but that these signals are more susceptible to getting blocked by large concrete or steel buildings.</p><p>Previously, the Fenix 8 could send messages through Garmin Messenger, but only with an InReach satellite device as an intermediary. Now, the Fenix 8 Pro can stand alone, letting you stay connected via cellular or satellite.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2088px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:76.63%;"><img id="boyDaQ3KEFjVKZxvAjw84F" name="Garmin-Fenix-8-Pro-satellite-coverage-north-america" alt="A map showing the Garmin InReach satellite and cellular coverage areas for the Garmin Fenix 8 Pro in North America." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/boyDaQ3KEFjVKZxvAjw84F.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2088" height="1600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2094px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:76.41%;"><img id="qRLWyZ6SuFeoAxh4hdALwE" name="Garmin-Fenix-8-Pro-satellite-coverage-europe" alt="A map showing the Garmin InReach satellite and cellular coverage areas for the Garmin Fenix 8 Pro in Europe." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qRLWyZ6SuFeoAxh4hdALwE.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2094" height="1600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>A Fenix 8 Pro InReach account includes both LTE and satellite messaging.

But these new features come with noticeable trade-offs, aside from the higher price.</p><p>The Fenix 8 Pro 47mm measures 16mm thick, or 2.2mm thicker than the Fenix 8 47mm; the 51mm Pro measures 16.5mm (a 1.8mm gap), while the 51mm Pro MicroLED hits a whopping 17.5mm thick.</p><p>The Fenix 8 was already on the thick side for Garmin watches; now, the Pro lineup is significantly bulkier than nearly any fitness watch on the market, and likely won't be especially comfortable for sleep tracking; you'll probably want to get the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-index-sleep-monitor-comfortable-band-insightful-health-data-launch">Garmin Index Sleep Monitor</a>, too.</p><p>Thankfully, the Fenix 8-to-8-Pro weight gap is negligible, so it won't be less comfortable.

The Pixel 10 series is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-esim">eSIM-only</a> in the U.S. However, it turns out there is at least one way to get a Pixel 10 device in the U.S. with a physical SIM card slot.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/09/02/google-pixel-10-replacements-physical-sim-support-rma/">9to5Google</a>, users requesting replacement Pixel 10 devices are receiving the global version, which has the SIM card slot at the top. The publication cited a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1n6tegp/rmaed_a_pixel_10_pro_xl_new_replacement_has/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1">Reddit post</a> where a user requested a replacement Pixel 10 Pro XL due to a "screen issue."</p><p>Apparently, the unit shipped to them was not the U.S. version but a global model complete with a SIM slot.

The original poster said they had reached out to Google about why they had received a physical SIM version, but hadn't yet received a reply.</p><p>As it turns out, however, there is one drawback for U.S. users getting a physical SIM version of the Pixel 10. The U.S. eSIM-only units support <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/explaining-5g-millimeter-wave-sub-6-low-band-and-other-terms-you-need-know">mmWave 5G networks</a>, while global SIM models do not. So if you get that version in the US, you'll miss out on the fastest speeds and must rely on sub-6GHz 5G only.</p><p>That said, it appears there's still no way to directly get a physical SIM Pixel 10 from Google. It looks like the company is only providing replacement units, and we expect even those will soon be swapped out for the eSIM variant in the U.S.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/1943169/614286/10014?subId1=ac-us-5420766087977553015&sharedId=ac-us&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Ftop-deals%2Fcell-phone-deals%2Fpcmcat1563302848653.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat1563302848653" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1690538&xcust=ac_us_4103361842085162595&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1943169%2F565706%2F9383%3FsubId1%3Dac-us-4792126853743754287%26sharedId%3Dac-us%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.walmart.com%252Fcp%252Fcell-phones%252F1105910%253Fpovid%253Dweb_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.androidcentral.com%2Fphones%2Fsamsung-galaxy%2Fsamsung-brings-one-ui-8-beta-to-older-flagships-and-mid-range-phones" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://shop-links.co/link?publisher_slug=future&exclusive=1&u1=ac-us-8840006662694302210&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fshop%2Fall-deals%2Fcell-phone-deals%2F&article_name=One%20UI%208%20is%20nearly%20ready%20for%20the%20Galaxy%20S25%2C%20with%20a%20fifth%20beta%20now%20rolling%20out&article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.androidcentral.com%2Fphones%2Fsamsung-galaxy%2Fone-ui-8-beta-5-for-samsung-galaxy-s25" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dcell%2Bphone%26crid%3D19CKV7OMEPEMF%26sprefix%3Dcell%2Bphone%252Caps%252C222%26ref%3Dnb_sb_noss_1%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1377800089846706275-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100048248-15733793?sid=ac-us-3245051012332737972&url=https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100048248-15735111?sid=ac-us-1233504750112697981&url=https://www.att.com/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

While the Galaxy S25 FE bears a striking resemblance to its predecessor, it does pack a sneaky set of upgrades including a new chip, upgraded front-facing camera, and a bigger battery with faster charging. For small tablet lovers, there's finally a new 11-inch Galaxy Tab S11 to go along with the behemoth <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/samsungs-galaxy-tab-s11-ultra-is-here-and-it-aims-to-replace-your-laptop">Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra</a>.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-launches-galaxy-s25-fe">Samsung Galaxy S25 FE</a> is the first Galaxy S25 phone to run <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/my-8-favorite-things-about-the-one-ui-8-beta">One UI 8</a>, based on Android 16. It's a small detail, and the other four Galaxy S25 devices will get the update eventually, but it goes to show how Samsung is bridging the gap between midrange and flagship territory with the Galaxy S25 FE. Meanwhile, the Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra is even thinner and sports a fresh processor as well.</p><p>I briefly went hands-on with Samsung's new phone and tablets at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/ifa">IFA 2025</a>, and I have to admit, I'm excited. It's good to have a small, current-generation tablet in Samsung's lineup again, and it's great to see the Galaxy S25 FE fleshed out as a flagship-killer. Here's everything you need to know about them.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-specs"><span>Specs</span></h2><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol empty" ></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy S25 FE</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy Tab S11</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.7-inch<br>2340 x 1080 FHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2X   </p></td><td  ><p>11-inch<br>2560 √ó 1600 Dynamic AMOLED 2X, 120 Hz     </p></td><td  ><p>14.6-inch<br>2960 √ó 1848 Dynamic AMOLED 2X, 120 Hz     </p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Deca-core Exynos 2400 (4 nm)   </p></td><td  ><p>MediaTek Dimensity 9400 Plus     </p></td><td  ><p>MediaTek Dimensity 9400 Plus </p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Memory</p></td><td  ><p>8GB</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td><td  ><p>12GB (16GB with 1TB storage)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>128GB, 256GB, 512GB</p></td><td  ><p>128GB, 256GB, 512GB</p></td><td  ><p>256GB, 512GB, 1TB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Operating system</p></td><td  ><p>One UI 8</p></td><td  ><p>One UI 8</p></td><td  ><p>One UI 8</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Front camera</p></td><td  ><p>12 MP f/2.2   </p></td><td  ><p>12 MP (Ultra Wide 120¬∞)     </p></td><td  ><p>12 MP (Ultra Wide 120¬∞) </p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear cameras</p></td><td  ><p>12 MP f/2.2 (Ultra Wide) 50 MP f/1.8 (Wide)<br>8 MP 3x f/2.4 (Telephoto)   </p></td><td  ><p>13 MP     </p></td><td  ><p>13 MP<br>8 MP (Ultra Wide)     </p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>4,900mAh   </p></td><td  ><p>8,400mAh</p></td><td  ><p>11,600mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging</p></td><td  ><p>45W Super Fast Charging Fast Wireless Charging 2.0 Wireless PowerShare</p></td><td  ><p>45W Super Fast Charging</p></td><td  ><p>45W Super Fast Charging</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>161.3 x 76.6 x 7.4 mm   </p></td><td  ><p>165.3 x 253.8 x 5.5 mm     </p></td><td  ><p>208.5 x 326.3 x 5.1 mm     </p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>190g</p></td><td  ><p>469g     </p></td><td  ><p>690g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>IP rating</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Jetblack, Navy, Icyblue, White</p></td><td  ><p>Grey, Silver     </p></td><td  ><p>Grey, Silver</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-s25-fe"><span>Samsung Galaxy S25 FE</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="y2Uyt2etCfqQJoktXPs4EF" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-FE-2" alt="The Samsung Galaxy S25 FE in hands-on photos." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y2Uyt2etCfqQJoktXPs4EF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When I first held the Samsung Galaxy S25 FE, it felt quite similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-hands-on">Galaxy S24 FE</a>, but the differences became quickly apparent. The glossy back of the Galaxy S24 FE, which ended up being a fingerprint magnet, is now gone in favor of a smooth matte finish. It's available in Jetblack, Navy, Icyblue, and White, and I think the darker colors pair nicely with the silver aluminum side rails to create an excellent contrasting look.</p><p>The rear side of the phone has a basic triple-camera array, much like the three main Galaxy S25 models, albeit without the DSLR-style lens covers. It also doesn't have the oval-shaped camera bump riser we see on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review">Galaxy S25 Edge</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>. As such, the Galaxy S25 FE has managed to carve out a unique look despite existing in a crowded lineup of Samsung phones.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TJvjF5dKCdJsuoRPBrZzUF" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-FE-5" alt="The Samsung Galaxy S25 FE in hands-on photos." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TJvjF5dKCdJsuoRPBrZzUF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Thin feels like the name of the game for Samsung in 2025. The Galaxy S25 FE isn't breaking any records, but its thinner 7.4mm profile is certainly a welcomed addition compared to the 8mm thickness of its predecessor. On the design front, it's also 23 grams lighter than the previous model, weighing in at only 190 grams. Anytime you can get a 6.7-inch smartphone under 200 grams, it's worth taking note of ‚Äî this is a difference you'll feel in both your hand and pocket.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BHuZTijDCu3hRigV5AUKZF" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-FE-6" alt="The Samsung Galaxy S25 FE in hands-on photos." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BHuZTijDCu3hRigV5AUKZF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, there's not much new about the display. The panel itself isn't bad at all; it's a 6.7-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2x screen with support for 120Hz refresh rates. However, the bezels on the Galaxy S25 FE still aren't uniform, leaving you with a larger "chin" below the bottom of the display. It's an unfortunate characteristic that may be distracting to some and makes the phone feel cheaper than it is.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5MFLoWPjddb7oCNtfNvymM" name="S25-FE-Bezels" alt="The bezels on the Samsung Galaxy S25 FE that aren't uniform." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5MFLoWPjddb7oCNtfNvymM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Galaxy S25 FE is now powered by the Samsung Exynos 2400 chip, a slight bump from the lower-spec Exynos 2400e found within the Galaxy S24 FE. You get the same 8GB of memory and 128GB of base storage, though it can be upgraded to 512GB for the first time.</p><p>There are clear performance limitations here, at least going off the spec sheet, but Samsung managed to cram even more AI features in the Galaxy S25 FE. It gets many of the best One UI 7 and One UI 8 tools, like the ProVisual Engine for the camera system and the Now Bar and Brief. Speaking of the cameras, the front-facing sensor is upgraded to 12MP on this year's model.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5rdejtR6KaGiswQ6FaeZZF" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-FE-3" alt="The Samsung Galaxy S25 FE in hands-on photos." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5rdejtR6KaGiswQ6FaeZZF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Battery capacity is upped to 4,900mAh and there's now support for 45W wired fast charging, which should help deliver all-day battery life.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-tab-s11"><span>Samsung Galaxy Tab S11</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="aqrPxCEh3Xb58tN5A29XWo" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-S11-8" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 with the Book Cover Keyboard attached." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aqrPxCEh3Xb58tN5A29XWo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you recall, there was never a Samsung Galaxy Tab S10, so the Galaxy Tab S11 marks the first 11-inch flagship tablet from Samsung in over two years. In the time since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9">Galaxy Tab S9</a> released, a lot has changed and a bunch has stayed the same, too. The overall look and feel of the Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 is still here, but it's thinner at 5.5mm compared to 5.9mm.</p><p>Samsung kept the same display for the Galaxy Tab S11, an 11-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2x panel with 120Hz support. There is a new stylus to pair with it, as Samsung redesigned the S Pen to be more ergonomic and add tilt-based writing and drawing features. The S Pen is now hexagon-shaped, with six flat sides that end in a cone-shaped tip for drawing.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xPoccTwjDz7bMSngXxoPxA" name="New-S-Pen" alt="The new S Pen for tablets (left) compared to a regular pencil (right)." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xPoccTwjDz7bMSngXxoPxA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The new S Pen for tablets (left) compared to a regular pencil (right).  </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This feels like using a standard pencil, and I find it more comfortable and natural to use than the old S Pen and the Apple Pencil ‚Äî both only have one flat side.

There is a 16GB memory option, but it only comes with the 1TB storage configuration, so it'll be an expensive upgrade. There's no doubt that the Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra is powerful, and Samsung is trying to capitalize on that power in software this year.</p><p>You get a new version on Samsung DeX on both tablets called Extended Mode, which lets you take advantage of both your Galaxy Tab S11 screen and an external monitor. You can use this for multitasking, dragging and dropping content between screens, or present separate content on each display. Another new way to use Samsung DeX is with workspaces ‚Äî you can create up to four separate desktop environments for different tasks in DeX mode.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CbbTUYWHZABsAXJqhxp5mW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-S11-2" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 and S11 Ultra." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CbbTUYWHZABsAXJqhxp5mW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Of course, these enhanced DeX features will be most useful on the Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra, which packs a 14.6-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2x screen. It's designed to be paired with the Book Cover Keyboard Slim for those who want to turn the tablet into a laptop alternative. Personally, I find the sheer size of the Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra to be daunting ‚Äî it's too big for what I prefer to use tablets for. However, you might enjoy having that extra screen real estate for productivity and content consumption.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="aAHo8NoVaxPv2aexFa3biW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-S11-1" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 and S11 Ultra." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aAHo8NoVaxPv2aexFa3biW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The side profile of the Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Finally, it's worth calling out that the Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra is now just 5.1mm thick, which is a crazy number. With that being said, I didn't get the same "wow" factor from holding the Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra as I got from using the Galaxy S25 Edge. The thickness simply doesn't seem as big of a deal on a tablet compared to a phone, but it <em>does</em> matter if you like to use a case or keyboard cover attached.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-availability"><span>Availability</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nerFJgEwc5cZz5tYCUgutW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-FE-All-Colors" alt="All four colors of the Samsung Galaxy S25 FE." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nerFJgEwc5cZz5tYCUgutW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 FE is available starting now, Sept. 4, in four colors: Jetblack, Navy, Icyblue, and White.

The publication claims the device will offer three major features: wireless charging, reverse wireless charging, and NFC capabilities for "practicality" reasons. While these are elements to a handheld device that we typically expect from flagships nowadays, the post says Samsung is also focusing on the trifold's longevity.</p><p>Foldables, whether they're like the clamshell Flip 7, the book-style Fold 7, or these larger three-screen "trifolds," the publication says Samsung is supposedly looking to address durability concerns. To do this, the post claims the device is taking an "inward-folding" approach, which will enable Samsung's design to protect its "main display when folded."</p><p>This also takes us back to another alleged feature: the trifold's G-folding method. The post suspects that this mechanism will aid the device in keeping dust and other debris away from this sensitive folding display when folded shut. Additionally, there are rumors that Samsung has taken some of its work with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-finally-pulls-ahead-of-the-flip-in-sales-in-korea">Flip 7 and Fold 7's</a> hinge to increase the longevity of the trifold's folding lifespan.</p><h2 id="the-long-awaited-trifold-2">The long-awaited trifold</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="4txujVEQvBDeorsM3bCXXE" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-flip-7-mint-hands-on-4" alt="Samsung Galaxy Fold 7 and Flip 7 in Mint hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4txujVEQvBDeorsM3bCXXE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1407" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are some important notes to make here from these rumors, especially about the trifold's potential inspiration for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-says-galaxy-z-fold-7-screen-decade-long-durability-report">increased hinge/folding longevity</a>. Shortly after the latest Galaxy foldables launched, Samsung discussed its Fold 7 and how its upgraded screen and other mechanics could help it withstand up to a decade's worth of folds. The company stated its latest screen tests show that it can survive up to 500,000 folds, which would take the "average user" up to 10 years to reach.</p><p>The phone's UTG (ultra thin glass) also got an upgrade, which should help reduce the appearance of a crease even more.</p><p>On a related note, there were some rumors just recently that seemingly came <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-trifold-leak-one-ui-animations-qi2-nfc-into-focus">straight from Samsung's One UI software</a>. The leaked animations seemed to suggest NFC, wireless, and reverse wireless charging. What surfaced showed that the majority of this will be done via the right-most side of the phone, where its vertical triple camera array resides.</p><p>Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-galaxy-z-trifold-and-android-xr-headset-are-finally-landing-this-year">has confirmed</a> that its trifold is looking at a second half of 2025 launch. It's still up in the air when that could take place. Presently, we're awaiting its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/virtual-unpacked-for-samsung-next-galaxy-devices-september-date">Virtual Galaxy event</a> on September 4.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Wired headphones that connect with a traditional 3.5mm audio jack will need a USB-C to 3.5mm adapter in order to work, though.</p></article></section><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-does-music-sound-through-wired-usb-c-headphones-on-the-s25"><span>How does music sound through wired USB-C headphones on the S25?</span></h2><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Galaxy S25 gaming audio</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/how-does-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-handle-audio-during-gaming"><strong>How does the Samsung Galaxy S25 handle audio during gaming?</strong></a></p></div></div><p>Anyone extra persnickety about sound quality knows that wired audio is always superior because the signal doesn't have to be compressed to go through a cable, the way it has when using wireless Bluetooth speakers or headphones. Even using high-tech codecs like LDAC doesn't deliver <em>true</em> hi-res audio because there's always a level of compression between your phone and Bluetooth earbuds.</p><p>Audiophiles worried about downgrading their audio quality by switching to a Galaxy S25 have nothing to fear. Samsung's engineers have ensured that you get excellent quality audio from the Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25 Plus, and Galaxy S25 Ultra, regardless of how you're listening to music.</p><p>While the Galaxy S25 family doesn't have a traditional 3.5mm headphone jack, you can always pick up an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Headphone-Adapter-JSAUX-Compatible-Samsung/dp/B07XYQ2ZKH/">inexpensive USB-C to 3.5mm adapter</a> to connect wired headphones to a Galaxy S25. Thankfully, there's nothing to configure or pair when you use a pair of wired headphones. Just plug them in and enjoy the tunes!</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">best music streaming service</a>, Tidal Hi-Fi, works perfectly on the Galaxy S25 Ultra and is even better when paired with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-headphones">best USB-C headphones</a>. This ensures that you don't have to worry about remembering your adapter, and also never have to worry about charging a pair of headphones or earbuds just to use them.

Samsung prefers LDAC over aptX HD, so be sure to look for LDAC when you choose a pair of Bluetooth earbuds or headphones to get the highest possible wireless sound quality. The Galaxy S25 family supports SBC, AAC, LDAC, and Samsung Seamless Codec for Bluetooth playback.</p><p>While LDAC and aptX HD are the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-to-stream-hi-res-music-from-phone">best way to stream hi-res audio</a>, there's no such thing as true lossless audio over Bluetooth. A Bluetooth signal <em>always</em> has to be compressed to some degree, and while most people probably can't tell the difference between a good pair of wired headphones and high-quality hi-res Bluetooth earbuds, audiophiles won't be fooled.</p><p>That being said, only Sony phones deliver higher-quality audio playback, as our sister site <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.whathifi.com/smartphones-tablets/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra">What Hi-Fi pointed out</a> in their Galaxy S25 Ultra review. Our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/these-9-earbuds-support-high-res-codecs">best hi-res Bluetooth earbuds</a> guide will help you narrow down your choices, but here are a few quick picks from the top to get you started:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C345M3T7"><strong>Sony WF-1000XM5</strong></a>: The best hi-res Bluetooth earbuds on the market. They (unsurprisingly) support Sony's LDAC codec, which is perfect for the Galaxy S25 family.</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DCQ4GLL2"><strong>Bowers & Wilkins Pi8</strong></a>: We recommend these for non-Samsung Android phones, as they primarily support the aptX HD codec for hi-res audio transfer.</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Edifier-NeoBuds-Plus-Cancelling-Bluetooth/dp/B0DHRMD3JT/"><strong>Edifier NeoBuds Plus</strong></a>: A more budget-conscious choice that still supports LDAC and hi-res sound.</li></ul><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-does-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-s-sound-quality-really-compete-with-apple-or-sony"><span>Does the Samsung Galaxy S25's sound quality really compete with Apple or Sony?</span></h2><p>Sony has long been considered the de facto standard for Android phone audio quality, but Samsung is no slouch in the audio department. While Apple notably enhanced its audio quality with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16</a> release, the Galaxy S25 family isn't too far behind, offering crisp and detailed audio quality, specializing particularly in delivering clear vocals.</p><p>Audio reviews of the Galaxy S25 family have often noted that low-level dynamics aren't quite as good as Apple's or Sony's latest phones, but that the S25 family is still in the overall top tier when it comes to sound reproduction. That's particularly true when using the built-in speaker on the S25 family, as Samsung's use of Dolby Atmos tuning transforms the phone's speakers into a virtual wall of sound.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 family supports everything you need to get a high-quality audio experience on the go. Wired headphones using a USB-C cable are the best option for the highest possible quality sound, while Bluetooth earbuds that support hi-res LDAC audio are the second-best option. We recommend browsing our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/what-are-the-best-headphones-to-pair-with-the-galaxy-s25-for-premium-sound">best Galaxy S25 premium headphones</a> guide so you can get a full understanding of what's available and what makes them the best for Samsung's 2025 flagships.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-is-the-audio-quality-consistent-across-different-apps-on-the-s25"><span>Is the audio quality consistent across different apps on the S25?</span></h2><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 family's audio quality is managed on a system level to ensure consistent audio quality between apps. Samsung offers a built-in audio equalizer with support for several Dolby Atmos profiles, sound presets, adaptive age filters, and even a UHQ upscaler for supported wired headphones.</p><p>While some apps may have individual equalizers that can be used in addition to the system equalizer, it's recommended to use Samsung's built-in option for the most consistent audio quality.</p><p>Each type of audio source can have its own settings, too, and the Galaxy S25 will intelligently remember which settings you prefer for each audio source. For example, if I connect my Bluetooth <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro</a> to my Galaxy S25 Ultra, it will have individual settings I've tailored for it, while a pair of wired headphones will have a different set of settings saved and automatically applied.</p><p>Apps can individually have their own sound profiles, too. Here's how to configure that:</p><p>1. Launch your audio app of choice and <strong>start playing a song or video</strong>.</p><p>2. Pull down on the right side of the status bar and <strong>long-press the volume slider</strong>.</p><p>3. A <strong>Sound and effects</strong> box will appear with audio options for the specific app that's playing audio.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3030px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.73%;"><img id="RqGYRQGPb4w72XCqtcarKg" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-app-audio" alt="Adjusting app audio settings on the Galaxy S25" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RqGYRQGPb4w72XCqtcarKg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3030" height="3052" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This way, each app can have its own distinct audio settings. This is particularly useful for adjusting audio mixes between video, music, and other sound sources. To reconfigure an app's audio properties, follow the steps above or go to the main audio section by following these steps:</p><p>1. Open system settings by navigating to the <strong>Settings</strong> option in the app drawer, or pulling down on the right side of the status bar and tapping the settings gear icon on the top right.</p><p>2. Select <strong>Sounds and vibration</strong> from the list.</p><p>3. Select <strong>Sound quality and effects</strong> from the list.</p><p>4. Select <strong>App sound settings</strong> from the list.</p><p>5. Select the app you want to adjust audio properties for.

Individual hearing profiles can be made to adjust for hearing loss for different age ranges, as well as sound tuning via a 9-slider equalizer with various presets. Each audio source also includes its own customizable preset that is automatically saved.</p><p>To access the system-level equalizer and sound profiles, follow these steps:</p><p>1. Open system settings by navigating to the <strong>Settings</strong> option in the app drawer, or pulling down on the right side of the status bar and tapping the settings gear icon on the top right.</p><p>2. Select <strong>Sounds and vibration</strong> from the list.</p><p>3. Select <strong>Sound quality and effects</strong> from the list.</p><p>4.

Once you've done that, open the equalizer section and tune the sound further. Equalizer allows you to very specifically tune the audio profile, while the presets and the Dolby Atmos section are more automated.</p><p>Additionally, you might want to select <strong>Boost dialogue</strong> when listening to a podcast or other audio source where human speech is the most important thing to hear. You can also choose <strong>Loudness normalization</strong> to help keep explosions and other loud sound effects from hurting your ears while watching movies or videos.</p><p>Folks looking for age-specific audio profiles should choose <strong>Adapt sound</strong>, then select your specific age bracket from the list. Clicking the gear icon next to each age bracket allows you to also choose which ear will primarily use audio for phone calls, and if you prefer a clear or soft sound profile.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This just makes it more intimate for two people to basically watch anything together, whether you're at a cafe or on a plane; watching your favorite show becomes seamless.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="tp8W5DJ8UJHVqVtgYh6rsV" name="Audiorsharing-Auracast-LE-audio" alt="Android Sept update brings Auracast and LE audio sharing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tp8W5DJ8UJHVqVtgYh6rsV.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="800" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>And this feature isn't limited to just two people; if you're with a group and want to share a catchy soundtrack you've just been hooked onto,  you can also share the audio with multiple people, thanks to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/i-tried-bluetooth-auracast-at-ifa-2024">Auracast</a>.</p><p>All you have to do is connect their headphones to your phone by scanning a QR code or with a single tap using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.android.com/better-together/">Google‚Äôs Fast Pair</a> ‚Äî  without needing to hand over your earbud.

The company states the Android redesign should help users make their devices feel more "personal." Users can now customize their calling experience with contacts with a background that represents them.</p><p>The Quick Settings menu receives a touch-up, taking on a more "sleek" appearance. What's more, Google states Pixel 6 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Pixel Tablet</a> users will have access to Live effects (animations) on their lock screen.</p><h2 id="updates-for-buds-watches-2">Updates for Buds & Watches</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:290px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:206.90%;"><img id="Q4sAGakoT7LHABwYesAJEN" name="google-pixel-material-3-call-contact-screen" alt="With the new Material 3 Expressive update, Pixel 6 users can customize their call screens for contacts with unique images." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Q4sAGakoT7LHABwYesAJEN.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="290" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:290px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:206.90%;"><img id="jwhmcVGSSDgvN8RtyAz9EN" name="google-pixel-material-3-lock-screen-live-effects" alt="Google is rolling out its Material 3 Expressive redesign on the Pixel 6, bringing Live effects for customized lock screens to users." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jwhmcVGSSDgvN8RtyAz9EN.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="290" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Google's Pixel Buds Pro 2 will soon grab an update that brings an uninterrupted Gemini experience to your ears. The post states users can still converse with the AI model even when noise is abundant around you, like if you're watching TV or there are other people around. Additionally, answering calls just got a little easier: just nod your head (or shake it!) to answer or decline.</p><p>The company's buds are also in line to pick up Adaptive Audio. Essentially, your buds will automatically adjust your volume levels depending on your surroundings to ensure you can hear your audio content, but also the world around you. This update adds "Loud Noise Protection" to help protect users' hearing.</p><p>Joining these updates is one more for smartwatches. Google states users can begin a "walking or biking" navigation on their phone via Maps and watch it appear on their smartwatch. The post touts this as "automatic, hands-free guidance" that users don't have to think about. Once things have begun on your phone, just check your watch to make sure you're on the right path.</p><p>Google states these updates are rolling out today (Sep 3); however, it may take some time before everyone sees them. The rollout is expected to last a "couple of weeks," so just keep tabs on your devices for the new goodies.</p><p>Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/first-things-to-do-with-the-google-pixel-10">Pixel 10 series</a> launched with this new Material 3 Expressive redesign. However, the company clued us into this massive Android revamp <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-unveils-the-most-massive-android-redesign-ever">during its I/O conference</a> earlier in May. While it is the biggest redesign the OS has had, its purpose is not only to make things pretty but to make everything easier to do. Google combined colors, shapes, effects, and more to bring about a more "expressive" design to Android users.</p><p>The company also explained that it focused on making buttons and elements large enough to tap and see, so people can do what's required and keep moving.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="067be8d6-bc32-44cf-992a-3c6a77e7e366">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/roHfB8CwZvHJScuZ8TL6Bf.jpg' alt="Google Pixel 10"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 10</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>If you're looking for Pixel magic, here it is. Google's new Pixel 10 is the entry-level model for its brand-new series.

Additionally, the Pixel 10 sports worthy upgrades, like better Gemini AI, upgraded battery and charging, and a new flashy Indigo color.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

My wife and I love the outdoors, swimming pools, and beaches. We literally live between mountains, deserts, and the California coastline, so we love a quick VRBO weekend getaway, and music plays a part in that, no matter where we might find ourselves. Often, those getaways also include our friend group, so having a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-speakers">portable speaker</a> that sounds good and can withstand the demands of wherever we might find ourselves is essential.</p><p>I have a feeling that the Bose SoundLink Plus will play an important part in those excursions going forward. It sounds great and can stand up to the beach, the boat, a small gathering, and more. Let‚Äôs get into that, along with my recounting of the day I almost drowned, but the SoundLink Plus didn‚Äôt.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Categories</p></th><th  ><p>Bose SoundLink Plus</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Bluetooth 5.4, Multipoint support</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Driver/Acoustic Architecture</p></td><td  ><p>One subwoofer, one tweeter, four passive radiators</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Codec support</p></td><td  ><p>SBC, AAC, aptX Adaptive (Snapdragon Sound)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery life</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 20 hours, 4 hours at max volume (replaceable battery)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging</p></td><td  ><p>USB-C, 5 hours to full, charge-out at 15W</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Durability</p></td><td  ><p>IP67</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>App support</p></td><td  ><p>Android, iOS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Black, Blue Dusk, Citrus Yellow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h2 id="drowning-in-sound-in-a-manner-of-speaking-2">Drowning in sound.

It wasn‚Äôt one of the highly trafficked, well-known beaches like those found in Venice, Santa Monica, or Malibu. We went to a section of the beach, a bit off the beaten path, a spot we‚Äôd been to before.</p><p>Long story short, the tide came in much higher and earlier than expected, and we had some dicey moments getting back up the beach. So much so that we lost most things in our wagon, trying to get it across that wet section, including the Bose SoundLink Plus I had just started reviewing.</p><p>Much to my surprise, about 10 feet further down the beach, on some rocks, there was the SoundLink Plus. It had washed out, and the tide brought it right back in. It passed the float test, and we didn‚Äôt die.</p><p>With the accidental durability test out of the way, I turned my attention to testing the sound quality. Let‚Äôs backtrack a little, first.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LPA8LQwTPkYqiyF6mNDNd7" name="bose-soundlink-plus-carrying-loop" alt="Bose SoundLink Plus being held by the rugged nylon carry loop" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LPA8LQwTPkYqiyF6mNDNd7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The last speaker I tested was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/beats-pill-2024-review" target="_blank">Beats Pill</a>. It‚Äôs very light, quite small, and a pretty solid device with great sound for its size. You notice the difference immediately when you pick up the Bose SoundLink Plus. It feels much heavier in hand and is visibly larger than the Pill, about the size of a Pill and a half.</p><p>It features a soft-touch body, playback and function controls on top, a powder-coated speaker grille on the front, and an open USB-C port on the rear, along with more porting. I used that port on three different devices to test out the charge-out feature and had no issues charging any of them.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="LKGD3aMotdUmxb9HEu7ZJ9" name="bose-soundlink-plus-controls.JPG" alt="Bose SoundLink Plus top panel controls" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LKGD3aMotdUmxb9HEu7ZJ9.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="LLqvK3P6hFVmjoSJ7hcAT9" name="bose-soundlink-plus-nylon-loop-usb-c.JPG" alt="Bose SoundLink Plus nylon carry loop" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LLqvK3P6hFVmjoSJ7hcAT9.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="hneVVRvfvPjCg9aVAbiCdA" name="bose-soundlink-plus-on-the-fence.JPG" alt="Bose SoundLink Plus hanging from a fence from the rugged nylon carry loop and a carabiner" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hneVVRvfvPjCg9aVAbiCdA.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="soVfpwpzXDBuzSF44TqZAA" name="bose-soundlink-plus-fence-cu.JPG" alt="Bose SoundLink Plus hanging from a fence from the rugged nylon carry loop and a carabiner" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/soVfpwpzXDBuzSF44TqZAA.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="WSb9gs8JLofB3zLtgVwVx9" name="bose-soundlink-plus-bluetooth.JPG" alt="Bose SoundLink Plus Bluetooth connecting" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WSb9gs8JLofB3zLtgVwVx9.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The controls are responsive and easy to access, with the one in the middle serving as a customizable shortcut button that can be assigned to support Bose Speaker Link or to launch Spotify features.</p><p>This may sound silly, but the premium finish of the SoundLink Plus is a delight, down to small details like the thick, color-matched nylon carry rope attached to the side that feels like it will stand up to years of abuse.

I took the SoundLink Plus to my local park for testing. It‚Äôs a large park with large, open spaces alongside playgrounds, a skate park, baseball diamonds, and soccer fields.</p><p>I tested the sound quality at distances of 10, 25, and 50 feet. As physics dictates, the further away from the speaker you get, the more nuance you‚Äôll lose. That said, for a speaker this size, the volume is surprisingly loud at 50 feet. Even better at 25 feet, and ideal at 10 to 15 feet.</p><p>Using Sennheiser‚Äôs new BTD700 dongle, which supports aptX Snapdragon Sound, I was able to maintain a stable connection 50 feet away from the Soundlink Plus. This was line of sight with no obstructions between me and the phone. I‚Äôll explain why I was using the dongle shortly.</p><p>The sound was weighty at 10 and 25 feet. It was warm, robust, and had a very satisfying bass response. The genres best played through the speaker will be those with upper mid and treble-forward sonics, such as Jazz, Folk, Rock, R&B, and Classical. Instrumentation and vocals are clear and crisp, but keep in mind this is a mono speaker, so instrument separation is affected. The speaker sounds so good that I‚Äôd love to hear two in the supported stereo configuration.</p><p>Hip hop, Dubstep, and the more bottom-heavy genres fare well, but the bass will lose punch further from the speaker than 20 feet ‚Äî something you‚Äôll experience with all but the largest of wireless speakers intended for outdoor use, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/soundboks-4-bluetooth-speaker-hands-on">the 36lb SOUNDBOKS 4</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5712px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QzxC4L88yAGSDkzGYmAzC9" name="bose-soundlink-plus-speakers-grille" alt="Bose SoundLink Plus pulling double duty as a "bookshelf speaker"" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QzxC4L88yAGSDkzGYmAzC9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5712" height="3213" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Indoors, the SoundLink Plus is a delight!

Tensor G5 features more custom components than ever, improving performance and optimization, all while using TSMC's industry-leading 3nm process node.</p><p>Tensor G5 doubles down on what Google silicon does best, refining performance for everyday tasks, improving stability and battery life, and adding power for on-device AI processing. In a way, it also doubles down on what Google silicon isn't ‚Äî Tensor G5 is not a benchmark-killer and will always lag behind Qualcomm and Apple designs.

The first four generations of Tensor chips were made by Samsung Foundry, which has struggled to keep up with TSMC's advanced fabrication processes. Specifically, the Tensor G5 chip is manufactured using TSMC's 3nm process node ‚Äî the same one that serves as the foundation for Qualcomm's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> and Apple's A18 Pro.</p><p>Google explains that this new manufacturing technology helps it "pack more transistors into the chip so it‚Äôs more powerful and efficient." The company claims the Tensor G5's CPU is 34% faster on average than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a>. It's even better for AI tasks, as the Tensor G5 tensor processing unit (TPU) is up to 60% more powerful.

Now, Pixel users are looking to the Tensor G5 to bring performance that's finally on par with Apple and Qualcomm chipsets. Does the Pixel 10, powered by Tensor G5, live up to the hype? The answer is mixed, because while the Tensor G5 platform makes the Pixel 10 better for daily use than ever, it still lags behind in synthetic benchmark tests.</p><p>In CPU-heavy benchmarks like Geekbench 6, we see both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-review">Pixel 10</a> and Pixel 10 Pro models produce slightly higher results than the Pixel 9 series. The Pixel 10 Pro puts up better numbers than the base Pixel 10, even though both are powered by Tensor G5. This is likely because the Pixel 10 lacks the vapor chamber used to cool the Pixel 10 Pro and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review">Pixel 10 Pro XL</a>, resulting in better performance and stability on the more expensive models.</p><p>While the Tensor G5 chip beats both the Tensor G4 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-official-exynos-2500-soc-unpacked-devices-reveal">Samsung Exynos 2500</a> processors in single-core tests, the Exynos 2500 actually pulls ahead in multi-core performance. The Tensor G5 platform falls short of even coming close to either the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-vs-regular-snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a> processors.</p><div ><table><caption>Tensor G5 bechmark comparisons</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Test</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel 10 (Tensor G5)</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel 10 Pro/XL (Tensor G5)</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel 9 Pro XL (Tensor G4)</p></th><th  ><p>Honor Magic 7 Pro (Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite)</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra (Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy)</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 (Samsung Exynos 2500)</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Geekbench 6 (single-core)</strong></p></td><td  ><p>2,179</p></td><td  ><p>2,333</p></td><td  ><p>1,895</p></td><td  ><p>2,965</p></td><td  ><p>3,001</p></td><td  ><p>1,849</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Geekbench 6 (multi-core)</strong></p></td><td  ><p>4,777</p></td><td  ><p>6,375</p></td><td  ><p>4,111</p></td><td  ><p>6,342</p></td><td  ><p>9,381</p></td><td  ><p>6,822</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Geekbench AI (quantized score)</strong></p></td><td  ><p>2,742</p></td><td  ><p>3,703</p></td><td  ><p>3,049</p></td><td  ><p>2,115</p></td><td  ><p>4,026</p></td><td  ><p>3,581</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>3DMark Wild Life Extreme (score)</strong></p></td><td  ><p>3,122</p></td><td  ><p>3,254</p></td><td  ><p>2,483</p></td><td  ><p>6,391</p></td><td  ><p>4,855</p></td><td  ><p>4,400</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>3DMark Wild Life Extreme (FPS)</strong></p></td><td  ><p>18.70</p></td><td  ><p>19.49</p></td><td  ><p>14.86</p></td><td  ><p>38.27</p></td><td  ><p>29.08</p></td><td  ><p>26.35</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Even the Tensor G5's TPU doesn't make a splash in benchmark test, with memory being the determining factor in AI performance.

The Pixel 10 Pro fares better with 16GB RAM, beating Samsung's chip but still falling short of Qualcomm.</p><p>Notably, the Tensor G5 appears to be very underpowered for gaming, according to benchmark results. Neither the Pixel 10 nor the Pixel 10 Pro could break the 20FPS barrier in 3DMark's Wild Life Extreme test, whereas the winner (Snapdragon 8 Elite) posted a result of 38.27FPS.

On the contrary, Chipolo went the unconventional route, sticking with basic Qi wireless charging on the new Chipolo CARD. Yet, Chipolo somehow managed to incorporate magnets in the design as well. I was curious about this decision, especially since Qi2 is the latest industry standard and combines the two functions ‚Äî wireless charging and magnetism ‚Äî into one.</p><p>While it may seem like an awful lot of work, Chipolo had a very good reason to forgo Qi2 in favor of the older Qi standard, and Baroviƒç was very straightforward with the explanation. "The honest answer here is that Qi2 involves larger coils. I can say it with quite confidence that it's impossible to make it in such a thin form factor. So what we did is, we combined the best of both worlds."</p><p>He went on to explain that Chipolo was happy with the basic Qi wireless charging speed since users only need to recharge their CARD trackers once every six months. To top it off, the CARD has a tiny 200mAh-ish battery that doesn't take long to recharge wirelessly anyway. Thus, it made more sense for the designers to adapt magnets into the old Qi spec rather than work with a bulkier Qi2 coil that would ruin the lightness and slimness of the product. At the end of the day, it was the auto-alignment ability that mattered.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="zuavES3typ4fWVrb8Uw9Mn" name="Chipolo-Domen-Barovic-CDO-cofounder-2025-lifestyle" alt="Chipolo's Chief Design Officer and Co-founder, Domen Baroviƒç, featured speaking on stage at a launch event in mid-2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zuavES3typ4fWVrb8Uw9Mn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4500" height="2531" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Chipolo)</span></figcaption></figure><p>"We're very proud that our product aligns in the center [of the wireless charger].

In fact, it's been dabbling in bypasses and hacks since the very beginning. "When we first introduced our Bluetooth trackers, that was 11 years ago. Bluetooth actually was not built for this purpose. We constantly had to hack something," reminisced Baroviƒç.</p><h2 id="the-future-of-bluetooth-trackers-2">The future of Bluetooth trackers</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:907px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="VEB8hxhpyUkEg9u4u8cZYL" name="Chipolo-LOOP-and-CARD-2025" alt="Chipolo LOOP 2025 and Chipolo CARD 2025 Bluetooth trackers" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VEB8hxhpyUkEg9u4u8cZYL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="907" height="510" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Chipolo)</span></figcaption></figure><p>After drifting into the past, our conversation eventually ventured into the future of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-trackers">Bluetooth trackers</a>. I inquired about the possibility of Chipolo adapting UWB (Ultra-Wideband) into its future products. Baroviƒç stated that the technology would have to catch up first.</p><p>"In the user testing that we did, we found out that it doesn't make that much sense. That's one point. And the second is that we've introduced Bluetooth Low Energy 6 chips. We're the first to have BLE 6 in our trackers. BLE 6 enables Channel Sounding, so it's similar to UWB, but it uses the Bluetooth protocol. The distance part is covered, but as for the directions, currently, it's not there ‚Äî but we're taking steps. UWB is great to have. We're just waiting for the technology to catch up."</p><p>For now, users seeking quieter findability methods will have to rely on the LED status light in the Chipolo trackers.</p><p>Beyond new features like UWB, other potential developments to look forward to include Chipolo integrations. Baroviƒç also delved into the possibility of different form factors and the adoption of Qi2, but only if the need arises among users.</p><p>Above all else, Chipolo is leaning heavily on integrations with other companies. Although Baroviƒç was not able to explicitly share what collaborations are coming up, he did highlight that this is a key focal point for Chipolo. The brand aims to add findability to everyday items such as toolboxes and motorbikes created by other companies, rather than creating its own findable products from scratch. Many such Chipolo integrations already exist, and they will only increase in the days to come.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Finnish fitness brand Polar, best known for its H10 chest strap and high-end running watches, is throwing its hat in the ring with the Polar Loop band.</p><p>Measuring just 9mm thick and weighing 29g, the Polar Loop uses a soft textile band designed for more seamless sleep tracking than your typical smartwatch that weighs 2-3X more and is thick enough to get caught on your pillow.</p><p>The Polar Loop relies on automatic workout detection via the built-in accelerometer and Precision Prime HR sensor to determine when you're working out and gauge your daily training load and burned calories. But you can also start a workout in the Flow app for more specificity, especially to activate the connected GPS from your phone.</p><p>Polar has confirmed that the Loop will be subscription-free and that "every feature is ready on day one." You'll spend $199 / ‚Ç¨179 / ¬£149 upfront, whereas the popular Whoop 5.0 screenless band costs a minimum of $199 per year to access your data.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:7774px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="UGosNsqRzmYD5MwP9PsuBC" name="polar-loop-press-photo-1" alt="Press photo of two Polar Loop screenless wristbands (one beige, one black) on two different athletes' arms from a top-down perspective, their arms held close together in opposite directions." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UGosNsqRzmYD5MwP9PsuBC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="7774" height="4373" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Polar)</span></figcaption></figure><p>"We don't want to rent out our customers' data," said Polar account marketing specialist Michael Herlihy in an interview with Android Central about the Loop.</p><p>Polar claims that the Loop is "slim enough to share space with a traditional watch." If you want 24/7 health data but also prefer a luxury watch, you could try wearing them together, though the opposite wrist seems more natural.</p><p>I asked Herlihy why Polar chose a wristband instead of an armband like its own Verity Sense strap. He replied that the "ergonomics" of the wristband form factor feels more natural to users and that it provides much better activity tracking metrics.</p><div ><table><caption>Polar Loop specs</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Polar Loop</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Size</p></td><td  ><p>42 x 27 x 9mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>29g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Water resistance</p></td><td  ><p>WR30</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Operating temp</p></td><td  ><p>-20¬∫C to 50¬∫C (-4¬∫F to 122¬∫F)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery life</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 8 days standard use</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging</p></td><td  ><p>USB-C, rechargeable and replaceable Li-Pol battery (170mAh)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Bluetooth 5.1</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Sensors</p></td><td  ><p>Precision Prime optical HR, accelerometer</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Key data</p></td><td  ><p>Steps, distance, calories, active time, average and max HR, HRV, overnight recovery, sleep duration and stages, suggested bedtime, training load pro, fitness test, voice guidance</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The Polar Loop is splash-resistant, capable of withstanding a shower or a quick dunk in water, but it isn't designed for prolonged water sports, Herlihy warned.</p><p>It's packed with the same Polar Precision Prime HR sensor technology found in watches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/polar-vantage-v3-review">Polar Vantage V3</a>, meant to detect and counteract the effects of rapid arm movement and other factors that impact accuracy.</p><p>Because the Loop has no display, users will need to check the Polar Flow app to check things like their sleep scores, daily training load scores, and post-workout stats. Like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">smart ring</a>, it's meant to untether you from the annoyance of constant notifications while still keeping you healthy and motivated.</p><p>Polar will have a direct competitor in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit/amazfi-balance-2-helio-strap-combo-elevated-features-launch">Amazfit Helio Strap</a>, a $99 screenless, 24/7 workout band with 10 days of battery life (two more than the Polar Loop). Polar will be counting on fitness fans being familiar with its products and confident in its HR data to justify the higher cost.</p><p>Whoop bands have a wider range of health data, but cost significantly more over time, and the company is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/whoop-no-intention-dropping-its-blood-pressure-insights-fda-report">currently fighting with the FDA</a> over blood pressure data.

The suit was placed within the Delhi High Court in India. Ultrahuman argued that its competitor, Oura, was riding a little too close for comfort with its smart ring features, like "women‚Äôs health tracking, glucose monitoring, and non-paywalled data features without permission."</p><p>At the time, an Ultrahuman spokesperson said the company has "no choice but to defend its innovation." Aside from the "sleep, recovery, and circadian health" insights mentioned, Ultrahuman said there was another sharp divide between both brands: the use of paywalled and non-paywalled content.</p><p>The lawsuit brought to the Delhi High Court was Ultrahuman seeking to "defend" a specific patent and keep itself at the forefront of open health data. However, concerning Oura's paywalled content, it said locking "them behind a paywall is anti-innovation and anti-consumer."</p> ]]></dc:content>

There are only two phones where I feel the need to do so ‚Äî Pixels and iPhones. With just one iPhone model coming out yearly, I feel it's prudent to put a case on that device.</p><p>I tend to use Pixels the longest over the course of a year, and while Google shored up its build quality in the last two years, I've damaged enough of its devices in the past to be wary of breaking yet another phone. In fact, I had a minor scare just a day after getting the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review">Pixel 10 Pro XL</a>; the phone took a tumble onto a tiled floor, and while I was initially worried, there wasn't any damage ‚Äî thankfully.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="tR6sdmMkccA3AnPJWT7j6H" name="Bellroy Pixel 10 Leather Case" alt="Bellroy Pixel 10 Leather Case against colorful backgrounds on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tR6sdmMkccA3AnPJWT7j6H.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When I have to use a case, I prefer leather-backed choices, and that led me to Bellroy. I'm a big fan of the Bellroy's bags and accessories, and having taken the Transit Travel Pack Pro on a recent junket to London, I can attest to its efficacy at carrying a mountain of tech.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4833px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="G3uucYN7PteKHp7vjKdfqG" name="Bellroy Pixel 10 Leather Case" alt="Bellroy Pixel 10 Leather Case against colorful backgrounds on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/G3uucYN7PteKHp7vjKdfqG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4833" height="2722" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>So when I saw that the brand makes Pixel 10 leather cases, I was immediately interested. I got the Sienna color to use with my Pixel 10 Pro XL, and the Pixel 10 in Sapphire. Both colors look good, but the Sienna stands out just that little bit more. Bellroy partners with Google, so in addition to getting the case on the brand's site ‚Äî <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://bellroy.com/products/leather-pixel-case?color=sienna&material=leather&size=pixel10proxl">where it costs $59</a> ‚Äî you can also buy it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.google.com/us/product/bellroy_leather_case_magnet_pixel_10_pro">from the Google Store</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="WAyVfRwwWoGingpUoUTswG" name="Bellroy Pixel 10 Leather Case" alt="Bellroy Pixel 10 Leather Case against colorful backgrounds on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WAyVfRwwWoGingpUoUTswG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The case itself has a clean design, and it accentuates the camera bar of the Pixel 10 Pro XL, Other than the Bellroy logo at the bottom, there's no other labeling on the case, and the build quality is excellent. The leather feels good in-hand, and the best part is that it is considerably thinner than most leather cases I used in the past, so it doesn't add too much bulk to the phone.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="jxvcoZNB5hwtLmt92iDvBH" name="Bellroy Pixel 10 Leather Case" alt="Bellroy Pixel 10 Leather Case against colorful backgrounds on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jxvcoZNB5hwtLmt92iDvBH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Coming in at 30g, the leather case doesn't weigh much either. The inside of the case has felt lining to ensure it doesn't scratch the phone, and it has aluminum buttons that have the same great tactility as the buttons on the Pixel 10 Pro XL. There's enough clearance around the bottom cutout for the USB-C charging port that I was able to use my cable with an integrated power meter without any issues.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5060px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="Hubzj8YAjPdGtyRThukSzG" name="Bellroy Pixel 10 Leather Case" alt="Bellroy Pixel 10 Leather Case against colorful backgrounds on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Hubzj8YAjPdGtyRThukSzG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5060" height="2850" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Oh, and the case has built-in magnets. One of the best features on the Pixel 10 is that it has Qi 2 integration, and while you don't need to use a magnetic case, having one makes a difference. I didn't see any problems using the case with the dozen or so Qi 2 charging pads I have in the house.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5065px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="cQJiiCVzpMv7aWZTCNfLtG" name="Bellroy Pixel 10 Leather Case" alt="Bellroy Pixel 10 Leather Case against colorful backgrounds on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cQJiiCVzpMv7aWZTCNfLtG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5065" height="2853" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The case has raised edges at the front that ensure the panel doesn't take any damage should the phone fall face-down, and you get similar protection at the back around the cameras. I've been using the case for just a few days now, and I haven't run into any issues, but I will update the post with long-term usage notes. Bellroy provides a standard three-year warranty with all of its cases against manufacturing defects, so I don't see that being a problem.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="umv2MWxr8NoBDXboE2ywwG" name="Bellroy Pixel 10 Leather Case" alt="Bellroy Pixel 10 Leather Case against colorful backgrounds on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/umv2MWxr8NoBDXboE2ywwG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Overall, I really like what Bellroy did with its Pixel 10 cases. The build quality is great, the cases don't add much bulk or heft to the phones, and they look stylish. I also like the quality of the leather, and if you're eyeing Google's latest phones and need a reliable leather case, I'd recommend going with Bellroy ‚Äî this is one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/best-google-pixel-10-cases">best Pixel 10 cases</a> available.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="e0c8d35e-a42e-4200-8643-4af45734cd3e">            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FN77PCM8" data-model-name="Bellroy Pixel 10 Pro XL Leather Case" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:150%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YxRuanmox8ACueGSVfr4cJ.jpg' alt="Bellroy Pixel 10 Pro XL Leather Case"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Bellroy Pixel 10 Pro XL Leather Case</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Bellroy's Pixel 10 Pro XL leather case is one of the best available.

The post on the Chinese social media, Weibo, drew attention to the rumored "main" or "super" cores powering the next Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC "for Galaxy."</p><p>This chip, expected to focus on Samsung's phones, is rumored to reach speeds of 4.74GHz. The rumors call this a "high-frequency" version of what Qualcomm will make available for other OEMs, similar to what it's done in the past.</p><p>On the other hand, the tipster alleges that the regular Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 (the successor's supposed name) is being tested on devices from Xiaomi, Honor, iQOO, OnePlus, and RealMe. For now, the chip is supposedly reaching heights of 4.61GHz with its "two super cores," alongside six 3.63GHz "large cores."</p><h2 id="looking-ahead-to-the-elite-2">Looking ahead to the Elite</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2610px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:64.44%;"><img id="XjRF5FYu5b2mruEqArEGQh" name="Snapdragon-8-Elite-Gaming" alt="A photo showing a gaming phone with the Snapdragon 8 Elite logo hovering above it" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XjRF5FYu5b2mruEqArEGQh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2610" height="1682" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Compared to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-vs-regular-snapdragon-8-elite">what we got last year</a> with the 8 Elite "for Galaxy" and the base version, the numbers are slightly boosted. The original 8 Elite featured 4.47GHz clock speeds for the "for Galaxy" variant over the regular chip's 4.32GHz for other phone makers. If you're looking for more hard specs, neither Qualcomm nor Samsung shared those specifics.</p><p>Rumors <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-true-snapdragon-8-elite-2-2nm-process-qualcomm-chip-rumor">from June claimed</a> that Samsung may bring yet another "for Galaxy" chip to its Galaxy S26 series and that its Elite successor might run on the 2nm process. A report claimed that Samsung was already beginning to enter its "early production tests" for this upgraded "for Galaxy" chip on 2nm. Mass production could begin during "the second half of this year" if we're to believe the early whispers.</p><p>More recent rumors claim that Qualcomm could mix up its naming of its Snapdragon flagship, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/rumored-snapdragon-8-elite-name-change-confusing">which might leave us confused</a> when it arrives. Instead of going for the Snapdragon 8 Elite 2 moniker, rumors say it could debut as the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5. The reason for this is due to Qualcomm reportedly developing an SD 8 Gen 5 chipset, and looking to keep its chip's names within the same realm. Whatever may come, we might not have long to wait, as rumors claim Qualcomm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/early-snapdragon-8-elite-2-quicker-summit-phone-launch-rumors">could debut the chip in September</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

According to the publication, prominent U.S. Judge Amit Mehta, who's been involved in this case for quite some time, states that Google won't have to divest its Chrome and Android assets.</p><p>Mehta adds that "Plaintiffs overreached in seeking forced divestiture of these key assets, which Google did not use to effect any illegal restraints."</p><p>However, regarding the antitrust part of this ruling, Mehta's verdict states that, moving forward, Google will have to "share search data with competitors" within the online search space. More than that, Google is also "barred...from having exclusive contracts for its Google Search, Chrome, Google Assistant, and Gemini app products."</p><p>Business Insider also highlights a statement from Mehta about how the case had evolved over the past few months. In the case documents, Mehta stated that the "legal landscape" of the case had changed because of the introduction of "general artificial intelligence" in online search.</p><h2 id="the-journey-so-far-2">The journey so far...</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="CJgdRKwzJ3zkDjTVkNjHPj" name="google-ai-overviews-itinerary-example" alt="Google's AI Overviews can help users create itineraries for travel plans." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CJgdRKwzJ3zkDjTVkNjHPj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In August 2024, the DOJ stated that it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/us-doj-could-break-up-google-following-ruling">was seeking a way to solve this antitrust</a> online search case with Google, and that it could involve forcing the company to divest some assets. The DOJ had some options in mind, all of which involved having Google sell off Chrome <em>and </em>Android. However, there was another choice: share more data with the competition.

With IFA 2025 under way, Acer decided it was time to reveal a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebook</a> and even two new Chromeboxes, in addition to all of the products that fall outside of the Android/ChromeOS purview.</p><p>Headlining Acer's IFA 2025 announcements is the all-new Chromebook Plus Spin 514. Although the general design might look the same, the Spin 514 gets a fresh coat of paint to celebrate being the first Acer Chromebook powered by the MediaTek Kompanio Ultra 910.</p><div ><table><caption>Acer Chromebook Plus Spin 514 Specs</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol empty" ></th><th  ><p>Acer Chromebook Plus Spin 514</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>14-inch, 2880x1800 (WQXGA+), 16:10, 60Hz (120Hz optional)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>MediaTek Kompanio Ultra 910</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 16GB LPDDR5X</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 256GB UFS 4.0</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Webcam</p></td><td  ><p>5MP (10MP optional)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 17 hours (70Wh)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ports</p></td><td  ><p>2x USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C, 2x USB 3.2 Gen 1, 3.5mm Audio Jack</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>313 x 232 x 15.5mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>2.99lbs</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Price</p></td><td  ><p>$699.99</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>This marks just the second Chromebook to make use of this chip, as it first arrived in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/lenovo-chromebook-plus-14-hands-on">Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14</a> earlier this year. However, Acer's offering might be a bit more appealing to some, thanks to its convertible design and USI-compatible display.</p><p>As we've seen with the Chromebook Plus 14, the Kompanio Ultra 910 is an absolute beast capable of handling practically anything you throw at it. And on top of that, this MediaTek chip offers quite a boost to AI performance, as its 50 TOPS of AI processing enables <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> to flex its muscles without needing to rely on the cloud.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1196px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="prU3cENJvzM2WtQeK67hvM" name="acer-chromebook-plus-spin-514-lifestyle-2" alt="Acer Chromebook Plus Spin 514 announcement lifestyle image" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/prU3cENJvzM2WtQeK67hvM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1196" height="673" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Acer)</span></figcaption></figure><p>But what good is having all of the performance if you have to constantly be plugged in? Thankfully, that won't be a problem with the Spin 514 thanks to the 70Wh battery which Acer rates to last for up to 17 hours on a single charge.</p><p>The fun doesn't stop there, as Acer's latest Chromebook is equipped with a convertible design, while the touchscreen display features <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-stylus-chromebook">USI 2.0</a> compatibility. All of this makes for an incredible Chromebook for everyone, even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook-students">students</a> who need something lightweight, portable, and versatile.</p><p>Pricing for the Chromebook Plus Spin 514 starts at $699, and you'll get 12 months of Google's AI Pro plan for free. We can expect to see Acer's new Chromebook arrive sometime in October.</p><h2 id="not-one-but-two-new-chromeboxes-2">Not one, but TWO new Chromeboxes</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eqjEPmkcoc5gbDa6c6mboN" name="acer-chromebox-cxi6-lifestyle-4" alt="Acer Chromebox CXI6 lifestyle image" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eqjEPmkcoc5gbDa6c6mboN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Acer)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's not all that often that we get a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebox">Chromebox</a>, let alone two. But, that's exactly what Acer is doing at IFA 2025, as the Chromebox CXI6 and Chromebox Mini CXM2 have both been unveiled.</p><p>There are some slight differences between the two options, starting with the Chromebox CXI6 having four different processors to choose from. The entry-level model is powered by the 13th Gen Intel Core i3-1305U, with the high-end model being powered by the Intel Core 7 150U. Meanwhile, the Mini CXM2 comes in three configurations with the Intel N150, N250, and Core 3 N350.</p><div ><table><caption>Acer Chromebox CXI6 & Mini CXM2 Specs</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol empty" ></th><th  ><p>Acer Chromebox CXI6</p></th><th  ><p>Acer Chromebox Mini CXM2</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor(s)</p></td><td  ><p>Intel Core i3-1305U, Core 3 100U, Core 5 120U, Core 7 150U</p></td><td  ><p>Intel N150, N250, Core 3 N350</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 16GB DDR4</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 16GB LPDDR5X</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 256GB M.2 PCIe SSD</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 128GB eMMC</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Front Ports</p></td><td  ><p>3x USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A, 1x USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C, SD Card, Audio Jack</p></td><td  ><p>3x USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Ports</p></td><td  ><p>2x USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A, 1x USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C, 2x HDMI 2.1, 1x DisplayPort, 2.5G LAN</p></td><td  ><p>2x USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A, 2x USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C, 2x HDMI 2.1, LAN, Audio Jack</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, 2.5G LAN</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, Gigabit Ethernet</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>VESA Mount Compatible</p></td><td  ><p>‚úÖ (Mount Kit Optional)</p></td><td  ><p>‚úÖ (Mount Kit Optional)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>166.5 x 165.8 x 43.8mm</p></td><td  ><p>161.26 x 119.85 x 33.9mm</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Both of these Chromebox models max out with 16GB of RAM, and that's where most of the important similarities stop. The CXI6 supports up to 256GB of storage courtesy of an M.2 SSD, while the Mini CXM2 maxes out with 128GB of eMMC storage.</p><p>If you need more proof of that the CXI6 is slightly more versatile, look no further than the 13 ports found on the front and back. On the other hand, the CXM2 packs three USB-A ports on the front, and eight more on the back, potentially offering a "cleaner" look than the CXI6.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zKjv5d9JKSL6wWW8YtSAsN" name="acer-chromebox-cxi6-lifestyle-2" alt="Acer Chromebox CXI6 lifestyle image" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zKjv5d9JKSL6wWW8YtSAsN.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Acer)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="v6QzjCMCYe2PcZDF3bbwhC" name="acer-chromebox-mini-cxm2-lifestyle-1" alt="Acer Chromebox Mini CXM2 lifestyle image" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v6QzjCMCYe2PcZDF3bbwhC.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Acer)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Truth be told, neither of these are going to blow you away in terms of performance, but they'll make for great everyday computers. Plus, both of these Chromeboxes are compatible with VESA mounts, but you will need to pick up Acer's VESA Mount Kit separately.</p><p>The Chromebox CXI6 is slated to arrive in December, with a starting retail price of $519.99. As for the Chromebox Mini CXM2, you'll have to wait a bit longer, as it's not expected to be released until sometime in Q1 2026, and will set you back about $329.</p><ul><li><strong>Chromebook Deals:¬†</strong><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1690538&xcust=ac_us_9829528799339934187&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1943169%2F565706%2F9383%3FsubId1%3Dac-us-1138849555607607513%26sharedId%3Dac-us%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.walmart.com%252Fbrowse%252Felectronics%252Fgoogle-chromebooks%252F3944_3951_1089430_1230091_1103213&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.androidcentral.com%2Fchromebooks-laptops%2Fsnapdragon-x-plus-chromebooks-may-soon-become-a-reality" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://shop-links.co/link?id=pcat17071&st=chromebook&publisher_slug=future&exclusive=1&u1=ac-us-1049940027559197753&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsearchpage.jsp%3Fid%3Dpcat17071%26st%3Dchromebook&article_name=Best%20back%20to%20school%20tech%20deals%202023%20%E2%80%94%20Chromebooks%2C%20smartphones%2C%20watches%2C%20and%20more&article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.androidcentral.com%2Fchromebooks-laptops%2Fbest-back-to-school-tech-deals-2023-chromebooks-smartphones-watches-and-more" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://lenovo.7eer.net/c/221109/218864/3808?subId1=ac-us-1444465790693541350&sharedId=ac-us&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fd%2Fchromebook-laptop%2F" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>Lenovo</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100048248-15852945?sid=ac-us-1271264508971809203&url=https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/mlp/laptops/chromebook-344506--1" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>HP</strong></a><strong>|¬†</strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fstores%2Fpage%2F8667F8E9-10FC-4DCC-AB6A-97566CE718A5%3Fingress%3D0%26visitId%3D46ceb076-1b26-4ec4-8324-90885a489a11%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-4420679271272975345-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>Amazon</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Google and Samsung are the major players, but brands like OnePlus are giving Wear OS another go, too. That's great news for smartwatch buyers ‚Äî there's never been a better time to be in the market for a new one. Two of the best options are sure to be the Google Pixel Watch 4 and the OnePlus Watch 3.</p><p>Both Google and OnePlus were slow to offer their flagship smartwatches in multiple sizes, but now, you can get the Pixel Watch 4 and OnePlus Watch 3 in big or small packages. They each offer a different feature set, with Google doubling down on Fitbit and OnePlus prioritizing battery life. Let's break down exactly how two of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">best Wear OS smartwatches</a> compare to help you decide which one is right for you.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-watch-4-vs-oneplus-watch-3-design-and-display-2">Google Pixel Watch 4 vs. OnePlus Watch 3: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4005px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Ri39J2VrcjKLvN83mzHsbb" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-4-Fitbit-Steps-Tile-yellow" alt="Pixel Watch 4 Fitbit Steps Tile in yellow" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ri39J2VrcjKLvN83mzHsbb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4005" height="2253" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/google-pixel-watch-4-hands-on">Google Pixel Watch 4</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-review">OnePlus Watch 3</a> are distinct in terms of design. Google's smartwatch has a dainty and chic appearance, somewhat reminiscent of old analog watches. Even the larger 45mm version retains its elegance, featuring a domed glass and display that seamlessly flow into the circular aluminum chassis. By comparison, the OnePlus Watch 3 has a louder design language that also resembles analog watches, but on the other end of the spectrum.</p><p>The smaller 43mm OnePlus Watch 3 has a more subdued appearance, similar to the Pixel Watch 3, but without the domed glass. However, the original OnePlus Watch 3 is a massive 46.6mm smartwatch that looks huge on most wrists. It has a metal bezel with dial markings that protect the digital OLED display. There's also a set of two buttons on both sizes that now rotate for software navigation.</p><p>As you'll see in the comparison below, both sizes of the OnePlus Watch 3 are flashy and tough, but the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch/oneplus-watch-3-43mm-hands-on">43mm OnePlus Watch 3</a> is certainly more subtle.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vnCFbE4yji9bt6H4KH5ZUS" name="oneplus-watch-3-43mm-vs-46mm-front-wearing-02" alt="Comparing the size of the OnePlus Watch 3 46mm and 43mm on the same wrist" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vnCFbE4yji9bt6H4KH5ZUS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Comparing the size of the OnePlus Watch 3 46mm and 43mm on the same wrist. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Google Pixel Watch 4 is available in 41mm and 45mm sizes, which are smaller than the respective offerings of the OnePlus Watch 3. It sports an Actua 360 AMOLED LTPO display, and the screen is actually domed to match the cover glass this year. It supports a peak brightness rating of 3,000 nits and a  1-60Hz variable refresh rate. As such, the Pixel Watch 4 will be brighter and more visible outdoors.</p><p>The OnePlus Watch 3 also uses an LTPO AMOLED display, but this one features a 466x466 resolution and a 2,200-nit peak brightness rating. It's just as good as the Google display, albeit not as bright, which may be a concern during workouts in direct sunlight.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3248px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vwNzwni9pwToyWLQmkMZYb" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-4-sensors" alt="Pixel Watch 4 sensors on the back" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vwNzwni9pwToyWLQmkMZYb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3248" height="1827" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The OnePlus Watch 3 is decidedly more durable, packing a stainless steel chassis and sapphire-crystal glass.

For a limited time, you can buy the S25 Edge unlocked and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Processor-ProScaler-Manufacturer/dp/B0DYVMMM8C"><strong>score an outstanding $400 off your purchase,</strong></a> no strings attached.¬†</p><p>This unexpected deal from Amazon drops the phone to only $699, which is a full $100 cheaper than the base model S25. Why did Amazon drop a record-smashing discount on the Galaxy S25 Edge completely out of the blue and <em>after</em> its Labor Day sale? I have no idea, but there's literally never been a better time to buy the ultra-lightweight smartphone, so I'm not about to question it.¬†</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="fa84dcab-9afd-4b2a-a0e9-109a208c88f8" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,099.99" data-dimension48="$1,099.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Processor-ProScaler-Manufacturer/dp/B0DYVMMM8C" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="6qR9jhpW8ExE78Mxtp6TGf" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-official-render-titanium-jetblack" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6qR9jhpW8ExE78Mxtp6TGf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="3000" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge 256GB:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Processor-ProScaler-Manufacturer/dp/B0DYVMMM8C" data-dimension112="fa84dcab-9afd-4b2a-a0e9-109a208c88f8" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,099.99" data-dimension48="$1,099.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$1,099.99</del> <strong>$699.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>Completely apropos of nothing, Amazon is carving $400 off the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge, suddenly making the ultra-thin phone the cheapest device in the S25 lineup.

The phone clocks in at just 5.8mm of thickness and weighs 25% less than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>, but you still get the same Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, 12GB of RAM, and all of the latest Galaxy AI software features.¬†</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ECSmSHQksozF4ZQPvUWw8a" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-4" alt="The front of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ECSmSHQksozF4ZQPvUWw8a.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Galaxy S25 Edge also boasts a durable titanium frame with a 6.7-inch Super AMOLED display (constructed from Gorilla Glass) and an IP68 water/dust resistance rating. Like other great <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> released this year, the Galaxy S25 Edge also comes with seven years of OS and security upgrades straight out of the box.</p><p>Of course, all of that extra weight has to go somewhere, and if you continue to compare <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-vs-galaxy-s25-ultra">the Galaxy S25 Edge with the S25 Ultra</a>, it's obvious that the more-expensive phone beats the Edge in battery life and camera performance. But should you spend over $1,000 to fix those minor issues? I certainly wouldn't.¬†</p><p>In fact, while this 36% discount is active, the S25 Edge is the <em>only</em> Samsung phone that I'd consider buying today. The Galaxy S25 Edge is an absolute beast when it comes to overall design and ergonomics, and this deal makes it an absolute steal.¬†</p> ]]></dc:content>

This new module, the ISOCELL HPB, is an evolution of the HP9 engineered specifically for Vivo, which marks a step forward in camera hardware.</p><p>While 2025 is full of capable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-camera">camera phones</a>, Vivo's X300 Pro is already making a case for itself. The device will carry forward the critical 200MP 85mm periscope shooter that established the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">X200 Pro</a> and Ultra as low-light telephoto leaders, as confirmed by Vivo product manager Han Boxiao on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/3657968361/Q2FFu5lXj" target="_blank">Weibo</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/vivo-x300-pro-official-confirmed-3593428/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>).</p><p>For the X300 Pro's 200MP zoom, Vivo confirmed two key hardware upgrades. The ZEISS T* coating tackles stray light and reflections for cleaner images, while the fluorite glass element steps in to keep chromatic distortion in check.</p><p>Han admits the X300 Pro isn't a blanket upgrade over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x200-ultra-review">X200 Ultra</a>. Where it wins? Four key things: it's more stable, faster, and delivers superior clarity and transparency.</p><h2 id="sharper-images-with-multi-frame-fusion-2">Sharper images with multi-frame fusion</h2><p>Vivo claims the X300 Pro's stabilization has achieved a CIPA 5.5 rating, which it states is the highest certification in the industry. The company is also developing custom focus-changing engines with partners to enable precise motion capture from ultra-long distances, while upgraded processing allows for high-pixel multi-frame fusion.</p><p>Co-developed with platform manufacturers, the X300 Pro‚Äôs focus-tracking engine is said to deliver faster and more reliable subject capture, even at extreme distances.</p><p>The X300 Pro's telephoto is engineered for optical-grade results, not artificial sharpening. Through exclusive Blueprint algorithms and full-stack optimization, it captures longer-range shots that are both clearer and look naturally authentic. This is backed by a ZEISS-coated, fluorite glass, APO-certified system.</p><p>At its core, the X300 Pro is tipped to run on the MediaTek Dimensity 9500. For its main camera, Vivo selected the Sony LYT-828, a 50MP sensor whose large 1/1.3-inch size and advanced architecture deliver standout HDR capabilities.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Hints of a redesign popped up earlier this year, and now, after months of waiting, users are finally seeing the updated look. First spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-quick-share-update-rolling-out-3592689/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, the refresh gives the file-sharing tool a much-needed polish.</p><p>The redesign matches <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/my-8-favorite-things-about-the-one-ui-8-beta">One UI 8</a>‚Äôs Quick Share layout, featuring a full-screen view with separate tabs for sending and receiving files, as seen in the screenshots below.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:404px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:213.86%;"><img id="xREc7tQr7WDHfYTKRuMt8H" name="Android-Quick-Share" alt="refreshed Quick Share interface on Android" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xREc7tQr7WDHfYTKRuMt8H.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="404" height="864" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:404px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:213.86%;"><img id="5avSYevQKwtkzwnPtd2u8H" name="Android-Quick-Share" alt="refreshed Quick Share interface on Android" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5avSYevQKwtkzwnPtd2u8H.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="404" height="864" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><h2 id="small-tweaks-big-convenience-gains-2">Small tweaks, big convenience gains</h2><p>In contrast, the old Quick Share was just a settings page for tweaking your device name and visibility.

Select multiple files, and you‚Äôll see a preview of them upfront. The layout keeps the ‚ÄúSend to your devices‚Äù and ‚ÄúSend to nearby devices‚Äù sections, with the latter tucked at the bottom.</p><p>Google is said to be testing the update on a handful of devices, with a full rollout still on hold. This release continues last year‚Äôs effort to streamline Android‚Äôs wireless sharing by combining Nearby Share and Quick Share into a unified platform.</p><p>There‚Äôs still no exact date for a full Quick Share rollout, but with devices already receiving the update, it‚Äôs likely just around the corner.</p><p>Quick Share has expanded well beyond <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phones</a>, with Apple ecosystem support in testing. For users managing multiple devices, it‚Äôs become a go-to tool for being secure, fast, and deeply integrated into Android.

A similar issue appeared on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-says-galaxy-z-fold-6-paint-is-peeling-due-to-unofficial-chargers">some Galaxy Z Fold 6 models</a> last year, to which Samsung replied that poorly grounded high-speed third-party chargers can "deteriorate the anodization" (the phone's protective metal finish).</p><p>The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/ca/support/mobile-devices/third-party-products-causing-paint-to-peel-off-galaxy-devices/">said</a> non-official chargers can sometimes cause current leakage, corroding the surface and leading to "delamination of the paint" and eventual paint peeling off the device.</p><div><blockquote><p>Using a high-speed third-party charger that isn‚Äôt properly grounded can lead to leakage currents that deteriorate the anodization (a protective and aesthetic finish on metal surfaces) of your Galaxy device. This may result in the delamination of the paint. To ensure the longevity and appearance of your device, we strongly recommend using only official Samsung chargers, which are specifically designed to prevent such issues.</p></blockquote></div><p>However, what's puzzling is that one Galaxy Z Fold 7 user on Reddit claims to be using Samsung's official 25W charger, so the issue could be different this time. Some users even suggest Samsung hasn't "treated the aluminum properly" this time, and the "anodized layer didn't form properly," causing the paint to flake.</p><p>For now, the issue seems limited to only a small number of devices, but it's still concerning to see a $2,000 flagship experiencing paint chipping just a month after launch. Samsung hasn't officially acknowledged the issue yet, but we'll update you as soon as we hear from the brand.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Theoretically, the turritopsis is immortal because it can regenerate endlessly, allowing it to adapt to death literally. It‚Äôs a fascinating species, go Google it (after you finish reading this).</p><p>Embodying millions of years of evolution, Hidizs chose the jellyfish as a symbol of the sonic evolution of this inexpensive, entry-level audiophile-grade pair of IEMs. They are highly adaptable, an evolution of design with their M-shaped dome Magnesium diaphragm, and aesthetically intriguing. When you first open the meticulously packaged box, you‚Äôre greeted by the two IEM units that <em>feel</em> heavy in hand, but are supremely comfortable in-ear.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="EgutyBZHeNjKk7QKmC4zri" name="" alt="Hidizs MK12 Turris various ear tips" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EgutyBZHeNjKk7QKmC4zri.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>After you remove the units and the top layer of packaging, the next layer contains the nine pairs of ear tips. Three sets, each with distinctive sonic properties. One set emphasizes vocal ranges, the next for a balanced sound, and one set for a bass-forward experience.</p><p>The ‚Äúadaptability‚Äù doesn‚Äôt end there. You also get two pairs of tuning filters in the box. The default pair already installed on the MK12s is Rose Gold for balanced listening. They represent what Hidizs calls their ‚Äúsignature style.‚Äù Then there‚Äôs the Silent Silver, which enhances smoothness in the high frequencies, and their Enchanting Red filter, which enhances low-frequency sounds.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="T5WBzc8XBUfD8bfqUqPHRh" name="" alt="Hidizs MK12 Turris red tuning filter" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/T5WBzc8XBUfD8bfqUqPHRh.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zjJnJAteJf43ACUFzsrzfL" name="hidisz-mk12-tuning-filters" alt="Hidizs MK12 Turris additional tuning filters" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zjJnJAteJf43ACUFzsrzfL.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>I found myself enjoying the Enchanting Red filters most, but was torn between the vocal and the bass-enhancing ear tips. The difference between the two was subtle, but I ended up spending more time with the red filter mated to the bass ear tips. I didn‚Äôt notice any loss of clarity or detail in the treble, but I did gain greater depth and energy in the lows, especially the sub-bass.</p><p>Rounding out the rest of the kit is your choice of a 2-pin high-purity oxygen-free copper cable terminating in either a 3.5mm or 4.4mm balanced connection. When you have the option and equipment to drive it, I recommend always choosing the 2.5mm or 4.4mm balanced cable.</p><h2 id="this-jellyfish-has-some-backbone-2">This jellyfish has some backbone</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="Wywedc6PwsbtSQCrXgnQ5W" name="hidisz-mk12-turris-cable-connector.JPG" alt="Hidizs MK12 Turris showing the two-pin connector for the cables" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Wywedc6PwsbtSQCrXgnQ5W.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Other reviews</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>-</strong> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-fh11-review" target="_blank"><strong>Fiio FH11 review: Stylish entry-level IEMs with a fun sound</strong></a></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/review-astell-and-kern-activo-p1"><strong>Activo P1 review: The DAP that's all that</strong></a></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/review-questyle-m18i"><strong>Illuminating sound.

The listening experience is delightfully immersive for a pair of IEMs in this price range, and I‚Äôve listened to some that cost more than twice as much and didn‚Äôt do as good a job.</p><p>One of the first songs I listened to was Charles Mingus‚Äô ‚ÄúMoanin‚Äô‚Äù and the MK12 did not disappoint. Upper mids gave me details I hadn‚Äôt noticed in this highly frenetic Jazz composition. Some off-mic vocal riffs, some fingering of a saxophone‚Äôs keys, and other ambient sonic details that help feel like you‚Äôre sitting in the studio while the band is recording.</p><p>I can definitely say that upper mids are prominent with these IEMs. That bump in the upper mids also gave greater gravitas to the guitars in System of a Down‚Äôs ‚ÄúToxicity.‚Äù It‚Äôs already one of my favorite metal hype songs, and if it‚Äôs headbanging that you‚Äôre after, you‚Äôll want to put your skull through drywall with the Turris in your ears.</p><p>But what about the lows? Tight. Controlled. Deep and dark, thanks to the filter and ear tip combination I‚Äôve chosen. Acoustic and orchestral tracks have weight to their basslines and instrumentation that has texture and impact. Tracks mastered with deep bass like The Roots‚Äô ‚ÄúDo You Want More?!?!!‚Äù and Skrillex‚Äôs ‚ÄúSupersonic‚Äù have delightful resonance with the added benefit of comfortable enjoyment!</p><p>The shells of the Turris IEMs have pressure release ports, and I could feel the difference as the bass cannons in the song ‚ÄúMumbai Power‚Äù slammed my eardrums. With most other headphones, the pressure from the booming sub-bass hits slam against your eardrums, but those ports made a world of difference, allowing me to spend extended periods with high-quality masters of sub-bass-heavy music.</p><p>When it comes to DAPs, I like a bit of sparkle in the top end, but the MK12 Turris‚Äô treble is a bit too smooth, to the point of feeling constrained. I don‚Äôt know if that has anything to do with the rigidity of the Magnesium diaphragm, but it was something I noticed that became apparent as I went through my classical music test selections.</p><h2 id="x-gon-give-it-to-ya-2">X gon‚Äô give it to ya!</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="aypri3BNX8eZRHvS44dhUZ" name="hidisz-ap80-pro-x-interface-home.JPG" alt="Hidizs AP80 PRO-X DAP home screen number one" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aypri3BNX8eZRHvS44dhUZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Hidizs AP80 PRO-X</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>Samsung 2.45" (480x360) IPS HD touchscreen</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Supported Audio Formats</p></td><td  ><p>WAV, FLAC, WMA, MP3, OGG, APE, AAC, ALAC, AIFF, Formats DFF, DSF, MQA</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Sampling Rate</p></td><td  ><p>PCM : 8kHz ~ 384kHz (8/16/24/32bits per Sample)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Decoding</p></td><td  ><p>DSD Native: DSD64, DSD128, DSD256</p><p>PCM 384kHz/32Bit</p><p>MQA decoding</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>DAC</p></td><td  ><p>ESS ES9219C x2 (Dual DAC)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Input</p></td><td  ><p>USB-C, support two-way USB DAC</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Outputs</p></td><td  ><p>Unbalance Out (3.5mm), Balance Out (2.5mm)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>EQ</p></td><td  ><p>Xbands, 8 EQ presets, Save custom EQ support, MSEB w/10 tuning functions</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Bluetooth</p></td><td  ><p>Bidirectional Bluetooth 4.2, CSR APT-X and Sony LDAC</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>Built-in, none;  512GB external via microSD</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>800mAh 3.7V Li-polymer battery</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Supported OS</p></td><td  ><p>Windows 10, 11 (32bit/64bit) / MacOS X 10.7 / iPad OS, iOS    </p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Some music lovers are looking to simplify life with distraction-free listening and are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/audio/best-mp3-players" target="_blank">rediscovering ‚ÄúMP3 Players' now called DAPs</a>, which often handle all types of wired and wireless audio formats.</p><p>Regarding <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/review-astell-and-kern-activo-p1" target="_blank">the best DAPs</a>, the Hidizs AP80 PRO-X is an entry-level DAP priced at $180, available in black, blue, and gray options.

It looks like that is taking shape as Samsung has started rolling out the One UI 8 beta for Galaxy S23 and A-series smartphones.</p><p>As spotted by popular Samsung tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/tarunvats33/status/1962414394744451380">Tarun Vats on X/Twitter</a>, Samsung has begun rolling out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/my-8-favorite-things-about-the-one-ui-8-beta">One UI 8</a> beta for the Galaxy S23 series in India and South Korea. The update is hefty at around 3GB+ and comes with the latest September 2025 security patch.</p><p>According to one <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS23Ultra/comments/1n5i0ut/comment/nbsytxg/">Reddit user</a>, the update seems to be available in the UK as well, but there's no news for regions like Germany and the U.S. However, considering it has started in a few countries, it should be available elsewhere soon.</p><p>If you want to try the One UI 8 beta on your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-vs-galaxy-s23">Galaxy S23</a>, you can do so by signing up using the Samsung Members app first and then downloading it via <strong>Settings > Software Update > Download and Install</strong>. The firmware version for the One UI 8 beta based on Android 16 for the Galaxy S23 series is "YHB.".</p><h2 id="one-ui-8-beta-is-live-on-galaxy-s23-a55-a54-and-more-2">One UI 8 beta is live on Galaxy S23, A55, A54, and more</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HhusjRhZmuV2a4LmQCugXX" name="one-ui-8-beta-s23" alt="One UI 8 beta update on Galaxy S23" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HhusjRhZmuV2a4LmQCugXX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tarun Vats / X)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung announced last month that it would expand One UI 8 testing to older smartphones, and the Galaxy S23 beta follows that. The Galaxy S23 joins devices like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-one-year-later">Galaxy S24</a>, Galaxy S25, Galaxy Z Flip 6, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, which have already been testing One UI 8.</p><p>In addition to the Galaxy S23 series, Samsung has started testing One UI 8 beta for some mid-range devices, including Galaxy A55, Galaxy A54, Galaxy A36, and Galaxy A35. This is notable since Samsung hasn't started testing One UI 8 for the Galaxy Z Fold 5 and Z Flip 5, but has expanded the program to mid-range devices first. We still expect <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-is-finally-selling-the-z-fold-5-certified-re-newed-on-its-website-but-is-it-worth-it">Z Fold 5</a> and Z Flip 5 support sooner or later.</p><p>One UI 8 is Samsung's flavor of Android 16, and while the company lagged in rolling out One UI 7 (Android 15), it is testing the new version comparatively faster for its flagships.

All three phones in the flagship line ‚Äî which includes the standard Pixel 10, the Pixel 10 Pro, and the Pixel 10 Pro XL ‚Äî are powered by the new Google Tensor G5 chipset, plus you get an upgraded triple camera system, a bunch of new AI-powered software features, and seven years of OS and security upgrades guaranteed. The Pixel 10 is also the first major Android phone to sport Qi2 MagSafe support.</p><p>There were a few choices that some Android fans may not appreciate, such as removing the physical SIM card tray, but these are pretty minor issues when you look at the overall package here. The big question is if you should upgrade if you're already the proud owner of a Pixel 9. Fortunately, we built a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-vs-pixel-9">Pixel 10 vs Pixel 9 guide</a> to address this very problem.

As the rumor implies, this seems to be our final dance with One UI 7 (Android 15) before <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/how-install-one-ui-beta">One UI 8 (Android 16)</a> finally arrives. Vats didn't have more to say about the update itself, like what it would entail.</p><p>However, in response to one user, Vats said the patch should arrive "soon." Others started speculating, wondering if we could see the major One UI 8 toward the final week of September or, perhaps, into early October. Samsung's continued its One UI 8 beta in August, while also fixing quite a problematic camera issue.</p><h2 id="one-ui-8-waiting-room-2">One UI 8 waiting room</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Uy8kf5a4mUAHnDdgksiEBh" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-ui-8-beta-1-04" alt="Updating to One UI 8 on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Uy8kf5a4mUAHnDdgksiEBh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The company had a bit of an issue in August, as users reported a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/one-ui-8-latest-beta-bug-drenches-moon-photos-in-a-purple-hue">strange purple tint</a> when photographing the moon in One UI 8 Beta 4. It was a bug that plagued testers with a Galaxy S25 Ultra when zooming in by 30x, 50x, and 100x with the Intelligent Optimization setting enabled. Others had this purple tint occur even with different settings.</p><p>Samsung encouraged users to provide as much information as possible via its Members app.</p><p>While we thought Beta 4 would mark the end of things, Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/one-ui-8-beta-5-for-samsung-galaxy-s25">rolled out Beta 5</a> in August. It was a huge 1.78GB update that brought a host of bug fixes to its latest flagship line in preparation for Android 16. Samsung fixed problems with its DND (do not disturb), Now Brief content, Quick Settings window, and more. With Beta 5 in hand, there's speculation that One UI 8 will roll out officially sometime in September.</p><p>It lines up with what we've heard from Tarun Vats, so maybe we're actually seeing Android 16 on the horizon.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>
