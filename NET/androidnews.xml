According to Google, this app integration will let users "schedule meetings, see location details, and more without leaving the page you’re on." For YouTube, users can ask Gemini to summarize the video and receive a bulleted list of its key points, as well as timestamps so you can go and see for yourself.</p><p>Android and iOS users can expect this major update "soon." Google states users on Android can activate Gemini by holding the power button. For iOS, Gemini in Chrome will be built into the app.</p><p>Google's powerful AI Search is also headed to Chrome's address bar, also known as its omnibox.</p><h2 id="ai-mode-reaches-chrome-2">AI Mode reaches Chrome</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1075px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.81%;"><img id="ifKqgaB2x2fS2UNwGV2hhW" name="google-chrome-ai-mode-omnibox" alt="Users can find AI Mode in Chrome's omnibox (address bar), which can offer suggested questions about the page you're viewing, while also giving you the chance to ask your own." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ifKqgaB2x2fS2UNwGV2hhW.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1075" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1071px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.02%;"><img id="afxVHk2gpxTpuqSr2uPnhW" name="google-chrome-ai-mode-omnibox-ai-overview" alt="After asking AI Mode a question from Chrome's address bar, users will be given an AI Overview of answers directly on the page, via a sidebar." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/afxVHk2gpxTpuqSr2uPnhW.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1071" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Rolling out "later this month" in the U.S., users browsing on the web will find an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/ai-mode-levels-up-with-new-ai-features-stealing-google-searchs-spotlight">AI Mode</a> option when interacting with Chrome's address bar. You'll find similar capabilities to AI Mode through Search, like the ability to ask longer, complex questions with the added ability to ask a follow-up. While the U.S. (in English) will be the first to receive this, Google says it plans to expand AI Mode in the omnibox to more countries and support more languages in the weeks after.</p><p>Outside of AI Mode's stronger search capabilities, the omnibox is getting a useful overhaul, as it understands the context of the page you're browsing. Google says users can now ask questions about the webpage they're on using the address bar (omnibox). Users will receive an "AI Overview from Search right alongside the page, with the ability to ask follow-up questions in AI Mode."</p><p>The post teases that Chrome can even suggest questions for you, based on the page you're looking at. Also, Google's post states that users can still use the address bar as they normally would before this AI Mode. You have the choice to utilize this additional, powerful version of Search if needed.</p><h2 id="gemini-aims-to-protect-2">Gemini aims to protect</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1072px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.97%;"><img id="rZfj5zfRBk7ycS6AwchEqh" name="google-chrome-gemini-security-compromised-password" alt="Google's enhanced AI-backed security can help identify if a user's password has been compromised, and fix it for them." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rZfj5zfRBk7ycS6AwchEqh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1072" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/chrome/chrome-reimagined-with-ai/">subsequent post by Google</a>, the company highlighted the improved security parameters headed for Chrome.

These are an upgrade over Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2), as they provide an in-lens display, more advanced camera features, and an included neural band for gesture support.</p><p>Notably, the name begins with Meta instead of Ray-Ban this time around, signalling that these glasses are more focused on capability than style — although they still sport much sleeker, Ray-Ban style frames than <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Meta Orion</a>.</p><p>Meta is getting a leg-up on Google and Amazon in a big way with this release, as it marks the first time Meta is shipping a pair of smart glasses with a display. That display turns this into a sort of "smartwatch for your face" since it still connects to your phone, but has plenty of capability all on its own, too.</p><p>Meta also launched a more affordable pair of AI glasses called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-gen-2">Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2)</a>, which are more focused on style with cameras and audio-based AI at the forefront, and a sportier pair called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oakley-meta-vanguard-smart-glasses-hands-on">Oakley Meta Vanguard</a>, which is geared towards athletes who want extra-long battery life, IP67 protection, and more.

The biggest difference between them is the thickness of the frames, as they have to fit a display in the right lenses, plus additional computing hardware and a larger battery than the Ray-Ban Meta or Oakley Meta glasses.</p><p>In his private demo, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-ray-ban-display-hands-on-demo-impressions">Android Central's Michael Hicks said</a> the thicker frames don't look like some of the other smart glasses we've seen to date. "If not for the camera cutouts, people might assume it's a stylistic choice."</p><p>The glasses feature one camera on the side of one lens and an LED indicator on the other side, giving them a uniform look. At 69g, these are just 17g heavier than Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) AI glasses, a real win for Meta and something that should help everyday comfort. Hicks noted that while they are comfortable to wear, you might want to invest in one of Meta's AI glasses for workouts, instead, as these are a bit heavy for that function.</p><div

glasses by including a display in the lower half of the right lens. This display lets you interact with the glasses in a visual way and even gives you a camera viewfinder, a key upgrade from Ray-Ban Meta glasses.</p><p>Despite being transparent, this display gets brighter than you might think. Hicks said, "Meta's team had me look at content against a sunny pavement and blue sky, and it automatically adjusted the brightness and tone so that I never had trouble with readability or colors."</p><p>You can also expect full privacy with this display, as it's impossible to see it from the other side. Only the person wearing it can see the display, and that's by design. Think of it like a one-way mirror, except here the lenses are transparent and the display is fully invisible from the outside.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div

message on his Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses with barely perceptible movements of his hand. This was possible thanks to the neural band that ships with the glasses, a type of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-semg-wristband-whitepaper">gesture band</a> we previously got to test out with Meta Orion at Meta Connect 2024.</p><p>This sEMG band is made of comfortable textiles that are rated for long-term use, are easy to clean, and sport an 18-hour battery life. The band can understand electrical impulses in your wrist muscles, translating that to gestures that allow you to "magically" interact with the Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses.</p><p>The band is hyper-sensitive and can infer even tiny movements, so you can discreetly flip through and reply to messages even in a meeting without anyone knowing. On stage at Meta Connect 2025, Zuckerberg was also seen scrolling through a user interface with swipes of his thumb, almost like flicking through pages of a book.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3120px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uNbz3i6S5ACdwfzna6hRvi" name="meta-connect-2025-show-meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-app-ui" alt="A screen capture of Mark Zuckerberg showing off Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses' app UI at Meta Connect 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uNbz3i6S5ACdwfzna6hRvi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3120" height="1755" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Holding your palm up and pinching your thumb and index fingers together brings up a "home" menu with an app launcher, similar to a smartphone or smartwatch.

With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify/spotify-lossless-listening-premium-subscribers-hear-every-refined-note-launch">Spotify finally making the move</a> to provide higher quality (maybe) streaming music with its new Lossless Listening feature, it's time to figure out if you should even care.</p><p>Lossless audio is technically a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/does-my-phone-have-dac-explaining-dacs-and-amps-smartphones-today">digital compression</a> method that reproduces the original analog sound perfectly. With the right equipment, it can be converted back to analog (speakers need this) and be an exact reproduction of the original.</p><p>Normally, you need to compress audio files so they aren't too large to stream. An uncompressed WAV file can be huge, even bigger than a video file. Lossless formats compress audio and programmatically toss out unnecessary information while keeping everything needed to recreate the original.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QTAdWzpFLPd4kgpSxRwfZG" name="Bose-QC-Ultra-Gen2-Earbuds-7" alt="The Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2 earbuds in their case beside a phone with the Bose app open." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QTAdWzpFLPd4kgpSxRwfZG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On the more practical side, lossless audio is a type of compression that provides enough information so that a human can't detect a difference from the original, but it's compressed and not identical. If it's compressing information, it's no longer an exact copy. But the term works and fits.</p><p>You might have been listening to the "practical" version of lossless audio all your life and never even knew it. CD quality is a type of lossless audio. The files are differentiated by their bitrate, and a CD-quality file is 16-bit/44.1kHz (a bitrate of 16 and a sample rate of 44.1kHz). Other popular lossless formats are 24-bit/48kHz or 96kHz, and even 32-bit with as high as 128kHz for a sample rate.</p><p>Confused yet? Don't be. This is cool to know if you're into this kind of thing, but <strong>in layman's terms, lossless audio is music that should sound better and more like the original recording </strong>than a lossy file like those MP3 files you downloaded from Napster back in the day. That's what you need to know if you don't care about how any of it works.</p><h2 id="do-you-need-this-in-your-life-2">Do you need this in your life?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="P8BAR62VhBhdsZFqbU8vmL" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-with-wired-sony-headphones" alt="Holding a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra while wearing a pair of wired Sony headphones" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P8BAR62VhBhdsZFqbU8vmL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I hate to say it, but <em>maybe</em>. If you can tell the difference when listening and using the phone and headphones you like, then yes, you totally should want this. Enough to pay extra by signing up for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-music-unlimited-vs-spotify-premium">Spotify Premium</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-music-vs-apple-music">Apple Music</a>?

When it comes to Bluetooth, everything turns into a big maybe again. Since almost everyone uses Bluetooth headphones or earbuds, that is the real deciding factor.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fDvmiXpduwyevLydwAcw85" name="snapdragon-sound-logo.jpg" alt="Snapdragon Sound" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fDvmiXpduwyevLydwAcw85.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It all comes down to file size and bandwidth.

According to Qualcomm, the new codec can stream at about 1.2 Mbps to deliver CD-quality 16-bit/44.1kHz audio.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/qualcomm-aptx">aptX Adaptive</a> codec has a maximum bitrate of 420kbps.

For reference, a CD audio file is 1,411kbps, so Qualcomm's "lossless" codec is close enough that almost nobody will ever be able to detect a difference.</p><p>Now, is your device supported? <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/these-9-earbuds-support-high-res-codecs">Are your headphones</a>? The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-sound">Snapdragon sound</a> platform is supported on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/snapdragon-8-gen-1">Snapdragon 8 Gen 1</a> or newer and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/qualcomm-s5-and-s3-audio-platforms-announced">S3 audio chip</a> or newer, so it very well could, and the technical specs of your device can give you the answer. However, it may still not work with your supported phone and headphones, in which case, there are still workarounds and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/spotify-lossless-audio-requires-this-gear-to-work">accessories you can buy</a> to take advantage of Spotify Lossless.</p><p>This is a perfect scenario, and any sort of interference can make all the difference. Bluetooth is like that. The solution and recommendation from companies like Spotify is to use wired headphones.</p><p>So the answer is still <em>maybe</em>. If you can hear the difference and it just doesn't work for you, try it with cheap wired headphones and a cheap USB-C audio adapter. Is <em>that</em> worth it to you?</p> ]]></dc:content>

It's a follow-up to the Headphone 1, and seems to take a few cues from its over-ear sibling. The Nothing Ear 3 now features longer battery life, a tweaked sound, spec bumps, and a redesigned case.

Nothing Ear 3 costs $179 in the U.S., and is also available in the U.K. and Europe for £179 and €179, respectively. This is a slight increase in cost compared to the $149 Nothing Ear 2.</p><p>You can buy the earbuds in black or white colorways, both of which feature a transparent design and an aluminum and plastic case. Nothing Ear 3 will be generally available as of Sept. 25 on Nothing’s official website and retail partners.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-nothing-ear-3-what-s-good"><span>Nothing Ear 3: What's good</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Vzh52FZXSAYmdA2c2SkNNb" name="Nothing-Ear-3-Review-8" alt="The Nothing Ear 3 in a white and silver aluminum colorway." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Vzh52FZXSAYmdA2c2SkNNb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Related Reviews</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nothing-ear-1-review"><strong>Nothing Ear 1 review</strong></a></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/nothing-ear-2-review"><strong>Nothing Ear 2 review</strong></a></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/nothing-ear-review"><strong>Nothing Ear review</strong></a></p></div></div><p>Nothing kept the hardware consistent between Ear 1 and Ear 2 in terms of audio delivery, but that's overhauled with Ear 3. There's a new, larger pair of 12mm drivers that upgrades the sound in Ear 3. Nothing says these dynamic drivers feature a PMI dome with a thick TPU surround to add deeper bass, and I believe it. The Ear 3 fully buy into Nothing's recent sound signature, like what we saw on Headphone 1.</p><p>Whether you love this sound or think it could be better probably depends on your taste. It's not really balanced, regardless of what Nothing claims, and instead prioritizes the bass and lower frequencies more than mids and highs. Like with Headphone 1, I found vocals and high-end sounds a bit muddied and underwhelming on the stock "Balanced" EQ preset. Also like with Headphone 1, I found that switching the Ear 3's EQ preset to "Treble" nearly fixed all my qualms with the sound.</p><p>The good news is that the Nothing X app is very good, and there's a robust EQ built-in that you can use to customize the Ear 3 to your liking.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="E4iK4HUmfASs4XxAFzXQ24" name="Nothing-Ear-3-Review-3" alt="The Nothing Ear 3 in a white and silver aluminum colorway." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/E4iK4HUmfASs4XxAFzXQ24.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While prior editions of Nothing Ear products lacked wider support for high-res audio transmission, that’s finally changing on the Ear 3. There’s still no AptX support, but LDHC 5.0 is gone in favor of LDAC support. This is the right move — while LDHC 5.0 is great if your phone supports it, not every Android model does. Notably, Samsung doesn’t support LDHC but does offer LDAC, so hi-res audio will now work on way more Android phones thanks to this welcomed Ear 3 change.</p><p>That’s just one part of the Ear 3’s connectivity upgrades. Bluetooth 5.3 is swapped for 5.4, and there’s a low-latency mode that cuts the wireless audio delay down to under 120ms. This will come in handy for gaming, and matches competing features from OnePlus and Samsung. Ear 3 also supports Google Fast Pair and Microsoft Swift Pair for near-instant connection with Android and Windows devices.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kfQZUeYbqfbgvzzBWVQEZb" name="Nothing-Ear-3-Review-10" alt="The Nothing Ear 3 in a white and silver aluminum colorway." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kfQZUeYbqfbgvzzBWVQEZb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Battery life was another drawback that came with using Nothing Ear 1 and 2, however, Ear 3 significantly improves the situation. You get up to 5.5 hours of listening time out of each earbud, and that’s with the Adaptive ANC mode turned on. The charging case, which supports wireless charging and USB-C, brings the total to 22 hours. There is one battery life “catch” that we’ll get to later.</p><p>Nothing’s big bet with Ear 3 has nothing to do with the earbuds themselves. It added a dual-microphone system to the Ear 3 charging case, and the brand calls it “Super Mic.” There’s a TALK button on the case that, when pressed, switches the audio input from the earbuds themselves to the case. It’s designed for calls and voice memos, and you can use it for longer sessions by double-pressing the TALK key.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BsoEoXVsPdpmw2tdjuyNu" name="Nothing-Ear-3-Review-6" alt="The Nothing Ear 3 in a white and silver aluminum colorway." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BsoEoXVsPdpmw2tdjuyNu.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Surprisingly, I think there’s a demand for this. It’s not uncommon to see people use wired earbuds or headsets because wired mic quality is just so much better than what we get from wireless earbuds. Nothing Ear 3 flips that notion on its head by adding a mic system to the case that’s better than what you’d get on wireless earbuds or your phone.</p><p>Switching between the Ear 3 mics and Super Mic on calls, people I talked to immediately noticed the difference, picking up on the extra loudness and crispness of my voice, as well as the separation between my voice and loud environments. As someone who owns the DJI Mic 3 — the pinnacle of wireless lavaliere microphones — and <em>never</em> uses it because I don’t have it with me when I need it, the Ear 3’s Super Mic is shockingly appealing to me.</p><p>Super Mic isn’t the only change to the Nothing Ear 3 case — it’s also partially made out of aluminum. That adds a premium feel to Ear products that can end up feeling cheaper with only plastic materials. The entire package is IP54-rated against dust, sweat, and water ingress, and the company says the aluminum case helps protect the Super Mic hardware inside. I personally think the silver aluminum case is stunning on the white variant.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="794ZZtV5gQeWxwwLJd4W83" name="Nothing-Ear-3-Review-5" alt="The Nothing Ear 3 in a white and silver aluminum colorway." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/794ZZtV5gQeWxwwLJd4W83.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are some exclusives you get when pairing Ear 3 with a Nothing phone, and they’re pretty neat. You can save voice recordings to Essential Space merely by pressing TALK and, well, talking. It’s also possible to trigger ChatGPT by double-pinching Ear 3 for quick AI questions. For people without a Nothing phone, that gesture will activate Gemini, Siri, or your preferred voice assistant.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-nothing-ear-3-what-s-not-good"><span>Nothing Ear 3: What's not good</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xeyZuLwYpBhrbZQHzxZ2ta" name="Nothing-Ear-3-Review-7" alt="The Nothing Ear 3 in a white and silver aluminum colorway." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xeyZuLwYpBhrbZQHzxZ2ta.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Buyer's guides</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds"><strong>Best wireless earbuds</strong></a></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones"><strong>Best wireless headphones</strong></a></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/best-wireless-earbuds-for-noise-cancellation-2025"><strong>Best ANC earbuds</strong></a></p></div></div><p>I may be picky, but I wasn’t impressed by the ANC quality on the Nothing Ear 3. The ventilation isn’t as good as I would like, creating unwanted pressure and discomfort in some situations with ANC enabled. Nothing says its real-time adaptive ANC can cancel up to 45dB of sound, which is about the same as Ear 2.</p><p>Transparency mode was the dealbreaker for me, as I depend on this feature for two main tasks: ordering and talking on the phone. I need to be able to tell a flight attendant what I’d like to drink without taking out my earbuds, and hear my voice clearly while on the phone to keep my volume in check. The Nothing Ear 3 struggled to pass these tests, weirdly amplifying background voices while seeming to block out my own — likely because transparency mode wasn’t strong enough to overcome the passive noise canceling from the earbuds.</p><p>I still think you can justify buying Ear 3 if you don’t care about ANC features or use them often, and battery life jumps up to 10 hours in that case. But if ANC and transparency modes are must-haves, there are better options at this price point.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ntUt2f6PS92DhxMhLjcqzb" name="Nothing-Ear-3-Review-11" alt="Nothing Ear 1 (left) beside Ear 2 (middle) and Ear 3 (right)." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ntUt2f6PS92DhxMhLjcqzb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Nothing Ear 1 (left) beside Ear 2 (middle) and Ear 3 (right). </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I mentioned that battery life is finally improved, and it is. But if you want to use LDAC with ANC at the same time, battery life is cut to just 3.5 hours on each bud. On some devices, you’ll need to enable LDAC in the Nothing X app, restart the buds, and then also enable LDAC in your phone’s settings app — a complicated process for those who want hi-res audio.</p><p>Speaking of limitations, I wish Super Mic worked with native Android or iOS video recording. Using the default camera app, a phone will always use its own mics for videos instead. This is a bummer, though it can be rectified by using third-party video recording apps like Blackmagic.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-nothing-ear-3-competition"><span>Nothing Ear 3: Competition</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hYp6w4jLG6GqS5pwMqgiX3" name="Nothing-Ear-3-Review-2" alt="Nothing Ear 1 (left) beside Ear 2 (middle) and Ear 3 (right)." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hYp6w4jLG6GqS5pwMqgiX3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Nothing Ear 1 (left) beside Ear 2 (middle) and Ear 3 (right). </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The case for the Nothing Ear 3 starts to get dicey when you consider the competition it’ll face at the $180 price point. It’s not a major price increase compared to Ear 2, but the price hike means Ear 3 will face “Pro” earbuds. The AirPods Pro 2, Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro, and Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 are all fairly easy to find under $200 if you’re patient enough, as there are near-constant deals on them. I’d take all three of those pairs over the Ear 3, simply because they each sound fuller, richer, and have better ANC.</p><p>For what it’s worth, the Ear 3 could eventually see discounts of its own to level the playing field. For now, Nothing’s decision to shift the price from $150 to $180 ends up putting the Ear 3 in the same realm as the upper echelon of truly-wireless earbuds.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-nothing-ear-3-should-you-buy-them"><span>Nothing Ear 3: Should you buy them?</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jYphpVXK5CNDW8uCXuL2pa" name="Nothing-Ear-3-Review-9" alt="The Nothing Ear 3 in a white and silver aluminum colorway." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jYphpVXK5CNDW8uCXuL2pa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>You should buy these if...</strong></p><ul><li>You have a Nothing phone or love the brand's design ethos</li><li>You like Nothing's signature, bass-heavy sound</li><li>You don't depend on strong ANC or transparency mode</li></ul><p><strong>You shouldn't buy these if...</strong></p><ul><li>You have Ear 1 or Ear 2 and aren't compelled by the upgrades</li><li>Outstanding ANC and transparency modes are must-have features</li><li>You don't want to spent time tuning the Ear 3 via the app's EQ</li></ul><p>Nothing overhauled the Ear 3, bringing new solutions to old problems — and creating some new ones.

That said, combine the two, and we're right back where we started.</p><p>Still, the Nothing Ear 3 are a delightful pair of wireless earbuds overall that aren't afraid to take risks.

It gives users more control over how they'd like to customize their home screen and you can select from a variety of different icon styles that match you preference,  you can even turn your apps into tiny flower blobs or cookies.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1154px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:60.14%;"><img id="seEQHbRTSS2JgoXuuykuD8" name="Android-16-QPR2-Beta-2" alt="Android 16 QPR2 Beta 2 is here" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/seEQHbRTSS2JgoXuuykuD8.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1154" height="694" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another feature that's customer facing is for the fitness enthusiasts, this beta introduces upgrades to Health Connect on the device. It gives used the ability to seamlessly track their steps using the device's sensors and Google notes that this feature won't cause your battery to drain as much.  Furthermore, the data types for exercises have also been expanded to include information metrics such as weight, set index, and Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE), which allows users to effectively track their workout progression.</p><p>On the developer's side of thing, Google is tightening up security, by introducing developer verification, which will become a requirement for app installation in certain regions starting in September 2026. This makes app installation on Android much more safer by preventing the spread of malware and scams, considering the tech giant had to delete several apps earlier this year as they were impacted by a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-mass-app-deletion-underway-confirmed">widespread Ad scam</a>. And ever since the company has been ramping up efforts to keep the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play-store/google-play-store-is-losing-apps">app ecosystem safe.</a></p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="EanvkdzoHDSkmWMHY55N2V" name="Google-Pixel-10-Android-16-7" alt="Pixel 10 and Galaxy S25 Plus Quick Settings editor" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EanvkdzoHDSkmWMHY55N2V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Speaking of security, this update also enhances SMS OTP protection for the users by preventing OTP hijacking by delaying the delivery of messages containing an SMS retriever hash for three hours for most apps. This means that if a malicious app is waiting to "catch" the OTP, it won't receive it immediately.</p><p>The beta is available for devices from Pixel 6 to the latest Pixel 10 series, and also includes the Pixel Tablet and Pixel Fold. Beta users will be able to download this via an over-the-air update on their devices.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="2f023cba-a427-4acc-a3cb-4ea46978cd63">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/roHfB8CwZvHJScuZ8TL6Bf.jpg' alt="Google Pixel 10"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 10</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>A new standard</strong></em></p><p>The Pixel 10 is one of the smartest phones you can buy thanks to the Tensor G5 chip and new Gemini AI features like Camera Coach and Magic Cue.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

The company's on-device description of the feature states this AI will answer questions "about your activity, sleep, nutrition, stress, or energy score." This AI assistant, which is reportedly running off Samsung's Galaxy AI software, will let users chat with it. The company's early test states its Health Assistant will leverage your "chat history" and "health trends" to answer your questions.</p><p>As the publication notes, Samsung's Health Assistant lends itself toward personalization, using your specific statistics and data to answer questions that fit your recent sleep and wellness trends.</p><p>The Health Assistant is also reportedly positioned as more of a "guide" rather than a tool to provide a diagnosis for a person's health. In a test chat, the AI responded to the publication's questions about ways to improve their sleep, which it responded with ways to calm their "sleep environment" every night. Additionally, the AI even offered upper-body workout ideas for building more muscle.</p><p>For now, there's no telling when Samsung could roll this out in its Galaxy AI chats.</p><h2 id="using-ai-virtual-assistance-2">Using AI & Virtual Assistance</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:277px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:216.61%;"><img id="i7mPpv7BK49r6k4ruzd2KD" name="samsung-health-assistant-splash-screen-test" alt="A screenshot of Samsung's Health Assistant test, informing users that they can ask the AI about their "activity, sleep, nutrition" and more for personalized answers." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/i7mPpv7BK49r6k4ruzd2KD.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="277" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: SammyGuru)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:275px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:218.18%;"><img id="cUJ7JVynSa8RRP8GPajQJD" name="samsung-health-assistant-chat-intro-test" alt="A screenshot of the Samsung Health Assistant chat test, which lets users ask the AI about ways to improve their health using their specific data and trends." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cUJ7JVynSa8RRP8GPajQJD.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="275" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: SammyGuru)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Samsung's placing its health assistance at the forefront of its devices, as a recent update for the app <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-health-enhances-care">brought virtual doctor visits</a>.

The setting, captured on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-hands-on">Pixel 9a</a>, shows a toggleable option for Call Recording, Manage Recordings, and Automatic Call Recording options. For the latter, the user notes the ability to have their Pixel automatically "record calls with non-contacts," or they can write in which numbers they'd like their device to record.</p><p>The "manage" side is simply a way for users to delete stored recordings or have their Pixel do it for them.</p><p>Google provides a little explainer about Call Recording, which states the feature will activate when on a call (if it's enabled). The company states your recorded calls will remain on your device, and it reiterates the user's ability to enable or disable the feature at any time. The interesting thing about this is that Google Pixel phones have previously lacked a Call Recording feature, which the publication points out.</p><p>However, it also picked up on an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/phoneapp/answer/9803950?hl=en">updated Google support page</a> about Call Recording, which now fully details steps for "Always Record," "start a recording," and more. It looks like Google is truly starting to move toward a Call Recording future for its Pixel phones, but only for Pixel 6 and newer phones running Android 9 or higher.</p><h2 id="is-it-truly-on-the-way-2">Is it truly on the way?</h2><blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelUsersIndia/comments/1ni9gt5/finally_call_recording">Finally call recording</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelUsersIndia">r/PixelUsersIndia</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><p>Unfortunately, the user on Reddit seems to be the only one who's received this Call Recording feature on their Pixel. It is strangely appearing on the Pixel 9a first, which one would think Google would drop this on their Pixel 10 series first. Regardless, if Google is actually bringing this to users more consistently, maybe we'll have a more concrete announcement for it. Right now, Pixel 8a and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a> users on Reddit running Phone app v191.0.805002009 (public beta) don't see it.</p><p>It's been a while, but we were talking about Call Recording on Pixel devices five years ago, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/here-what-law-says-about-recording-phone-calls">there were some serious issues</a> Google ran into. The legality is the feature was called into question, as government and State laws were brought forward. These State laws, such as "All Party" and "One Party" States, require citizens to abide by a different set of rules. For the former, both parties on the call must recognize and be okay with the call being recorded. However, a one-party state only requires one person to know the call's going on record.</p><p>Of course, one of the ways users could keep tabs on a call and its contents <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixels-call-notes-recording-disclaimer-could-be-going-away-soon">is with Call Notes</a>. A recent APK teardown reports that Google could remove its audio disclaimer that the call is being recorded to help users remain a little stealthy. It seems that, instead of a vocal disclaimer, Call Notes could play a soft chime to let users know the call's being recorded.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Almost as exciting is the barrage of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">Android handhelds</a> that have been announced over the past month, all slated to arrive starting next month. Not to be left out in the cold, we've been learning more about the Anbernic RG476H over the past few weeks, and now, we know the final details.</p><p>When the RG Slide was introduced, Anbernic also introduced a custom 4.7-inch LTPS display sporting a 1280x960 resolution and 120Hz refresh rate. Since then, the same screen has appeared in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/anbernic-rg477m-takes-a-metal-approach-to-gaming-handhelds">RG477M</a> and is also being used in the RG476H.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:768px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:133.33%;"><img id="w8pkTft6RoBAb8KSiTza5J" name="anbernic-rg476h-pricing-reveal" alt="Anbernic RG476H Pre-order discount details" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/w8pkTft6RoBAb8KSiTza5J.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="768" height="1024" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Anbernic)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While AYANEO and AYN are battling it out with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/the-ayaneo-pocket-ds-is-the-worlds-first-dual-screen-android-handheld">clamshell designs</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/ayn-announces-dual-screen-thor-and-next-gen-odin-3-handhelds">Snapdragon 8 Elite chips</a>, Anbernic took a different route, opting to go with the Unisoc T820 for the RG476H. That's a step below the RG477M, which is powered by the Dimensity 8300, but for good reason. Whereas the RG477M retails for around $280, the RG476H comes in at $165, with pre-orders <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://anbernic.com/products/rg476h">dropping that down to $150</a> for the first three days.</p><p>No, the RG476H won't win you any performance awards, but it still offers a great gaming experience, provided that you understand the limitations. This isn't Anbernic's first rodeo with the T820, as it also powered the RG556, RG406V, and RG406H from last year, and is also found in the RG Slide from earlier this year.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/87sLIS5vvTs" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>What that means in terms of emulation is that you'll be able to play a lot of the respective PS2 and GameCube libraries. However, you might run into issues playing some games that either require a bit of tinkering around, or just won't work at all. You can even squeeze a bit of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-cant-believe-it-theres-actually-a-switch-emulator-on-the-play-store">Switch emulation</a> out the T820, provided that you're playing games that aren't very graphics intensive.</p><p>In addition to the 4.7-inch, 120Hz display and the Unisoc T820, the rest of the Anbernic RG476H specs can be found below:</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1504px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RsfRwrAnes8Ztqn49vpS5J" name="anbernic-rg476h-features-bento-render" alt="Some features of the Anbernic RG476H" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RsfRwrAnes8Ztqn49vpS5J.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1504" height="846" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Anbernic)</span></figcaption></figure><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol empty" ></th><th  ><p>Anbernic RG476H</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>4.7-inch LTPS, 1280 x 960, 120Hz</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Unisoc T820</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>8GB LPDDR4X</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>128GB UFS 2.2 + microSD (up to 2TB)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>5,000mAh (~6 hours)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5.0</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Extras</p></td><td  ><p>Anbernic AI, Hall Effect Joysticks w/ RGB, USB-C DisplayPort Out, Active Cooling</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Considering that pre-orders for the KONKR Pocket FIT and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayn-odin-3-is-the-first-snapdragon-8-elite-handheld-starting-at-just-usd299">AYN Odin 3</a> are still available, giving you a Snapdragon 8 Elite for under $300, Anbernic had to tread carefully.

I also started <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Retractable-Charger-MacBook-AirPods/dp/B0DXDT9SKW">using retractable cables</a> on my desk, and they're much more convenient when it comes to managing cable clutter. I have designated cables for each task; I use 240W cables at my two charging stations, and have those with power meters attached to various power banks and chargers.</p><p>I also have dedicated cables to charge all of my smartwatches, and I end up taking around a half-dozen cables while traveling. That brings me to the point of this post; Indian accessory brand UltraProlink just rolled out a new cable that has USB-C, Lightning, and Apple Watch puck baked in. The cable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.in/ULTRAPROLINK-charging-Connector-Wireless-Macbooks/dp/B0F88F1VHR">costs ₹1,699 in India</a>, which is decent enough when you consider the trio of connectors available.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="JGfFRhVQQvd5hSQhGaMiaR" name="UltraProlink iLink Trio" alt="UltraProlink iLink Trio cable" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JGfFRhVQQvd5hSQhGaMiaR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The cable is called iLink Trio, and it has a standard USB-C connector at one end. The other side has the trio of connectors, and they're labeled; the USB-C port handles USB PD up to 60W, making it a decent enough charging cable on the go. The Lightning cable is good to use with older iPhones, and the Apple Watch charger is ideally suited for my needs.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="ECb2VAfPMfiZrEa5akEcWR" name="UltraProlink iLink Trio" alt="UltraProlink iLink Trio cable" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ECb2VAfPMfiZrEa5akEcWR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I tested the cable with the 500W UGREEN Nexode charging station, connecting it to my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/with-the-pixel-10-pro-xl-google-finally-made-a-faultless-flagship">Pixel 10 Pro XL</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>, and other USB-C devices.

In the example above, someone asked Meta AI to "make a stylized desert terrain," then followed by adding mountains with rocks, surrounding foliage, and, finally, a "desert city" that ties everything together.</p><p>While you'll still need to do things in steps like this to create a world, Meta says, "we’re not far off from being able to create compelling 3D  content as easily as you can ask Meta AI a question today." In other words, Meta hopes to make AI an integral part of your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/virtual-reality-a-complete-guide-to-vr-headsets-vr-glasses-and-more">virtual reality</a> experience.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:640px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="czi7pJmmEhNZiZ8nubLUqZ" name="gordon-ramsay-home-meta-hyperscape" alt="An animation showing Meta's Hyperscape tech mapping Gordon Ramsay's home into a photorealistic virtual environment" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/czi7pJmmEhNZiZ8nubLUqZ.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="640" height="360" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We're also seeing major changes and upgrades to the Horizon Worlds ecosystem on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/meta-quest">Meta Quest</a> headsets. The "immersive home" environment that appears when you power on your Meta Quest headset is now linked directly to Horizon Worlds via the Horizon Central environment. You can immediately jump into popular worlds and easily converse with other users, plus pin apps and other windows to the walls in the environment, and even watch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/meta-beats-android-xr-makes-instagram-scrolling-spatial">3D content on Instagram</a>.</p><p>All of this is powered by the new Meta Horizon Engine, which Meta says has been "built from scratch and optimized to help bring the  metaverse to life." Meta says that graphics are not only better than ever, but things load 4x faster, and 5x as many people can be in one world at a time. That'll make social environments feel a lot more <em>social</em> and less like being in a limited game environment.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bzMTejqie5gYUDVrBz9FMe" name="meta-horizon-tv-app-home-official-screenshot" alt="An official screenshot of the 2025 Meta Horizon TV App update" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bzMTejqie5gYUDVrBz9FMe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Horizon Central allowed users wearing Quest headsets to watch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/live/meta-connect-2025-live-blog">Meta Connect 2025</a> live alongside other players, and it's clear this vision of live events and interconnection is what Meta is pushing as the future of VR social spaces. Meta maintains <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest-2/2532035600194083/events/">a list of Horizon Worlds events</a> that includes concerts at Red Rocks, big names like Sabrina Carpenter, late-night comedy shows, and much more.</p><p>Meta also notes that photorealistic worlds are launching soon, powered by the company's Hyperscape engine, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/meta-horizon-hyperscape-demo/7972066712871980/">you can try on Meta Quest headsets for free right now</a>. Hyperscape Capture also launches in early access today, letting you use your Meta Quest headset to scan your room and turn it into a photorealistic world your friends can visit.</p><p>Lastly, Meta is launching Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN on the Horizon TV app, which is already preinstalled on your Meta Quest headset. It's becoming the new center for streaming media, simplifying things by removing the need to install additional apps. It's a bit like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv">Google TV</a> interface, so it feels immediately familiar and easy to use. Plus, Meta just launched an exclusive 3D clip of Avatar: Fire and Ash on the Horizon TV app, which you should definitely check out if you've got a Quest headset.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses are totally changing the game for tech eyewear, letting you do pretty much anything while keeping your phone tucked away; from checking messages to basically navigating through life, you get to do it all with just one glance at the in-lens display.</p><p>Meta's new smartglasses feature a high-resolution, full-color display, integrated with microphones, speakers, and a camera, all designed to work seamlessly with Meta's AI.</p><p>As for the glasses' design, Meta says it wanted to create something that looks both stylish and is extremely functional, making them "look and feel great."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kJ5kQgXutT2r9L9XHkhWD3" name="meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-official-lifestyle-with-gesture-band-03" alt="An official lifestyle shot of someone wearing Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kJ5kQgXutT2r9L9XHkhWD3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Weighing only 69 grams, these smartglasses look a lot like Ray-Ban's Wayfarer with a distinct square outline, with slightly rounded edges, making them look more aesthetic.</p><p>At the front, the lens gets a slight curve, which is said to help reduce glare from screens and other sources of light. As for the over-extension hinges, they are made using titanium, ensuring both durability against wear and tear and a lightweight design.</p><p>The smartglasses are powered by a first-of-their-kind ultra-narrow steelcan batteries that are smoothly embedded in the glasses' thin temple arms, giving them extended battery life.</p><h2 id="the-magic-of-display-2">The magic of 'Display'</h2><div><blockquote><p>This isn't about strapping a phone to your face. It's about helping you quickly accomplish some of your everyday tasks without breaking your flow.</p><p>Meta</p></blockquote></div><p>These Ray-Ban glasses feature a tiny, high-resolution monocular display that's been put into the frame. The display's custom-built light engine provides sharp, bright visuals with 42 pixels per degree of view—a density not found in any other smartglasses to date.</p><p>According to Meta, these lenses are photochromatic, meaning they adjust automatically based on the light you're in. For privacy, the in-lens display has minimal light leakage (just 2%), and a capture LED that lets people know when the camera is recording, so that they aren't caught off guard.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GdRiG33v2ANhCApnn9TGKk" name="meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-official-lifestyle-display-messaging" alt="An official image of Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses' display showing text messaging" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GdRiG33v2ANhCApnn9TGKk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That said, you wouldn't want to be bumping into things or people while looking at texts or the map, so Meta has placed the display off to the side so it won't block your view. "This isn't about strapping a phone to your face. It's about helping you quickly accomplish some of your everyday tasks without breaking your flow," the press release added.</p><p>What's exciting is that these glasses come with an EMG Meta Neural Band, with an 18-hour battery life and an IPX7 water rating. It is made to detect muscle movements and hand gestures made by the user. This basically replaces the need for you to reach for your glasses, and lets you control it with a sensor on your wrist, so users can "scroll, click, and, in the near future, even write out messages using subtle finger movements," the blog adds.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DhhjPYtpeL9Ew65UivowJn" name="meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-official-render-neural-band" alt="An official product render of Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses' neural gesture band fabric texture" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DhhjPYtpeL9Ew65UivowJn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="here-s-comes-meta-ai-2">Here's comes Meta AI </h2><p>Meta's AI is basically what makes these glasses so unique. According to the company, users will be leveraging its multimodality, meaning it can show you answers and step-by-step how-tos, like having a conversation with someone. Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses can help with messages and video calling, from WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger. It lets you control your camera shots better with the ability to zoom and preview them before you click.</p><p>These smartglasses are said to provide "phone-free" turn-by-turn navigation with walking directions, along with Live translation and captions during conversations. According to AC's Senior Editor Michael Hicks, it cuts out the noise of other people's conversations, so you only get captions for the folks you're actually looking at.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4NSfiFEdgymW9EkVKzMkSk" name="meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-official-lifestyle-display-recipe-tomato" alt="An official image of Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses' display showing a Meta AI prompt about a tomato recipe" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4NSfiFEdgymW9EkVKzMkSk.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="a38SZoLvnDfpFWCi4BVsRk" name="meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-official-lifestyle-display-navigation" alt="An official image of Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses' display showing turn-by-turn navigation" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a38SZoLvnDfpFWCi4BVsRk.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5Gj8LUwDDu3Va7pikJSANk" name="meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-official-lifestyle-display-live-captions" alt="An official image of Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses' display showing live captions" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5Gj8LUwDDu3Va7pikJSANk.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Starting at $799, the Meta Ray-Ban Display (glasses and Meta Neural Band included) launches on September 30 at select US retailers (Best Buy, LensCrafters, Ray-Ban Stores, Verizon), with expansion to Canada, France, Italy, and the UK in early 2026.

Meta recommends interested people <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/demo/scheduler/">book a demo</a>.</p><p>The Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses launch at $799 in Shiny Black and Shiny Sand.

I had the chance to wear them while running on the treadmill on Meta's campus before Connect, and I could instantly tell they were exactly what I'd been looking for.</p><p>I've been trying to make the old Ray-Ban Metas work as a running companion for years; I even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/running-a-half-marathon-with-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses">wore Ray-Bans during a half-marathon</a> this year. But battery and hardware issues made them an imperfect companion — issues that the new Vanguard design seems to have resolved.</p><p>Oakley Meta Vanguard's redesigned fit and nine hours of battery life are vital upgrades for athletes. My last-gen Ray-Bans slide constantly down my face or bounce on my nose while running, while the Vanguards stayed secure during a treadmill sprint.</p><p>And where the last models can't be trusted to survive a long workout, this model gives you enough buffer room to survive a marathon with full streaming and occasional photos.</p><h2 id="fitness-ready-hardware-and-software-coming-together-2">Fitness-ready hardware and software coming together</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="J5XMQSo5SwxwUehZqHqiKE" name="Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-selfie" alt="A selfie of the author wearing the Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses at Meta Connect 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/J5XMQSo5SwxwUehZqHqiKE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Oakley Meta Vanguards are six decibels louder than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oakley-meta-hstn-smart-glasses-review">Oakley HSTNs</a>. In my demo, I appreciated the rich audio above the loud whirring of a treadmill and the chatter of demos around me, keeping the Meta AI responses audible.</p><p>But beyond the hardware, what most excited me was how Meta focused the software and intangibles to make Vanguard work well during runs (or any other sports).</p><p>Exhibit A: You can sync a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a> to your Vanguard glasses and hear your workout stats at any time, without having to look down at your watch and swipe through widgets.</p><p>Meta had me strap on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-forerunner-570-review">Garmin Forerunner 570</a> running watch and start walking on a treadmill. I asked, "Hey Meta, what's my current pace?" and "What's my heart rate?" and received prompt and timely answers, because of the Meta AI-Garmin Connect integration.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="JNzPdRyHKoSGPTgzcbKFeD" name="Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-with-Meta-AI-workout-summary" alt="Photo of the Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses sitting on a treadmill next to a phone showing a Meta AI workout summary." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JNzPdRyHKoSGPTgzcbKFeD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I switched to a hard run and was able to keep asking Meta AI questions about my form and speed while keeping my eyes facing forward. I appreciated that I could ask about any stat Garmin tracks, without worrying about swiping through watch menus to find it.</p><p>Meta's rep told me this feature only works with a few Garmin workout types, like Running and Walking, for now, but that they plan to expand it. He then explained that if you're following a Garmin course, you can program your glasses to auto-capture photos at mile markers or landmarks, which is a fascinating idea.</p><p>I'd love to see Meta expand its live workouts to more fitness brands in the future. For now, you can sync Meta AI with an Apple Watch or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android watch</a> with Health Connect, and see a personalized summary of how this activity compares to past efforts.</p><p>This isn't quite as exciting as hearing your stats mid-workout, but at least it's a free alternative to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/strava-interview-athlete-intelligence-inaccurate-gps-race-leaderboards-and-more">Strava AI</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-connect-plus-in-depth-hands-on-much-more-than-an-ai-unfortunately">Garmin Connect+</a> summaries.</p><h2 id="action-photos-just-got-even-easier-2">Action photos just got even easier</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="c35922bo7jz8iM5sZXpMED" name="Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-held-in-hand" alt="Photo of the Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses held in hand." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/c35922bo7jz8iM5sZXpMED.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="og6jAjbGG9npMjRpu3oteB" name="Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-side-view-logo" alt="Photo of the Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses from a side view showing the design and Oakley logo." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/og6jAjbGG9npMjRpu3oteB.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="P5jsrQT8PkTvEic94joEEE" name="Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-back-view" alt="Photo of the Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses from the back, showing the displays, nose guards, and Oakley Meta logo." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P5jsrQT8PkTvEic94joEEE.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Capturing candid, stabilized shots mid-workout is a specialty of Meta AI glasses, and I took a few 3K photos with Vanguard that came out clearly. They're the same quality as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oakley-meta-hstn-camera-review">current Oakley HSTN photos</a>, but I appreciate that the 122º wide-angle lens is centered now, so it's a little easier to judge what you're capturing.</p><p>What I'm even more excited about, though, is that Meta is introducing new shortcut commands you can say without the Meta AI preamble. Most notably, you can simply say "Photo" to trigger a capture, saving you time and making it more likely you'll capture a cool moment.</p><p>You still have the photo/video button, but Meta added a second configurable Action button next to it that you can use to trigger specific shortcuts, such as slow motion/ hyperlapse videos for capturing an epic extreme-sports moment, or controlling your music.</p><p>Best of all, the Vanguards have an IP67 rating — compared to IPX4 on the current models — that makes them much better suited to both extreme sports and everyday workouts, with no fear that rain or sweat will break something.</p><h2 id="who-are-they-for-besides-me-2">Who are they for?

But in that specific use case, they're truly exciting.</p><p>Wearing them at Meta Connect, I found them comfortable and securely fitted enough that I could see myself taking them out on every run, protecting my eyes and giving me the music and photos I need to stay in the zone.</p><p>They're certainly suited for extreme athletes, as the Red Bull sports demo on stage at Connect proved. But I think anyone who works out regularly will benefit, especially if they like to share their progress on social media or save memories from races.</p><p>Meta is launching the Oakley Meta Vanguard in Black with Prizm 24K and Road lenses, or in White with Black or Sapphire lenses. It will cost $499/ €549/ £499 in 17 countries in North America and Europe, and you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/ai-glasses/oakley-meta-vanguard-glasses/">preorder it now</a> before the October 21 launch.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Keeping that in mind, today (Sep 17), the Meta Connect 2025 event announced the return of its most popular lenses, the Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2)—better and stronger than before. Meta states that it hasn't changed much from what you remember about the Gen 2 lenses; however, it has shifted to make noteworthy improvements that you'll surely notice.</p><p>Under that modern exterior, the Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) boasts a huge upgrade to its cameras. The ultrawide 12MP camera consumers are familiar with can now record videos at 3K Ultra HD. Meta states its AI glasses can reach heights of 60fps with this recording quality/resolution.</p><p>Regarding its video capabilities, the press release states the enhanced Gen 2 glases can record 3K video at 30fps for up to three minutes. Specifications also mention 1440p at 30fps recording for up to three minutes, and 1200p recording at 60fps for up to three minutes, as well.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AeXD3FyAYYdRDcM76tKXyX" name="ray-ban-meta-gen-2-official-lifestyle-01" alt="An official lifestyle photo of a person wearing Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AeXD3FyAYYdRDcM76tKXyX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The upgrades continue for the second-generation lenses, as Meta also details an enhanced battery life. These Gen 2 glasses can last up to eight hours with "typical use" and, when you need to charge, they can reach 50% in roughly 20 minutes. The on-the-go charging case gives consumers up to 48 hours of additional battery time for whenever you're running low.</p><p>While these features are what will pique interest in Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 consumers, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/live/meta-connect-2025-live-blog">Meta Connect 2025</a> announcements didn't stop there. "Later this fall," Meta says it plans to update its hands-free filming capabilities, bringing hyperlapse and slow motion options to users. These two filming options are headed for "all of our AI glasses." So, expect these on lenses beyond just the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2.</p><p>More than that, Meta's AI glasses are also looking at a new conversational update called "Conversation Focus." The brand's AI glasses will attempt to "amplify" the person's voice that you're speaking with to give it some separation from all the background noise. This will arrive as a software update for Ray-Ban Meta and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oakley-meta-hstn-smart-glasses-review">Oakley Meta HSTN</a> glasses.</p><p>Live translation capabilities on its AI glasses support German and Portuguese as of today (Sep 17).</p><h2 id="ray-ban-meta-enhance-2">Ray-Ban Meta, Enhance!</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Nt9kVcVSbQEg3skttFXABY" name="ray-ban-meta-gen-2-official-lifestyle-05" alt="An official lifestyle photo of 2 people wearing Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Nt9kVcVSbQEg3skttFXABY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What's a Ray-Ban Meta glasses announcement without styles?

The remote offers hands-free voice commands with Alexa, making it easy to control playback, volume, and even smart home devices through the unit.</p><p>The Fire TV Stick 4K comes with 8GB of onboard storage for apps and 2GB of RAM, which is just as much as the other premium options, but more than Amazon's HD model.</p><p>It utilizes Wi-Fi 6, and it offers cloud gaming via Amazon Luna and Xbox Game Pass. It's also compatible with Dolby Atmos audio, and includes video features such as Dolby Vision and the latest versions of HDR.</p><p>Overall, it's definitely best saved for those who actually have a 4K TV, but if you do fall into that category, $30 should come as a tempting offer at which to access that level of high-res streaming.</p> ]]></dc:content>

I can't blame anyone, while not much was really said, a lot was implied in an attempt to build hype from a master of building hype. The plan worked exactly as intended.</p><p>There are a few "real" hints at Nothing's future in Pei's forum post. Nothing will have a new product this fall. Nothing was able to get a handful of companies that often make investments they know won't pan out to give him some money. Nothing has shipped "millions" of devices in four years. And Nothing knows it has to get on the AI train while it's the current trend. Pei hints that the company wants to do it a bit differently.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Nothing OS 4.0 Refined. Redefined. Coming soon. pic.twitter.com/496fufxV0f<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1965701874927210751">September 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>Pei never said he was building a new OS from the ground up, even if it sounds that way. He said, "<em>The next chapter for Nothing, integrating an AI experience into our hardware devices to reinvent how technology amplifies us,</em>" and to me, that can only mean one thing: Nothing is going to try its hand at building its own AI suite rather than partnering with another company. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Think Samsung</a>, not <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/the-motorola-razr-and-perplexity-are-trying-to-change-how-you-use-your-phone">Motorola</a>.</p><p>Regardless, Android Central has reached out to Nothing for clarification on its plans and what its "AI OS" is, and will update this article when we hear back.</p><h2 id="the-hard-truth-2">The hard truth</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="vx3szA693pWtxFHKPmofqP" name="rabbit-r1-vision.jpg" alt="Vision mode on the Rabbit R1" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vx3szA693pWtxFHKPmofqP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>But the truth is, and I'll be blunt, if devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-bought-into-the-ai-hype-and-all-i-got-was-an-orange-square">Rabbit R1</a> were what consumers wanted to buy, Apple and Samsung/Google would be making them. Even then, the Rabbit was just another Android presented in a way that didn't seem like an Android. Instead, Apple and Samsung are building AI into the OS one chunk at a time at a pace they can manage without breaking everything.</p><p>There's another truth to think about, especially when it comes to smartphones. You have two options <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/huaweis-android-replacement-os-will-start-rolling-out-june">outside of China</a>: Android or the graveyard where good things go once they have died. Look for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/facepalm">webOS</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/do-you-wish-windows-phone-still-existed">Windows Phone</a> logos on the tombstones to know you've found it. People do not want something that doesn't offer at least as much as what they are used to having. When it comes to a phone, that means a million apps and the infrastructure to keep adding more features.</p><p>Pei and every other CEO in the mobile business know this. I don't know what Nothing's AI OS will be like, but I know it will likely be based on Android, with access to the Google suite of mobile services and the Play Store. What I'm hoping to see are products that "talk" and "learn" from each other.</p><h2 id="the-vision-2">The vision</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8MsFtAuSCJMHPvqVyYTVpQ" name="Nothing-phone-2a-with-phone-1-and-phone-2.jpg" alt="Holding the Nothing Phone (2a) with Nothing Phone (1) and Nothing Phone (2) in the background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8MsFtAuSCJMHPvqVyYTVpQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Imagine having a Nothing AI OS account and using it for several devices like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/heres-what-i-want-from-nothing-phone-3-after-using-phone-3a-pro">your phone</a>, your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/nothing-ear-open-review">headphones</a>, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">tablet</a>, or anything "smart." What you do on one device can affect what happens on the others without you making any decisions if they are tied together well. It could need to be incredibly intrusive when it comes to your privacy, but whoever does it the right way first will be ahead of the game once everyone else figures it out.</p><p>I think this is what Nothing is shooting for: an Android-powered OS on every device it sells, from smartphones to smart glasses, with AI and smarts baked in so that it all works together. It's the same thing Samsung, Google, Apple, Xiaomi, and everyone else are working towards. Nothing is small enough, maneuverable enough, and bold enough to go for it where other companies must be more cautious.</p><p>Nothing isn't likely to make the next Rabbit R1 or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/humane-announces-its-departure-from-the-ai-scene-hp-acquires-it-for-usd116-million">Humane AI Pin</a>, and probably has no plans to try it. Nothing wants to make the next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a> in a way that works better with the Pixel 10 version of a watch or earbuds. Smart devices being smarter together would be the next breakthrough we keep hearing about.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It also fixed the issue with the power button not working in certain instances when connected to Android Auto and charging via USB-C, along with issues with the keyboard not responding in certain conditions.</p><p>That said, no other Pixel phones got this update that seems to be showing up automatically for Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro users in Settings, and users will typically get a notification when the update is ready.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="0d88eb15-1fe9-422f-9ce1-73da0f352bac">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/roHfB8CwZvHJScuZ8TL6Bf.jpg' alt="Google Pixel 10"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 10</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Save money and still get the best of Google, Gemini, and the famous Pixel camera, now with a triple-camera system on the back for epic zoom.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

While most user-facing changes shipped earlier with Android 16 QPR1, including the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-unveils-the-most-massive-android-redesign-ever">Material 3 Expressive design</a>, Android 16 QPR2 is set to bring two major UI changes: forced dark mode and auto-themed app icons.</p><p>Forced dark mode, as the name suggests, will implement dark mode in apps that don't support it natively. On the other hand, auto-themed app icons have existed in Android for some time, but Google hasn't forced developers to make their icons compatible. This has resulted in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-make-material-you-adaptive-icon-pack-icon-pack-studio">poor user experience</a>, with some icons supporting Material You theming while others look out of place.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-qpr2-beta-1-is-here">Android 16 QPR2</a> will aim to fix this by forcing all app icons to adopt the system's theme. Google says the new icon theming engine applies a color-filtering algorithm that renders app icons in a monochrome style, making them consistent with the chosen theme.</p><p>Google is now formally notifying developers as well. As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-play-icon-theming-agreement-3597899/">Android Authority</a>, starting October 15 for existing developers, revisions to Google Play's Developer Distribution Agreement (DDA) section 5.3 will take effect, stating that users will be allowed "permission to modify colors or adjust themes of apps.".</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2650px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:54.34%;"><img id="ohUceg9WKbmmSAvU7SUE8D" name="google-play-rule-change" alt="Google Play rule changes" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ohUceg9WKbmmSAvU7SUE8D.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2650" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With this change, Google aims to help both users and developers avoid potential conflicts, such as issues with modifying a brand's icon. For new developers, the rules already went into effect on September 15, 2025.</p><p>This change also seems necessary for Google to protect itself from takedown notices from brands and developers. Still, it's great to see Google finally taking steps to improve icon theming on Android.</p><p>Apple did something similar with iOS 18, but even though Google implemented universal icon theming earlier, it's only now being properly and fully enforced.</p> ]]></dc:content>

So if you switch from treadmill running to stair stepping to jump roping at the gym, you can incorporate all three into one exported activity.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8192px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2WXustBPFucpSfKJWfVtKS" name="Garmin-Venu-4-yoga" alt="A photo of the Garmin Venu 4 on a woman's wrist as she does a yoga pose on a mat." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2WXustBPFucpSfKJWfVtKS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8192" height="4608" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Venu 4 also receives features previously restricted on its predecessor, such as following downloaded GPX courses, training load and effect, lactate threshold, performance condition, and other perks you'd find on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-forerunner-570-review">Forerunner 570</a>.

Its main competitors at the time were the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-vs-samsung-galaxy-s24">Samsung Galaxy S24</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-vs-google-pixel-8-pro">Google Pixel 8 Pro</a>, and it gave those devices a run for their money by utilizing the powerful Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor and one of the best 120Hz AMOLED displays we had ever seen up to that point. </p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="RhhcQ4N6zLajzntorQmw7F" name="oneplus-12-4.jpg" alt="OnePlus 12 camera module against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RhhcQ4N6zLajzntorQmw7F.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As described in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">our 4.5/5-star review</a>, the OnePlus 12 also boasts some fantastic camera tech and a two-day battery straight out of the box, while the 100W wired/50W wireless charging means that you can juice the phone up quick when it does start to run low on battery life. Pair that with a luxurious, eye-catching design and you're looking at an all-around fabulous Android experience.</p><p>Needless to say, this year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> is a better phone in just about every way, but perfection comes at a price.

Just be aware that the OnePlus 12 doesn't have IP68 ingress protection, and you'll only get four more years of OS upgrades.</p><p>OnePlus phones can also have some issues with US carriers, so be sure to check with your phone company before you commit. If you want a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">cheap Android phone</a> with long software support or fancy AI tricks, you might be better off looking at some midrange models from Samsung or Google.</p><h2 id="october-prime-day-quick-links-2">October Prime Day - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Amazon:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals">discounted headphones, Amazon tablets, and more</a></li><li><strong>Best Buy:</strong> <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals">up to $250 off Chromebooks, tablets</a></li><li><strong>Walmart:</strong> <a href="https://www.walmart.com/shop/savings/electronics">major savings on Chromebooks, smart TVs</a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/">foldable phones, trade-in opportunities</a></li><li><strong>Lenovo: </strong><a href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/d/deals/doorbusters/">epic laptop sale, free shipping for students</a></li><li><strong>Dell:</strong> <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/deals">students get 10% off all back-to-school purchases</a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

And you get sapphire glass instead of basic "chemically strengthened" protection, along with the new flashlight and upgraded GPS accuracy.</p><p>“From a day on the hiking trail to a night on the town, Instinct Crossover AMOLED offers the best of both worlds," says Garmin VP Susan Lyman.</p><p>The Instinct Crossover AMOLED offers a more classic style than the Instinct 3, with a steel bezel instead of aluminum and vibrant hands that are easy to see in any environment. Garmin promises that its RevoDrive tech will "detect and recalibrate misaligned hands" so you always know the correct time; it's something they offered in the original Crossover.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="sDnabtyTWtk38E8g7XqAs9" name="Garmin-Instinct-Crossover-AMOLED-night-photo" alt="A photo of the Garmin Instinct Crossover AMOLED watch on a person's arm at night." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sDnabtyTWtk38E8g7XqAs9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p>According to the specs sheet, the Instinct Crossover AMOLED weighs 67g with 15mm thickness, slightly heavier than the Instinct 3 but with a similar bulky design.</p><p>Garmin is launching the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/1800201/">Instinct Crossover AMOLED at $649</a> in two colorways: charcoal and bronze/ sunburst.

This new feature is all about making it easier and more affordable for women to really understand how their lifestyle choices impact their cycle.</p><p>This partnership aims at syncing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-review">Ultrahuman Ring AIR </a>with Clue, which allows users to automatically import up to six months of their cycle history from Clue directly into the Ultrahuman app, instead of switching between two apps to look for their health data.</p><p>The company says that the combined real-time data from Ultrahuman such as skin temperature, resting heart rate, and heart rate variability, along with cycle tracking information from Clue will allow users to see how their menstrual cycle phases correlate with their activity levels, sleep patterns, giving them a clear picture as to how different factors impact their cycle and if they need to take action to improve health.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:7680px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RGwc3XauVdb6Te4yVztBU7" name="Ultrahuman-air-clue-collab" alt="Ultrahuman partners with Clue to give woman better cycle tracking insights" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RGwc3XauVdb6Te4yVztBU7.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="7680" height="4320" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ultrahuman)</span></figcaption></figure><p>"This combined view provides women with a broader picture of their health, bringing together cycle patterns and daily biomarkers in one place," Ultrahuman stated in its press release. This only makes it easier for women to notice connections between, let's say, sleep patterns and how their period is either on time or delayed, reflect on health goals, and adapt routines in ways that feel aligned with their bodies.</p><p>As for how this works, the ring tracks the body's biomarkers and tracks how the body also reacts differently during various cycle phases—such as the follicular and luteal phases—which can affect energy levels, mood, and resilience. For example, a user might see how their skin temperature and resting heart rate increase during the luteal phase, which can help them correlate these and make changes to their routines if needed.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:7680px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oMbFcnXZmgNNjUqpxompe6" name="Ultrahuman-air-clue-collab" alt="Ultrahuman partners with Clue to give woman better cycle tracking insights" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oMbFcnXZmgNNjUqpxompe6.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="7680" height="4320" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ultrahuman)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Furthermore, users will also be able to record the intensity of cramps and mood swings with the Clue Plus subscription, and see how they connect with Ultrahuman Ring's recovery and temperature insights. This kind of tracking is helpful for women of all ages, whether they're trying to track their period, fertility, get pregnancy insights, or perimenopause guidance.</p><p>Lastly, every purchase of the Ultrahuman Ring AIR now includes a full year of Clue Plus for $9.99 – reduced from $39.99. This subscription also provides extended 12-month forecasting and expert-backed guidance from clinicians to help users better understand their bodies. And for those who already own an Ultrahuman Ring Air, the company says it is working to get you access to Clue Plus at a special price in the near future.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="3311906c-1cb2-4380-8f0e-f5e825a485bd">            <a href="https://www.ultrahuman.com/ring/buy/us/" data-model-name="Ultrahuman Ring Air" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jWmpt8LYymbGiqxuSRfTcZ.jpg' alt="Close-up render of the Aster Black Ultrahuman Ring Air"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Ultrahuman Ring Air</div>                                <div class="stars__reviews"><span itemprop="reviewRating" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Rating" class="chunk rating"><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star half"></span><meta itemprop="bestRating" content="100.0" /><meta itemprop="worstRating" content="0.0" /><meta itemprop="ratingValue" content="70" /></span></div>                </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Blending in</strong></em></p><p>Do you dislike the feeling of something on your wrist while sleeping?

I had UniFi cameras previously, and while I like what Ubiquiti does with its products, lack of integration with Google Home and Home Assistant was a deal-breaker. That's why I went with Nest; I wanted cameras that would be easy-to-use and tied in with Google Home.</p><p>While it was annoying to buy Nest Aware just to be able to access footage from my cameras, I did so because of the convenience, even when Google hiked the price to $80 a year in 2023. But with another round of hikes — with the plan now going up to $100 — I decided to move to another platform.</p><p>I needed three things: strong focus on privacy, local access, and an easy way to power the devices. I had to rule out Eufy and most other Chinese brands because of previous vulnerabilities or lack of transparency, and finally landed on Reolink. I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/this-is-the-only-local-storage-security-camera-i-trust-and-its-at-an-all-time-low-right-now">tested the Argus 4</a> in the past, but my unit had issues with battery life — more so than the Nest Cam Outdoor — so I wasn't able to use it outdoors.</p><p>Given that I didn't want to deal with the hassle of charging the security cameras, I wanted a model that was powered by PoE or wall outlet. Thankfully, Reolink's Elite Floodlight fit my needs ideally; the camera has 180-degree coverage thanks to two lenses, and as the name suggests, it has built-in lighting to illuminate its surroundings at night.</p><p>It comes with local storage via a MicroSD slot, and there's no monthly or annual fee. Best of all, I was able to integrate it easily into my network video recorder, giving me the ability to view the camera feed from anywhere. I used the Elite Floodlight for just over three months now, and it has been nothing short of excellent.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="YoKbLqw6suGEtPCQXFKX7a" name="Reolink Argus" alt="Reolink Argus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YoKbLqw6suGEtPCQXFKX7a.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Image quality is clean and detailed, and the camera does a great job stitching footage from the dual lenses. I didn't see any issues with low-light footage either, and the built-in floodlight gets incredibly bright (going up to 3000 lumen) at its highest setting.</p><p>It has good connectivity over Wi-Fi 6, and I didn't see any issues in this regard. By contrast, I had problems connecting to my Nest Cam Outdoor, and it would regularly glitch out when I pulled up the feed to view who's at the door. There are no such issues with the Elite Floodlight, and its motion detection along with zone intrusion alerts combined with local storage give it a definite edge.</p><p>I have the Elite Floodlight mounted outside the front door, and its IP66 ingress protection has proven to be reliable in India's monsoon weather. Setting it up was straightforward, and Reolink's mobile app is good in its own right. Best of all, as it delivers an RTSP stream, it's easy to link the camera to an NVR without any hassle.</p><p>In addition to the Elite Floodlight, I've been using the Atlas, a battery camera with a 2K lens and Wi-Fi 6 connectivity. The Atlas comes with a solar panel, alleviating the need to dismount it and charge the device. The Atlas misses out on RTSP, so I have it set up in a balcony that doesn't get much use.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="67WnGnEpa8bN3nCsuCYQ5a" name="Reolink Argus" alt="Reolink Argus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/67WnGnEpa8bN3nCsuCYQ5a.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Reolink also has a cloud-based tier that lets you store footage, but given that its cameras have built-in MicroSD slots, I didn't see the point of leveraging the feature. While I generally don't like using MicroSD storage, it has been decent enough in the three months I used the Elite Floodlight and Atlas, and I didn't run into any issues. If you are interested in saving footage in the cloud, Reolink uses the industry-standard AES encryption when data is in transit.</p><p>The biggest reason I switched to Reolink cameras is the ease of access; it would take anywhere between five to 10 seconds to load the footage after pulling up the feed on my Nest cameras, and it's considerably faster on the Elite Floodlight and Atlas. I can view the feed within a few seconds. With the footage going out to my NVR, I'm able to store 24/7 recording for as long as I need (I set it to 90-day intervals).</p><p>Another positive with Reolink is the affordability. The Atlas c<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/REOLINK-Altas-Solar-Pre-Record-Subscription/dp/B0F1YGLF7S">osts $135 as of writing</a>, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/REOLINK-Elite-Floodlight-WiFi-Adjustable/dp/B0DWSJVXJH">Elite Floodlight available for $197 on Amazon</a>. Considering there's no fee to access footage, that's a pretty great value when you consider the rest of the feature-set.</p><p>With these cameras set up, I'm looking to get my hands on additional Reolink cameras; the brand makes PoE products as well, and that's what I'm interested in picking up next. Overall, Reolink has proven to be the ideal alternative to Nest, and the flexibility combined with the feature-set makes the brand my go-to recommendation.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="76caa940-cdac-4798-b127-1a2f3476cfa0">            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/REOLINK-Altas-Solar-Pre-Record-Subscription/dp/B0F1YGLF7S" data-model-name="Reolink Atlas" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:87.45%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9pSfaZD6Wn59G4HcPk6d9A.jpg' alt="Reolink Atlas"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Reolink Atlas</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The Atlas is a great starting point if you need a new camera; it has good coverage, the 2K lens delivers clean imagery, and it doesn't cost much. </p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="00c198c0-abec-43f0-9395-1d7407579a8d">            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/REOLINK-Elite-Floodlight-WiFi-Adjustable/dp/B0DWSJVXJH" data-model-name="Reolink Elite Floodlight " ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:67.93%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/efN88bMijTgaExX4VgovLU.jpg' alt="Reolink Elite Floodlight "></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Reolink Elite Floodlight </div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The Elite Floodlight is my go-to choice if you need a camera with built-in illumination.

Officially called the "Google Rope Wristlet," the store listing says, "Secure your phone with a burst of fun and let the good times (and good looks) roll." Essentially, this wrist strap is designed to keep your phone secured around your wrist when walking around and even when using it.</p><p>Think of it as a safety net so you don't drop it when you're walking around.</p><p>The Rope Wristlet is 9”(L) x 3”(W) and is made from polyester. When purchased off the Google Store, the company states consumers will receive a box with the wrist strap, the phone insert, and the carabiner ring. From Google's brief look, the wrist strap will attach to your Google Pixel's USB-C port cutout area.</p><p>The publication assumes this strap will work with any case, so long as that port cutout is present.

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Enjoy our content? Make sure to <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should">set Android Central as a preferred source</a> in Google Search so you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>Pixels always had slower storage modules, with the Pixel 9 series coming with UFS 3.1 across the board when every other high-end phone included UFS 4.0. Thankfully, Google is finally changing its stance this year on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a>, with all models getting UFS 4.0 — provided you get the 256GB storage variant.</p><p>Interestingly, the Pro models get Zoned UFS (ZUFS) 4.0, a variant of UFS 4.0 that stores data more efficiently. Essentially, data on a ZUFS 4.0 module is catalogued and stored in distinct zones, and this leads to faster loading times and increased efficiency over the lifetime of the storage module.</p><p>With Google guaranteeing seven Android OS updates, going with ZUFS 4.0 is obviously the right move in ensuring the storage module doesn't degrade. There's just one problem; ZUFS isn't standard on all models. In fact, the 128GB model of the Pixel 10 Pro still uses the older UFS 3.1 storage, and it's annoying that Google isn't providing UFS 4.0 on all of its models. Even if you get the 256GB model, it comes with UFS 4.0 and not ZUFS, with that limited to the 512GB and 1TB models in the U.S.</p><p>Annoyingly, Google doesn't provide ZUFS in the 512GB model of the Pixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL in the U.K. and other global markets — you'll need to get the 1TB model if you want the storage module. It would be nice if Google standardized access across its range — like every other phone manufacturer — but that clearly isn't the case. In countries like India, where Google only sells the 256GB model of the Pixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL, there's no way to upgrade to the ZUFS model.</p><p>I don't have a 512GB Pixel 10 Pro, so I'm unable to test its efficacy against the 256GB UFS 4.0 model, but I tested my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/with-the-pixel-10-pro-xl-google-finally-made-a-faultless-flagship">Pixel 10 Pro XL</a> against other phones that have UFS 4.0 storage, and found it to be on the lower end of the scale when it comes to sequential reads and writes. If anything, there's not a huge difference between the Pixel 10 Pro XL and last year's UFS 3.1-based Pixel 9 Pro XL, and it's likely Google is focusing on efficiency instead of raw numbers.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4879px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="pvCA5GuuD5a85GCPGUyAs9" name="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL photos on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pvCA5GuuD5a85GCPGUyAs9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4879" height="2748" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This is the case with the Tensor G5 as well, so it stands to reason that the storage situation is in line with Google's priorities instead of the industry standard. Even if there isn't a huge upgrade, moving to UFS 4.0 and ZUFS 4.0 puts the Pixel 10 and 10 Pro models in line with their immediate rivals, and while you may not see a tangible difference right now, it should be evident a few years down the line.</p><p>Should you buy the 512GB model of the Pixel 10 Pro just because of ZUFS 4.0? No. Get it if you need additional storage, and you see yourself taking a lot of photos and videos. Google is pushing users toward Google One plans as a way to manage excess storage, and I'm not a fan of using cloud storage — I'd like to be able to store all of my photos and videos on-device.</p><p>ZUFS 4.0 is just one of the ways Google is addressing long-standing issues with its devices, and combined with better cameras, more durable design, brighter OLED panels, and unique software features, the Pixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL are proving to be among the best phones around.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="7bd45214-8cdc-4a87-bdd5-18be1a68b1cf">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PxxDbVJ9FVx2Wvfu4QSSU3.jpg' alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro in Jade"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 10 Pro</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The Pixel 10 Pro has all the features you need; the cameras are even better, and it excels at zoom, going all the way up to 100x.

The company is on schedule to spend $70 billion on AI investments in 2025 alone, but its decade-long investment of around the same amount into AR/VR research is the one about to pay off big time.</p><p>I'm talking, of course, about the upcoming launch of several new Ray-Ban and Oakley-branded smart glasses scheduled to be announced at Meta Connect 2025 on September 17 at 5 p.m. PT. Central to that is a new paradigm for smart glasses, seemingly called Ray-Ban Meta Display, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-gesture-input-spotted-early-in-alleged-promo-video">based on a new leak</a>. These glasses offer a true next-generation upgrade over existing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Smart glasses</a>, but Meta isn't stopping there.</p><p>The company is also expected to announce a new line of Optical and Sunglasses Ray-Bans complete with Meta technology inside, in addition to an even sportier pair of Oakley smart glasses in the company's trademark Sphaera visor form factor. The company is seemingly going all-in on glasses from EssilorLuxottica brands, and it's just the beginning of what we're going to see from the partnership when they're likely to be unveiled at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/live/meta-connect-2025-live-blog">Meta Connect 2025</a> this week.</p><h2 id="brand-power-2">Brand power</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3120px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="PUapEJURywSxDXFcxfDrX6" name="oakley-meta-ray-ban-meta-connect-2025-leak" alt="The entire lineup of new Oakley and Ray-Ban Meta Smart glasses as seen in a leaked, unlisted promotional video on Meta's YouTube channel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PUapEJURywSxDXFcxfDrX6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3120" height="1756" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Screenshots from a leaked promotional Meta YouTube video)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Just this week, Amazon announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-fire-tablet/new-devices-and-ai-upgrades-on-the-horizon-at-amazons-annual-fall-event">a new hardware event</a> at which they're expected to announce their own pair of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/amazon/amazons-ar-glasses-rival-to-ray-ban-meta-wont-work-unless-it-changes-tactics">next-generation Echo Frames</a>. These smart glasses are supposed to be a major upgrade on older audio-only Echo Frames, said to offer similar functionality to Ray-Ban Display glasses, including cameras and a display embedded in at least one of the lenses.</p><p>But the kicker is that they're rumored to cost $800, the same price tag as Ray-Ban Display glasses. Even assuming Amazon somehow packs more power and technology in their frames for the same price, I'm not sure I can see most consumers choosing Amazon-branded glasses over Ray-Bans, especially for that price.</p><p>This perfectly illustrates the place Meta has now found itself after years of promising investors that a proper return on their money is right around the corner. Miniaturizing technology enough to make an attractive pair of glasses has been an incredibly difficult venture, but it's clear Meta has impressed EssilorLuxottica enough to make an even more powerful pair, and I expect customers will also be impressed.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3120px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.09%;"><img id="mCeHrMN2nqj5ib9jvKXCmC" name="ray-ban-meta-display-leak-maps" alt="Ray-Ban Meta Display smart glasses leaked turn-by-turn navigation feature on its lens-embedded display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mCeHrMN2nqj5ib9jvKXCmC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3120" height="1750" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Screenshot from a leaked Meta YouTube video)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Seeing this trend in action, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-can-make-smart-glasses-accessible-with-warby-parker-gentle-monster-deals">is taking the same steps</a> to make smart glasses for popular eyewear brands. The company announced a partnership with Warby Parker and Gentle Monster earlier this summer. As someone who only started wearing glasses two years ago, I had never heard of these brands before Google's announcement, but I have certainly heard of Oakley and Ray-Ban since my childhood days.</p><p>Meta seems to have scooped up the right ones with universal appeal, and further rumor has it that the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/metas-ray-ban-smart-glasses-are-a-hit-and-its-now-planning-a-massive-production-ramp-up">will be targeting Prada wearers next</a>, potentially with an even more expensive price tag to match the brand's pedigree.</p><p>The Devil might wear Prada, but so do all the other people with a ton of money, and Meta's position as the stylistic smart glasses brand will cement its legacy in a way I don't even think Mark Zuckerberg could have dreamed up just a few years ago.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The company teases that the Xiaomi 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max are equipped with its new "magic back screen" (machine-translated). The teaser opens with the phone on the horizon, showing off its rounded corners and flat sides.</p><p>After flipping over, we're presented with its large external display on its back panel, which houses two camera lenses, though one is rumored to sit under that, too.</p><p>Xiaomi's video illuminates the "magic back screen," giving us a few examples of future uses. It seems the Chinese OEM intends for the display to be used as a clock, perhaps for music, photography, and more. The end of the clip flashes the "Xiaomi 17 Pro" name, further confirming that the Pro and Pro Max will feature this external display, not just a camera array on its back.</p><p>Xiaomi states, officially, that it intends to launch the 17 series "this month" in September.</p><h2 id="from-leaks-to-confirmation-2">From leaks to confirmation</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">BREAKING！Let’s take a look at the new design of the Xiaomi 17 series, the most anticipated flagship phone at the end of the year. pic.twitter.com/sgXeAhzq9h<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1967791790662226142">September 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>We just wrapped up a round of Xiaomi 17 series leaks yesterday (Sep 15), as a tipster on Weibo spotted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi/leaked-xiaomi-17-pro-render-huge-external-screen">the company's profile icon change</a>. Xiaomi changed its profile to a model from the upcoming 17 series, proudly showing off its external display. The screen back there resembles what you'd find on a foldable device, especially as it fully encompasses its cameras, like a clamshell phone.</p><p>A statement by Xiaomi's head, Lu Weibing, was also highlighted yesterday, as a post by them on Weibo confirmed the new series will rock the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-confirms-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</a>. Moreover, we're expecting three devices: a Xiaomi 17, 17 Pro, and 17 Pro Max. What's funny is that this external screen idea on a slab phone is something Xiaomi tried years ago with the Mi 11 Ultra.</p><p>That device sported an external screen, though it was quite tiny and vertical on the right side of its horizontal camera housing. Now, in 2025, it seems Xiaomi is leveraging some of that foldable tech for a display that's much larger and more immersive, capable of displaying elements from across its mobile OS. Following Xiaomi's assumed September launch confirmation, we have roughly two weeks before the 17 series launches, ideally.</p> ]]></dc:content>

That's exactly what I'm suggesting you do if you're in the market for a new tablet, because Samsung's Galaxy Tab S10 FE offers much of the same experience, but is currently on sale <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Processor-Note-Taking-Manufacturer-Warranty/dp/B0DVZSRJ8Q?th=1"><strong>for just $429</strong></a>.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-fe-and-s10-fe-plus-launched">Tab S10 FE</a> normally retails for about $500, so this deal saves you $80, and it's available from Amazon, Best Buy, and even Samsung directly. Speaking of Samsung, if you already have a tablet and want to upgrade, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/tablets/galaxy-tab-s10-fe/buy/galaxy-tab-s10-fe-blue-128gb-sku-sm-x520nlbaxar/">save up to $350 with trade-in</a>, knocking the price of the Tab S10 FE down to just $149.</p><p>The Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ and the ancient Tab S7+ are both worth the most, maxing out the trade-in deal. But as long as you have a tablet that isn't broken and still holds a charge, you can trade it in and save $100. However, the trade-in doesn't stack with the current deal, so it's either one or the other.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="d2742f31-01eb-4e7a-b14a-f567b47ebc44" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 FE: $499" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 FE: $499" href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Processor-Note-Taking-Manufacturer-Warranty/dp/B0DVZSRJ8Q?th=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="Pvxmz8VoTfJXR6P6v7UE7M" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-fe-square-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Pvxmz8VoTfJXR6P6v7UE7M.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="800" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 FE: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Processor-Note-Taking-Manufacturer-Warranty/dp/B0DVZSRJ8Q?th=1" data-dimension112="d2742f31-01eb-4e7a-b14a-f567b47ebc44" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 FE: $499" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 FE: $499" data-dimension25=""><del>$499</del> <strong>$429 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>Just because it's not as new as the Tab S11, that doesn't mean you should just ignore the Galaxy Tab S10 FE. Not only is a fantastic tablet, at a fraction of the price, but that price is now even lower from pretty much all of your favorite retailers. </p><p><strong>Price comparison: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-fe-10-9-128gb-wi-fi-with-s-pen-gray/J3ZYGXC9QH/sku/6618942">Best Buy - $429</a> | <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/tablets/galaxy-tab-s10-fe/buy/galaxy-tab-s10-fe-blue-128gb-sku-sm-x520nlbaxar/">Samsung - $429</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you're in the market for a new tablet, know that you want a Samsung Galaxy Tab, but don't want to pay for the new Galaxy Tab S11.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you need the most powerful and premium tablet that Samsung offers, short of the Tab S11 Ultra. Or you're still holding onto your Galaxy Tab S9 and are ready to upgrade to the latest 11-inch model.</p><p>Samsung's Galaxy Tab FE lineup is far from being overly flashy, which also means that it doesn't come packed to the brim with features you won't use. Well, at least in the Gemini and Galaxy AI department, as some of those features require a bit more horsepower in order to provide a smooth experience.</p><p>That said, the Tab S10 FE is an excellent alternative to the Galaxy Tab S11, and not just because they're practically the same size. For one, there are still plenty of fun and useful features available on the Tab S10 FE, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>, and Handwriting Assist in the Samsung Notes app.</p><p>The latter of which pairs quite well with the Tab S10 FE, especially when you consider that Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/these-samsung-galaxy-tab-models-support-s-pen">includes an S Pen</a> in the box. It's not the fancy new hexagonal S Pen that just debuted with the Tab S11 series, but that's more of a design change than anything else.</p><p>Some other features of the Galaxy Tab S10 FE that might be noteworthy are the 90Hz display, IP68 water and dust rating, and the built-in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-micro-sd-card-android">microSD card slot</a>. Plus, the Tab S10 FE is rated for up to 20 hours of battery life, which is even longer than what the brand new Galaxy Tab S11 is rated for.</p><p>No matter what way you look at it, as long as you don't have a specific requirement for having the "best of the best," the Tab S10 FE is easily the "best of the rest."

The iPhone 17 Pro is the entry point to the Pro series, and it has the exact same features as the Pro Max model — just in a more compact size and with a smaller battery. On the Android side, the Pixel 10 Pro is its closest and direct competitor that happens to be priced roughly the same.</p><p>While it might seem like a slam dunk for the iPhone, the Pixel 10 Pro has its share of trump cards too; it should be able to pull off clearer telephoto images, the AI features are most definitely more alluring, and the larger battery capacity should allow it to last longer on a single charge.

It's not going to be an easy choice choosing either one, so let's break it down and see if we have a clear winner.</p><h2 id="iphone-17-pro-vs-google-pixel-10-pro-design-and-display-2">iPhone 17 Pro vs. Google Pixel 10 Pro: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2291px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="k24br4t5Pe6THQc8LrsKDe" name="iphone-17-pro-promo-render-from-announcement" alt="Render of the iPhone 17 Pro in all three colors from announcement" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/k24br4t5Pe6THQc8LrsKDe.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2291" height="1289" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>After multiple generations of the same design, the iPhone 17 Pro finally gets a new look. The most noticeable change is a wider camera bump on the back that Apple calls the "camera plateau." This raised portion creates more room inside for components, allowing for a larger battery. The result is a phone that's actually thicker and heavier than its predecessor. It's thicker than the Pixel 10 Pro as well, but lighter by one gram.</p><p>Apple has ditched titanium for the frame and gone back to aluminum with the iPhone 17 Pro. It's a unibody design for the first time, which Apple claims provides significantly better durability. The phone is IP68 rated, supports MagSafe charging, and you now get Ceramic Shield over the back panel as well. Another iPhone first is the use of a vapor chamber for more effective cooling.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review">Google Pixel 10 Pro</a> also uses a vapor chamber, just like most other Android flagships for the past decade. There's nothing worth writing about in terms of design, though, as it's nearly identical to the Pixel 9 Pro from 2024. The 10 Pro does get <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/google-pixelsnap-hands-on">Pixelsnap</a>, which lets it use Qi2/MagSafe wireless charging and accessories natively, just like the iPhone.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5712px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="M8qXLesHgH95i7QM5SMuED" name="Pixel-10-Pro-all-hues" alt="Pixel 10 Pro in all shades" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/M8qXLesHgH95i7QM5SMuED.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5712" height="3213" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>iPhones have always had impressive displays, and the iPhone 17 Pro is no exception. It's a 6.3-inch Super Retina XDR OLED with a 120Hz refresh rate and a peak brightness of up to 3,000 nits. Apple is using its new Ceramic Shield 2 coating over the display, which it says offers three times better scratch resistance than before. Thankfully, there's a lot less glass on the back of the iPhone 17 Pro due to the new design, which means the odds of cracking it when dropped are less.</p><p>The Google Pixel 10 Pro has the exact same screen size as the iPhone 17 Pro, with roughly the same resolution, too. This LTPO OLED panel also has a 120Hz refresh rate, but the peak brightness is higher at 3,300 nits. It's not the most eye-friendly display, though, due to its low PWM dimming rate, although Google has added an option to fix this in software. You get Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 for scratch resistance.</p><h2 id="iphone-17-pro-vs-google-pixel-10-pro-hardware-and-specs-2">iPhone 17 Pro vs. Google Pixel 10 Pro: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QbPm2me7qcxx2UGtwsmTP5" name="apple-iphone-17-pro-max-orange-display-toms-guide" alt="An orange Apple iPhone 17 Pro Max with its default neon wallpaper" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QbPm2me7qcxx2UGtwsmTP5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Toms Guide)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Apple silicon has always been a generation or two ahead of the best SoC in the Android realm, and that's not changed.

The image quality from the cameras is rather excellent overall, especially images shot via Portrait mode, which Google has finally fixed.</p><h2 id="iphone-17-pro-vs-google-pixel-10-pro-software-2">iPhone 17 Pro vs. Google Pixel 10 Pro: Software</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5009px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="NAbPcBeMTYdT2xqHJr9kFA" name="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL photos on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NAbPcBeMTYdT2xqHJr9kFA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5009" height="2821" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The iPhone 17 Pro runs iOS 26, which has gotten a big design overhaul in the form of Liquid Glass for its UI elements.

A lot of the AI processing for the new features on the Pixel 10 Pro now runs on-device, which means faster operation and better privacy. Android 16 isn't as big a visual overhaul as iOS 26 is, but the changes are meaningful and make using your Pixel even better.</p><p>AI performance is in the Pixel 10's favor, due to Google's more mature suite of features led by Gemini. Meanwhile, Apple is still catching up with its AI, and while it has some notable features, they generally don't compare to those found on the Pixel, and we're still waiting for the major Siri overhaul.</p><h2 id="iphone-17-pro-vs-google-pixel-10-pro-which-should-you-buy-2">iPhone 17 Pro vs. Google Pixel 10 Pro: Which should you buy?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jLq4jqYrHvT5BECMjFwxhm" name="iPhone-17-Pro-2" alt="The iPhone 17 Pro Max in press renders showing the unibody design and camera features." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jLq4jqYrHvT5BECMjFwxhm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This is never an easy answer, as you'll be choosing between two very different platforms, and many factors, such as your current accessories, wearables, and chargers, will need to be considered. I think the iPhone 17 Pro is a fantastic choice over the Pixel 10 Pro, even if you are a long-time Android user. Sure, Apple is trailing behind in the AI game, but apart from that, nearly everything else seems better. The more powerful chip, better video recording capabilities, eye-friendly display, faster charging, and compatibility with a ton more cases and accessories.</p><p>I'd choose the Pixel 10 Pro if AI features are the biggest draw for you. It comes close to the iPhone in overall specs, except in a few areas like gaming. Like the iPhone, it too will get day-one OS upgrades, and its current features will keep getting augmented thanks to Pixel Drop updates.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="f551b691-c82b-4c7d-b300-6baa3f43600a">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/egnTiinBmNpHDkPPfnMf5C.jpg' alt="The iPhone 17 Pro in Cosmic Orange in a white product render."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">iPhone 17 Pro</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The need for speed</strong></em></p><p>If you want raw power and excellent industrial design, the iPhone 17 Pro is the clear winner.

The phone was so <em>stupid</em> thin I was sure it wouldn't last a day on a single charge, much less be able to sustain top-end performance while playing games. To my astonishment, it passed both of those tests with flying colors, and this year's Magic V5 is <em>even thinner</em>.</p><p>If you can believe it, despite being even thinner than the previous year's phone, the Magic V5's battery is 13% larger. It seemingly makes no sense, especially given that the battery is 32% larger than the similarly thin Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7. While it might sound like voodoo magic, the secret comes from a place you might not have expected: electric cars.</p><p>Honor has been using these silicon-carbon batteries <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honors-silicon-battery-tech-makes-the-magic-7-pro-stand-out-even-more">for a few years now</a>, and each year they improve. This year, we got an even bigger bump than usual, and it's enabling phones to get thinner without compromising on important things like battery life and charging speed.</p><h2 id="from-cars-to-smartphones-2">From cars to smartphones</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="jqVfHDAsnVtYcnUZuzxPY9" name="honor-magic-v5-gold-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-blue-bottom-tent-02" alt="Comparing the gold Honor Magic V5's hardware with the blue Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jqVfHDAsnVtYcnUZuzxPY9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Group14 Technologies is the company behind the big push for more silicon in our batteries, and a lot of this push began with the need for more energy in electric cars. Cars, after all, require <em>a lot</em> more power to function than your average smartphone, so it was important to figure out how to get a larger capacity battery that <strong>also</strong> charges quickly into the same size form factor.</p><p>This is done by taking the traditional lithium battery material, graphite, and blending it with silicon in the anode part of the battery. Electric car anodes can have up to 30% silicon blended with graphite, while the Honor Magic V5 tops out at 15%, which is still the most we've seen in any smartphone to date.</p><p>Since silicon stores a lot more energy in the same space as graphite, manufacturers can create higher-capacity batteries that fit in the same space. In an ultra-thin phone like the Honor Magic V5, Galaxy Z Fold 7, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review">Galaxy S25 Edge</a>, or even the iPhone Air, a larger silicon-carbon battery can make your thin phone feel like magic. It's just too bad Samsung, Google, and Apple aren't using them at all.</p><h2 id="the-charging-test-2">The charging test</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="oYvcTZNBKQLrmrUEpKtwFg" name="honor-magic-v5-gold-silicon-carbon-battery-01" alt="The gold Honor Magic V5's battery indicator screen showing information on silicon-carbon battery tech" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oYvcTZNBKQLrmrUEpKtwFg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Earlier this summer, we learned about how regulations <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/phone-battery-transportation-rules-3574123/">could be</a> keeping battery sizes down. The gist is that shipping regulations cap a battery at 20Wh in capacity, which equates to roughly 5400mAh in the smartphone world. This restriction is partly why Chinese models typically have larger batteries than the global model of the same phone.</p><p>The Honor Magic V5 packs a 5,820mAh battery, while the Galaxy Z Fold 7 uses just a 4,400mAh battery. While this might sound like a problem for Honor initially, the trick is that this regulation is <em>per cell</em>, meaning companies have to use dual-cell batteries. The good news is that companies like OnePlus and Honor have been doing this for years.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Model</p></th><th  ><p>Battery size</p></th><th  ><p>Weight</p></th><th  ><p>Time to 100%</p></th><th  ><p>Average amount per minute</p></th><th  ><p>Peak temperature</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7</p></td><td  ><p>4400mAh</p></td><td  ><p>215g</p></td><td  ><p>1 hour 25 minutes</p></td><td  ><p>51.76mAh</p></td><td  ><p>33C ⭐</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Honor Magic V5</p></td><td  ><p>5820mAh ⭐</p></td><td  ><p>217g</p></td><td  ><p>50 minutes ⭐</p></td><td  ><p>116.4mAh ⭐</p></td><td  ><p>36C</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</p></td><td  ><p>5000mAh</p></td><td  ><p>218g</p></td><td  ><p>1 hour</p></td><td  ><p>83.33mAh</p></td><td  ><p>33C ⭐</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Google Pixel 10 Pro XL</p></td><td  ><p>5200mAh</p></td><td  ><p>232g</p></td><td  ><p>1 hour 35 minutes</p></td><td  ><p>54.75mAh</p></td><td  ><p>40C</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OnePlus 13</p></td><td  ><p>6000mAh ⭐</p></td><td  ><p>210g ⭐</p></td><td  ><p>35 mins ⭐</p></td><td  ><p>171.42mAh ⭐</p></td><td  ><p>32C ⭐</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Using a dual-cell battery also ensures faster charging rates since you can charge two cells in tandem.

Amazon will have to compete directly with Meta for its AR glasses to succeed, but it'll have to do better than its Echo Frames if it wants to compete.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/amazon-developing-ar-glasses-challenge-meta">The Information</a>, Amazon has two prototypes in production. "Jayhawk" will have "microphones, speakers, a camera, and a full-color display in one eye." For Amazon delivery drivers, "Amelia" will reportedly use dual screens to "help drivers sort and deliver packages."</p><p>Amazon's consumer AR glasses will allegedly arrive in "late 2026 or early 2027," with a current target "price point of about $800."</p><p>Amazon's hardware brand is all about value. It sells a $400 Echo Show 21 and Kindle Scribe — and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-astro-home-robot">$1,600 robot</a> — but most of its "premium" products top out around $200; it's built a reputation for cheap quality, and then uses that as a foundation to upsell people into the low-to-mid-range.</p><p>I understand why, logistically, Amazon would charge $800 for AR glasses, and why it's interested in joining the smart glasses race. But it's going to have an uphill battle to convince people to spend that much on Amazon Glasses, for three reasons.</p><h2 id="amazon-s-affordability-is-working-against-it-2">Amazon's affordability is working against it</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YqMupAMPmuyZyAUDv4VUuJ" name="echo-show-10-lifestyle-2.jpg" alt="Echo Show 10 Lifestyle 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YqMupAMPmuyZyAUDv4VUuJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jeramy Johnson / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Your typical Amazon <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-alexa-device">Echo speaker or display</a> costs anywhere from $50 to $200, and Amazon slashes its prices constantly, from Prime Day to holidays. It sets the standard that Alexa, itself, is a cheap, pedestrian at-home companion for weather forecasts and package notifications.</p><p>Will Amazon's typical deal-hunting customers spend $800 on glasses from a value brand? It's doubtful.</p><p>Allegedly, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-hypernova">Meta's Hypernova glasses</a> will cost $800, but reports say they <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/metas-next-gen-smart-glasses-could-land-next-month-for-less-cash-than-youd-think">originally cost hundreds more</a> before Meta lowered its profit margins to make them more appealing. Meta has built goodwill with its current $300 Ray-Ban AI glasses and $400 Oakleys, but it knows it can't raise the price too high without scaring people away.</p><p>Amazon can't prioritize a cheap price here, either: components for lightweight AR glasses with all-day battery life and a bright, high-res display are expensive! Anything less than $800 would produce a subpar design no one would wear; I'm happy Amazon knows not to try.</p><p>To inspire thrifty customers to spend smartphone-level money, Amazon must change people's perception of Amazon Glasses as being desirable, in a way it failed to do with Echo Frames.</p><h2 id="step-1-give-alexa-plus-a-makeover-or-publicity-push-2">Step 1: Give Alexa Plus a makeover or publicity push</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4QjE7GDAz7Ue44EoUbNrrH" name="Alexa-plus-logo" alt="Amazon Alexa Plus logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4QjE7GDAz7Ue44EoUbNrrH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1280" height="720" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Amazon)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Amazon launched <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/amazon-announces-alexa-plus">Alexa Plus</a> earlier this year with a Large Language Model (LLM)-powered intelligence and language boost, with AI "experts" on specialized topics similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>'s Gems. Alexa Plus communicates with other streaming apps and smart home tech, mirroring Gemini Extensions.</p><p>The problem is that Alexa remains shackled to your home, with limited input besides what you give it. Something like Gemini integrates more closely with other apps and is more natural to use anywhere on your phone.</p><p>Amazon obviously hopes to solve this with smart glasses; built-in cameras can offer multimodal AI insights, the same way Meta AI can analyze your surroundings, and the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-gen-3">Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 3)</a> will supposedly remember everything you see.</p><p>But again, Alexa's reputation for basic Googling and Amazon cart recommendations is working against them.</p><p>Amazon needs to convince people that Alexa+ smarts are insightful enough that you'll want to wear it all day. For that, Amazon must create tools like live translation and multimodal AI that will unshackle Alexa and make her suited to outdoor use. Then it'll need a major advertising blitz to let people know Alexa can keep up with its rivals.</p><h2 id="step-2-amazon-needs-a-design-partner-2">Step 2: Amazon needs a design partner</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1591px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="gA49nNS822vdTmiBHxxBBV" name="gentle-monster-warby-parker-partnerships-android-xr" alt="Android XR partners Gentle Monster and Warby Parker" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gA49nNS822vdTmiBHxxBBV.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1591" height="895" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Meta bought a 3% stake in EssilorLuxottica — which makes Ray-Ban and Oakley glasses — for about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/meta-takes-around-3-stake-ray-ban-parent-essilorluxottica-source-says-2025-07-08/">$3.5 billion</a>, part of a "symbolic" gesture to cement their smart glasses partnership.</p><p>It sells <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oakley-meta-hstn-smart-glasses-review">Oakley Meta</a> glasses, emphasizing the fashion brand before Meta's own name, because it knows that most people don't want to wear tech glasses, but rather fashionable glasses <em>with tech</em>.</p><p>Likewise, Google has invested <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://investors.warbyparker.com/news/news-details/2025/Warby-Parker-Partners-with-Google-To-Develop-Intelligent-Eyewear/default.aspx">$150 million</a> in Warby Parker's "product development and commercialization," as part of their partnership to make <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR glasses</a> using WP designs.

By sitting parallel to the phone’s body, they deliver 3x to 10x optical zoom, a big leap from older digital zoom approaches.</p><p>Even with recent progress, smartphone zoom still has a big drawback. Current phone zoom is stuck at fixed steps, like 2x or 10x, forcing digital zoom to fill the gaps and degrading quality.</p><p>Samsung’s continuous zoom system fixes this by physically moving the lenses to deliver smooth optical-quality zoom across a full range, just like a standalone camera.</p><p>The upcoming continuous zoom camera from the Korean tech giant is set to phase out older telephoto and periscope sensors in future phones, keeping images sharp even at higher zoom levels on upcoming flagship models.</p><p>Technically, continuous zoom works by dividing a telephoto module’s lenses into several groups and shifting them precisely to adjust focal length, creating smooth, uninterrupted magnification.</p><p>Hopefully, Samsung brings this tech to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">own flagships</a> soon, as it’d be a huge leap forward for smartphone photography.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The feature, fine-tuned over a two-year test phase, is built to help them tap into a bigger global audience. The full rollout should wrap up in the next few weeks.</p><p>The feature relies on Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini AI</a> in order to recreate the creator’s voice and emotions for translations that feel genuine.</p><h2 id="how-it-works-2">How it works</h2><p>Creators have two dubbing options: manual or automatic. With manual dubbing, they can upload their own voiceovers or bring in professional talent. Automatic dubbing, on the other hand, uses machine translation and synthetic voices to create new audio tracks. It’s turned on by default for eligible channels, but creators can opt out or review the AI-generated dubs before they go live.</p><p>At the moment, automatic dubbing translates English videos into Japanese, Hindi, Spanish, and Korean, with more languages on the way. But YouTube warns the AI may miss subtle tones, idioms, or proper names. Creators who need precise, expressive translations might still prefer manual voiceovers or pro dubbing services.</p><h2 id="how-to-manage-it-2">How to manage it</h2><p>To handle your multi-language dubs, you’ll need YouTube Studio on desktop. In Settings > Upload defaults > Advanced settings, you can toggle <em>Allow automatic dubbing</em> for all future uploads.</p><p>If you’d rather approve dubs first, turn on <em>Manually review dubs before publishing </em>— you can review every track or just the experimental languages.</p><p>For individual videos, head to the <strong>Content </strong>tab, then <strong>Languages</strong>, where you can preview, publish, unpublish, or delete audio tracks. Viewers can switch between the original and dubbed audio anytime from the video’s settings menu.</p><p>Back in 2023, YouTube first tested the feature with a small group of creators, including big names like MrBeast, Mark Rober, and chef Jamie Oliver.</p><p>YouTube says the pilot was a big win. In fact, creators using multi-language audio saw over 25% of their watch time come from viewers in other languages. Chef Jamie Oliver’s channel is a standout case, with viewership tripling after adding dubbed tracks.</p><p>For viewers, this opens up way more content since you can skip the subtitles and just listen to the translated audio.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Gone is the circular camera module design that was a OnePlus staple, replaced with what looks like an iPhone-inspired square module.</p><p>The image shows a square camera module at the top left of the device, with two lenses arranged vertically and a third lens to their right — very similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro</a>.

Even partnerships with OpenAI and ChatGPT weren't enough to help the iPhone compete with mobile AI suites like Google AI or Galaxy AI.</p><p>Apple seemed to learn from its mistakes at the iPhone 16 event; instead of announcing lofty feature goals alongside the iPhone 17 that it couldn't deliver on, it chose not to discuss artificial intelligence at all. The absence of Apple Intelligence talk <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/5-things-apple-stole-from-android-during-the-iphone-17-event">at the company's recent keynote</a> wasn't really a shock, considering key features announced a year prior still aren't ready yet. It begs the following questions: does Apple even need AI to sell iPhones, and do iPhone users even want it?</p><p>The answer to the first question is still up in the air, but we now decisively know that Apple's users do care about AI. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-gemini-app-feature-you-actually-wanted-is-here">Google's Gemini app for iOS</a> recently overtook ChatGPT to become the top free app on the App Store. It's a major win for Google, as it signals that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/i-havent-used-chatgpt-since-2023-heres-why-gemini-is-all-the-ai-i-need">momentum is shifting from ChatGPT to Gemini</a>. Additionally, it's a sign that even as Apple's internal AI efforts may be stalling, iPhone users are getting their mobile AI fix somewhere else.</p><h2 id="why-apple-barely-talked-about-ai-in-its-iphone-17-event-2">Why Apple barely talked about AI in its iPhone 17 event</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2291px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="k24br4t5Pe6THQc8LrsKDe" name="iphone-17-pro-promo-render-from-announcement" alt="Render of the iPhone 17 Pro in all three colors from announcement" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/k24br4t5Pe6THQc8LrsKDe.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2291" height="1289" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Apple's fall keynote was light on AI features, with the biggest one discussed being Live Translation on the AirPods Pro 3 and older models. Apple focused on practical implementations of AI, like Live Translation, which bridges communication barriers by translating conversations to your preferred language in real time. The same strategy can be seen with Workout Buddy, an AI feature for Apple Watch that helps coach you with fitness insights during your session.</p><p>The positioning of new features as practical solutions to real-world problems is a stark contrast to how Apple has talked about AI in the past. At past WWDC keynotes and launch events, the company touted Apple Intelligence features in traditional generative AI implementations, like text editing, image creation, and voice assistance.</p><p>The problem with the latter approach is that Apple's foundation models aren't on-par with those from Google or OpenAI, so <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-pokes-fun-at-apples-iphone-17-ai-capabilities">Apple Intelligence can rarely compete</a> with Gemini or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/chatgpt">ChatGPT</a> in traditional gen-AI tasks. Instead, where the company can make its mark in the AI space is with specific features that leverage Apple hardware for a unique task, much like Live Translation or Workout Buddy.</p><p>While the company is still working on improving Apple Intelligence's capabilities, it's choosing to talk about those gen-AI features in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/09/new-apple-intelligence-features-are-available-today/" target="_blank">press releases</a> rather than lengthy keynote segments. After all, it seems pretty clear that competitors provide a better experience in text and image generation as well as voice assistance than Apple Intelligence and Siri. Now, that's reflected by iPhone users in the App Store's top charts.</p><h2 id="why-gemini-is-a-better-stopgap-for-ios-users-than-chatgpt-2">Why Gemini is a better stopgap for iOS users than ChatGPT</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6B2GausoFaHwvVDEyc4H28" name="google-gemini-response-iphone-16-pro-max" alt="Google Gemini response on iPhone 16 Pro Max" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6B2GausoFaHwvVDEyc4H28.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Gemini is now the top free app on the App Store, and this is an impressive feat that shows just how far Google AI has come. Across 483,000 ratings, the Gemini app for iOS has 4.8 out of five stars, which is standout performance. It's also the number one app in the productivity category, ahead of ChatGPT and Google's own Gmail app.</p><p>Out of the thousands of reviews for the Gemini app on the App Store, there's one that really exemplifies why Apple users are flocking toward Google for their AI needs. "I wasn't sure if this app would work as advertised but it absolutely does," writes user Jrich828. "Siri does not work as well for me but Gemini has managed to answer all my quirky questions. Love it!"</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="qunooZwp5zNtuD5yxznFC8" name="google-gemini-lock-screen-widgets-iphone-16-pro-max" alt="Google Gemini lock screen widgets on iPhone 16 Pro Max next to Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qunooZwp5zNtuD5yxznFC8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That's the jist of why iPhone users are starting to use Gemini in droves. It's not just that Google's AI is useful — that wouldn't be enough for people inside the Apple ecosystem to give Gemini a try. Further, it's that Apple Intelligence and Siri are failing to fulfill a need, so iOS users are looking for something better.</p><p>While it's just one app review, the above sentiment is extremely common in Apple circles. Siri has been behind the curve dating back to the Google Assistant days, and Gemini can simply run circles around Apple's AI offerings. On top of that, Gemini is really easy to use on iPhone. You can add Gemini widgets to your home and lock screens for easy access, and even open the app with a voice command if you're savvy with Shortcuts.</p><p>Even as Apple partners with ChatGPT for Apple Intelligence, users are going out of their way to try Gemini. Aside from the above factors, I suspect iOS users are eager to use Google AI because<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/i-might-use-an-iphone-but-i-cant-live-without-these-google-apps"> they're familiar with other Google apps and services</a>, like Gmail, Search, or YouTube. The Google ecosystem may not feel as familiar as Apple's, but it's not foreign either.</p><p>Gemini becoming the top free app on the App Store is an indication that iPhone users have spoken. Gemini and ChatGPT are numbers one and two on the platform. Users want AI on their phones, but they'd <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-should-ditch-siri-for-gemini-and-google-cloud-heres-why">rather have better third-party options than Apple Intelligence</a>.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="7717a8a0-0fec-474b-9919-97aaacb39853">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GDvuEpuneFYQKQMvgu3z7C.jpg' alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro in Moonstone"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 10 Pro</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Gemini at the core</strong></em></p><p>While the Gemini app works great on iPhone, it's deeply integrated with Android 16 on the Google Pixel 10 Pro.
