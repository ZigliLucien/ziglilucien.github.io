Now, Google is updating the app on iOS and Android to add a dedicated tab for visual content called Images. Following prior tests, the Google app is gaining a Discover-style hub for photos and graphics in the U.S. starting this week.</p><p>The company explains in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/feed/search-images-tab-browse-organize/" target="_blank">blog post</a> that despite Google Images' popularity, users find it hard to describe exactly what they're looking for. That's where the Images tab in the Google app comes into play. It'll show users new images daily based on their interests, and the algorithm will adjust over time as interests evolve.</p><p>"We’re making that inspiration even easier to find with a new way to discover visual content in the Google app," Google says.</p><p>That sounds like a mix of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-personalize-google-discover-feed">Google Discover</a>, which curates news and entertainment content based on your interests, or social sites like Pinterest. Google calls the Images tab "a new way to explore and organize images in the Google app." It's located at the bottom of the Google app homepage, next to the Home, Search, Notifications, and Activity tabs.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="coNbK7ug3zk4hUBfyhcfLZ" name="Google-Search-IMages" alt="The Images tab in the Google app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/coNbK7ug3zk4hUBfyhcfLZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>After discovering visual content in the Images tab, users can save it to their collections in the Google app. You can also use images you find to search for new ones.

Case in point: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-review">OnePlus 15</a> was announced globally on November 13, 2025, just 10 months after the launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/one-year-with-the-oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a>.</p><p>With the OnePlus 15 now available, the Chinese manufacturer is hard at work on next year's phone. There isn't much we know about the OnePlus 16 at this point in time, but as always, we can make a few educated guesses.</p><p>Having used the OnePlus 15, I want to see a few changes on the OnePlus 16, namely around the design and cameras. I'll be updating this post over the coming months as more information starts becoming available about the OnePlus 16, but for now, this is what we know so far, and what I'd want to see in the OnePlus' next flagship.</p><h2 id="oneplus-16-i-need-a-differentiated-design-2">OnePlus 16: I need a differentiated design</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5159px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="HUSgHZEA8JHpY3CUteSqDN" name="OnePlus 15" alt="OnePlus 15 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HUSgHZEA8JHpY3CUteSqDN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5159" height="2906" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I don't like the design of the OnePlus 15 — it looks too generic, and doesn't really have any of the flair that made earlier devices stand out. While I get that phone design in general is amalgamating into a boxy aesthetic that emulates iPhones, several brands have managed to differentiate their phones; Google's Pixel 10 Pro XL has an even bolder camera bar, Samsung's use of individual accents around its cameras is unique, and Vivo always rolls out phones with massive camera islands.</p><p>With OnePlus, I just don't see that identity. If anything, the OnePlus 15 feels like an off-brand imitation of the Find X8, and I want the OnePlus 16 to resemble the OnePlus 13 — at least that phone had a distinctive design.</p><h2 id="i-want-to-see-better-cameras-on-the-oneplus-16-2">I want to see better cameras on the OnePlus 16</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5078px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="gVN3dQhzBBwE6peKoMv28N" name="OnePlus 15" alt="OnePlus 15 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gVN3dQhzBBwE6peKoMv28N.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5078" height="2860" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Look, the OnePlus 15 has decent cameras, and it does a good enough job in most scenarios. In fact, it holds its own against the Pixel 10 and Galaxy S25.</p><p>However, it just doesn't measure up to its Chinese rivals, and both the Find X8 and Vivo X300 have much better cameras. An issue in this regard is that OnePlus is using older modules, with the main camera having a smaller sensor than last year.</p><p>I don't understand the reasoning behind this, and although the device takes slightly better shots than the OnePlus 13, the difference isn't noteworthy.</p><p>Then there's the Hasselblad integration — or lack thereof. OnePlus was the company that actually partnered with Hasselblad, so to not see the Swedish camera giant's tuning on the OnePlus 16 is annoying. The device instead gets a new DetailMax engine, and I don't know who came up with that name, but it is a misnomer to say the least.</p><p>With the OnePlus 16, the manufacturer needs to at least use the same caliber of camera sensors as its Chinese rivals.</p><h2 id="oneplus-16-will-likely-have-these-specs-2">OnePlus 16 will likely have these specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="VUHAVvBqFACyscpCzya4JN" name="OnePlus 15" alt="OnePlus 15 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VUHAVvBqFACyscpCzya4JN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5080" height="2861" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It doesn't take much to guess that the OnePlus 16 will be powered by Qualcomm's next flagship silicon, nor that the phone will have a massive battery. Honestly, my favorite feature on the OnePlus 15 is the 7,300mAh battery, and I want to see this continue next year.</p><p>We will also likely get the same 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage on the base model, and I'd like to see the 1TB model debut globally — I still don't get why this is limited to China.</p><h2 id="oneplus-16-may-launch-just-as-early-2">OnePlus 16 may launch just as early</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="rJbPbH5SoFK5QoP3RiFVDN" name="OnePlus 15" alt="OnePlus 15 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rJbPbH5SoFK5QoP3RiFVDN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While I have no information on when the OnePlus 16 may possibly debut, it is likely to follow the same cadence as this year. That means a launch in China in early Q4 followed by a global release later in the quarter.</p><p>Of course, OnePlus may just decide to push up the schedule, meaning we could see the OnePlus 16 sooner. As of now, there isn't much in the way of details about the device, but I will add details to this post when that changes.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This ensures that all radio technologies in the phone, including cellular, Wi Fi, and Bluetooth, comply with FCC regulations.</p><p>However, because of the government shutdown in the US, which ended just a day before the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-review">OnePlus 15</a> launched, OnePlus was unable to get the smartphone approved by the FCC.

But with the FCC catching up on over a month of delayed work due to the shutdown, it is hard to say when the OnePlus 15 will actually reach the market.</p><p>The company says it hopes the approvals can be generated quickly so it can release the phone in the country. However, for now, if you want to know when the smartphone will be available, you can go to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oneplus.com/us">OnePlus.com/us</a> and enter your details, and OnePlus will email you once the phone is ready for purchase.</p><p>As for pricing, OnePlus has revealed that the OnePlus 15 will cost $899 in the U.S. whenever it becomes available for the base variant with 12 GB of RAM and 256 GB of storage. This matches the price of the OnePlus 13 in the country, which in itself is pretty interesting given the current tariff situation.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The smartphone features a large battery, Qualcomm's latest mobile processor, and more.</p><p>While the Galaxy S25 Plus isn't an ambitious option, it may be the more appealing option for most people.

OnePlus spent years remaining creative in smartphone design, prioritizing curvy chassis, unique camera bumps, and leather back options. This year, the brand broke from its standard mold, making the OnePlus 15 body with entirely flat surfaces on all sides.</p><p>It's a sharp departure from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-13s-review">OnePlus 13</a>, which sported a curved design on the front and back. However, flat and boxy designs have been popular among flagship phones from Apple, Samsung, and Google for years, so it's not exactly innovative. The circular camera arrangement is gone in favor of a standard square. The material itself is less flashy — it's just aluminum — but OnePlus did add a ceramic-like feel.</p><p>On the side, the classic OnePlus Alert Slider is replaced with a Plus Key, which is kind of like an iPhone Action button. The phone measures 161.4 x 76.7 x 8.1 mm, making it on the thicker side. It's somewhat heavy, weighing 211 grams.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3777px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="zgQpJdKHPCKF3hLgqTtCHW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-review-hero-16-9" alt="Galaxy S25 Plus outdoors in wet, rainy weather" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zgQpJdKHPCKF3hLgqTtCHW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3777" height="2125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus</a> is similarly a flat rectangle, with even fewer interesting design cues.

You can get the phone with either 12GB or 16GB of RAM, depending on the storage configuration.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus is no slouch, offering optimizations of its own. It's powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> for Galaxy — the last-gen version of the chip inside the OnePlus 15, but with Samsung efficiency upgrades. The next Galaxy Plus model will likely be based on the same Qualcomm mobile platform as the OnePlus 15, so keep that in mind if you're on the fence.</p><div ><table><caption>Specs</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>OnePlus 15</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.78-inch 1.5K AMOLED, 165Hz Adaptive Refresh Rate</p></td><td  ><p>6.7-inch QHD+ AMOLED 2X, 120Hz Adaptive Refresh Rate</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>12GB / 16GB</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 512GB UFS 4.1</p></td><td  ><p>256GB, 512GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 1</p></td><td  ><p>50MP Wide, f/1.8, 24mm</p></td><td  ><p>50MP Wide</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 2</p></td><td  ><p>50MP Periscope telephoto, f/2.8, 80mm</p></td><td  ><p>10MP 3x Telephoto</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 3</p></td><td  ><p>50MP Ultrawide, f/2.0,  16mm</p></td><td  ><p>12MP Ultrawide</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Front Camera</p></td><td  ><p>32MP wide, f/2.4</p></td><td  ><p>12MP, wide hole-punch camera</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ingress Protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP66, IP68, IP69, IP69K</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>5G, Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6.0</p></td><td  ><p>5G (sub6, mmW), Wi-Fi 7, UWB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>7,300mAh</p></td><td  ><p>4,900mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging</p></td><td  ><p>80-100W/120W wired, 50W wireless, 10W reverse wireless, 5W reverse wired</p></td><td  ><p>Super Fast Charging 2.0 (45W), Fast Wireless Charging 2.0, Wireless PowerShare, Qi2 Ready</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>161.4 x 76.7 x 8.1 mm</p></td><td  ><p>158.4mm x 75.8 x 7.3mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>211g or 215g</p></td><td  ><p>190g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>OxygenOS 16 w/ Android 16</p></td><td  ><p>One UI 7 (Android 15) [upgradeable]</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>It's in the battery life category that the OnePlus 15 really shines. The OnePlus 13 was already a battery life champion, and the OnePlus 15 offers 21% more capacity. That makes for a total capacity of 7,300mAh — long enough to last multiple days. You can even play high-level games for up to 6.6 hours on a single charge at 165 FPS, according to OnePlus.</p><p>The OnePlus 15's battery dwarfs the 4,900mAh cell inside the Galaxy S25 Plus. It'll probably still last a full day, but it's nowhere near as impressive as the one in the OnePlus 15. The latter also charges faster, at up to 120W over a cable or 80W in some regions.</p><p>Each phone is equipped with three rear cameras. The OnePlus 15 has a trio of 50MP cameras that include a primary, ultrawide, and telephoto shooter. Meanwhile, the Galaxy S25 Plus has a 50MP main camera, 12MP ultrawide, and 10MP telephoto camera. Notably, the Galaxy S25 Plus' camera system dates back to the Galaxy S22 series.</p><h2 id="oneplus-15-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-software-2">OnePlus 15 vs. Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus: Software</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xbX2s4jyw7XgVtpsg9732H" name="oneplus-15-quick-toggles" alt="The quick toggles buttons on a OnePlus 15 running Oxygen OS 16" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xbX2s4jyw7XgVtpsg9732H.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The OnePlus 15 ships with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-oxygenos-16-arrives-as-a-software-that-truly-knows-you">OxygenOS 16</a>, based on Android 16.

It utilizes silicon-carbon battery technology and a dual-cell approach to deliver one of the largest capacities we've ever seen in an Android phone. Paired with a gaming-first build featuring a 160Hz display, this phone is ideal for power users and enthusiasts.</p><p>However, longtime roadblocks to buying OnePlus phones still apply. They aren't sold through carriers, which is how most people upgrade in the U.S. They also don't have as familiar or well-supported software, although six years is certainly an improvement. These obstacles will likely still deter people from trying the OnePlus 15.</p><p>Samsung's Galaxy S25 Plus will be hard-pressed to compete with the OnePlus 15 on a hardware level. Its consumer AI suite is much stronger, though, and One UI 8 is better than OxygenOS 16. Best of all, it is guaranteed to get seven years of Android OS upgrades. As such, even if the Galaxy S25 Plus isn't as flashy, it'll probably be the best 6.7-inch Android phone for most.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="229b4716-acf0-47b8-b07e-a0d4355f5338">            <a href="https://www.oneplus.com/us/oneplus-15" data-model-name="OnePlus 15" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KTcf69eMUZC6mgdp6F2uYJ.jpg' alt="OnePlus 15"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">OnePlus 15</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>All-in on hardware</strong></em></p><p>The OnePlus 15 stands out due to its massive 7,300mAh that could last you multiple days on a single charge.

Google had a go at delivering a reliable solution with Soli on the Pixel 4, but recent devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/with-the-pixel-10-pro-xl-google-finally-made-a-faultless-flagship">Pixel 10 Pro XL</a> rely on software and a combination of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-tensor-g5">Tensor G5</a>. Huawei also dabbled in secure face unlock for a while, adding a dedicated ToF sensor to its phones.</p><p>Thankfully, facial recognition tech is about to get a much-needed upgrade. Metalenz is a U.S. fabless optics company that works on biometric security, and its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://metalenz.com/polareyes-polarization-imaging-system/polar-id/">Polar ID tech</a> is now in mass production. The tech was initially showcased two years ago, and it uses a custom imaging system that uses polarization sensing to deliver a secure face unlock solution. The video below illustrates the tech in action:</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gjZFulO0jk" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Metalenz demonstrated the effectiveness of Polar ID on a Snapdragon reference device, so it shouldn't be too much of a hassle to roll out the tech on various Android devices that leverage Qualcomm's silicon. Where Polar ID stands out is that it uses a single meta-optic lens and an IR illuminator, making the module size considerably smaller. This should allow device makers to integrate the solution on their phones without resorting to a bigger cutout, and that's a definite bonus.</p><p>Metalenz just teamed up with Taiwanese fab UMC to start production of the Polar ID modules on a 40nm node, and the brand's CEO Rob Devlin notes that the Polar ID tech is "ready to meet the demands of high-volume consumer electronics." The only thing left is for Android device makers to leverage the module in their devices, and we'll have to wait and see how long that takes.</p> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>While I subscribe to Apple Music and YouTube Music, I use Spotify the most — a lot of that has to do with the fact that it has better playlists and recommendations. That said, the lack of a lossless tier has been a major issue for a while now, and Spotify is addressing that with the introduction of its Premium Platinum plan in India, following its rollout in other global markets.</p><p>The plan lets you listen to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify/spotify-lossless-listening-premium-subscribers-hear-every-refined-note-launch">lossless music in Spotify</a> with bitrate of up to 24-bit/44.1kHz, and it's just great to be able to stream higher-quality music on Spotify. While it has been a long time coming, what isn't so great is the pricing: the Premium Platinum costs ₹299 ($3.38), which is a 40% increase from the ₹179 ($2) family plan. Annoyingly, the family plan is no longer available for new subscribers, and has been moved to the legacy tier — if you subscribe to it, you can continue using it.</p><p>I used Spotify's family plan for close to a decade now, subscribing in the U.S. and switching over to Indian pricing when the service debuted in the country. Honestly, the Indian family plan always felt like it was an unbeatable value, and it's clear why Spotify chose to go with ₹179 — Apple Music's family plan also costs the same in India.</p><p>That is what makes the Premium Platinum price hike a little jarring; with Apple Music still continuing to cost ₹179, Spotify's lossless tier is 40% costlier, and I don't think the plan will find many takers in the country. While I don't have an issue as such with the new pricing — I pay the same for YouTube Premium and don't use it anywhere as much — what's egregious is that the Premium Platinum plan is limited to just three accounts, half as much as the previous family plan.</p><p>Basically, I now have to take two Premium Platinum plans to be able to get the same features as my earlier family plan, just so that I can listen to lossless music. That comes out to ₹598 ($6.75) a month, which is a 70% increase from before. Spotify also states that the plan has AI-assisted DJ and AI playlists, and honestly, I see that as a downside.</p><p>I switched over to the Premium Platinum plan as I've been waiting to use Spotify lossless for a while now, but limiting it to three accounts is just plain annoying. Not having a standard family plan as an alternative is just asinine — particularly when all other music streaming platforms have one. If anything, I think this will be the impetus that will get me to switch to Apple Music wholesale.</p> ]]></dc:content>

What I enjoy the most about the M23 is the power and neutral sound — it basically allows IEMs and connected headsets to shine, and it lets me access to my favorite music platforms, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/roon-has-transformed-how-i-listen-to-music">Roon</a>.</p><p>Coming in at $719, the M23 is solidly in the mid-range, so when Fiio said it was rolling out a new model that's much more affordable, I was interested. The M21 has a smaller 4.7-inch panel and 4,000mAh battery, but it lasts longer, and it comes with Android 13, which in itself is a big deal as most other audio players I'm using are still on Android 10 or Android 12.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5158px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="DMo5yZhxp3oJasYuuTrDvb" name="Fiio M21" alt="Fiio M21 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DMo5yZhxp3oJasYuuTrDvb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5158" height="2905" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What's notable is that the M23 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/FiiO-M21-Snapdragon-Bluetooth-Blue-Black/dp/B0F8HTXH1N">costs $329 on Amazon</a>, making it that much easier to recommend. Oh, and did I mention it has 950mW of power at 32Ω? That's unheard of in this category. Finally, Fiio has a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://hifigo.com/products/fiio-m21?srsltid=AfmBOopmearwl59GWe3MVCtxSyUXQnAmMkwnrYAYgH0FjtD0VrnbuaXd&variant=46469224300783">delightful cassette case</a> aimed at the M21; the case makes the audio player look like a cassette player — much like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-cp13-cassette-player-review">Fiio CP13</a> — and this is easily one of my favorite Fiio accessories.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4797px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="2FBhQzS5RYPjCcBZA4ysob" name="Fiio M21" alt="Fiio M21 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2FBhQzS5RYPjCcBZA4ysob.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4797" height="2702" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With that out of the way, let's get to the design. The M21 has a distinctly different feel to it than other Fiio players, and I like the new aesthetic quite a bit. The rear of the device has a frosted glass finish, and it makes holding and using it that much more comfortable. If anything, it feels closer to a phone-like finish, and I like it a lot.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4976px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="oZovBY4TRE3J4m5s96DAob" name="Fiio M21" alt="Fiio M21 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oZovBY4TRE3J4m5s96DAob.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4976" height="2803" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another positive is that the finish prevents smudges and micro-scratches, and this is a big deal — my M23 constantly needs cleaning, and I just didn't have to bother doing that with the M21. The smaller size also makes a difference in usability, and at 193g, the M21 isn't anywhere as heavy as the M23 or even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-m15s-review">M15S</a>. That's a good thing considering it is made out of aluminum, and the build quality is just as great as Fiio's high-end players.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5169px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.34%;"><img id="z7SYcAfFsE3qpyFXBitwyb" name="Fiio M21" alt="Fiio M21 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/z7SYcAfFsE3qpyFXBitwyb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5169" height="2912" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The 4.7-inch 720p resolution is decent enough, and while it doesn't come close to what you get on most phones these days, it is entirely serviceable. The audio player gets the power button and volume rocker on the left alongside the multifunction button, and they have good tactility. The playback controls are on the right, and again, they have good feedback.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5110px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="Yp4yfnGhofq9GQN6F9fcmb" name="Fiio M21" alt="Fiio M21 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Yp4yfnGhofq9GQN6F9fcmb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5110" height="2878" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I like that the buttons are accented in gold; this differentiates the design a little bit, providing a nice contrast to the blue hue of the device itself. The M21 gets a single-ended 3.5mm port alongside a balance 4.4mm out, and you get USB-C connectivity in addition to a dedicated USB-C port that solely draws power. This is useful because the M21 has a desktop mode, allowing you to bypass its internal battery and solely use USB power.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="C65tH4UFk5JB6zYSAw7Arb" name="Fiio M21" alt="Fiio M21 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C65tH4UFk5JB6zYSAw7Arb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This ensures the battery isn't affected when using the M21 in desktop mode, and I'm glad to see this mode available on what is ostensibly a budget player. Rounding out the connectivity, you get a MicroSD slot. The M21 also gets pogo connectors on the rear, and these are used to pair it with the unique cassette case.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="6k5PVSEQCgEUUtXXJcKTyb" name="Fiio M21" alt="Fiio M21 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6k5PVSEQCgEUUtXXJcKTyb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The cassette case is much better than the usual leather cases that Fiio has with its digital audio players. I get why it isn't bundled, but if you're interested in the M21 and are hankering for a bit of nostalgia, I highly recommend getting the cassette case. It not only provides much-needed protection, but you also get physical controls — you can change music playback controls and adjust volume, with the case connecting to the M21 via magnetic pogo connectors.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="4qbDJWa9QojV8RCUPSV2zb" name="Fiio M21" alt="Fiio M21 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4qbDJWa9QojV8RCUPSV2zb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In fact, in this mode, the M21 solely relies on physical controls, and it turns the device into a cassette player, and it's just plain cool. I'll admit that I used this mode a lot more than I initially imagined, and the novelty doesn't really go away. The case itself is made out of plastic, but build quality is decent, and I haven't had any issues with it. The only quibble is that when you slot the M21 in the case, you lose access to the buttons on the left side of the device.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5042px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="bWTZsujKrd7AqHMrnmDnvb" name="Fiio M21" alt="Fiio M21 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bWTZsujKrd7AqHMrnmDnvb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5042" height="2840" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Switching over to the software, the M21 comes with Android 13 out of the box, and you get full access to the Play Store.

You can easily slot in a 2TB MicroSD card and then use Fiio Music if you want to listen to music locally. There's a 4,000mAh battery, and the M21 lasts over 11 hours between charges. This is better than what I usually get with the M23, so again, the affordable model wins out.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="Pg8FpkYuYQnHvwtSjzzqwb" name="Fiio M21" alt="Fiio M21 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Pg8FpkYuYQnHvwtSjzzqwb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Coming to power, the M21 provides 380mW at 16Ω and 290mW at 32Ω over the 3.5mm port, and 540mW at 16Ω and a generous 950mW at 32Ω via the balanced 4.4mm connector. Obviously, that kind of power is overkill, and in my use, the M21 managed to drive just about every IEM and headset I connected to it without any issues whatsoever. I used it with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-ft7-is-the-flagship-killer-of-planar-headsets">Fiio FT7</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-ft5-review">FT5</a>, switching over to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/thieaudio-monarch-mkiii-best-iem-ive-used-yet">Thieaudio Monarch MKIII</a> IEMs occasionally.</p><p>The sound signature is similar to other Fiio digital audio players, with the M21 offering a neutral sound with a hint of warmth that livens things up. There's good energy in the low-end, clean mids with a focus on vocals, and good treble without any sibilance. It isn't as resolving as the M23, but it is mighty close, and it is much easier to use, and I ended up just switching to the M21 because of its portability.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="DWe9xYrtvk9ZVK8szLHCub" name="Fiio M21" alt="Fiio M21 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DWe9xYrtvk9ZVK8szLHCub.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Ultimately, the M21 has proven to be a realization.

Two options to consider are the Nothing Phone 3a Lite vs. Moto G Power 2025. Both sell for under $300, though the Nothing Phone 3a Lite is exclusive to select markets in the U.K. and Europe, for now at least. You can, it should be noted, get its step-up variant, the Nothing Phone 3a, in North America for a bit more. As far as sub-$300 phones go, however, both these devices are worth considering if you can get your hands on them.</p><h2 id="nothing-phone-3a-lite-vs-moto-g-power-2025-design-and-basic-features-2">Nothing Phone 3a Lite vs. Moto G Power 2025: Design and basic features</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oVxhdHofgz3oQ5uB86kJE6" name="Nothing Phone 3a Lite" alt="Nothing Phone 3a Lite" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oVxhdHofgz3oQ5uB86kJE6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nothing)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothings-3a-lite-debuts">Nothing Phone 3a Lite</a> was introduced in late October 2025 as the company's budget-friendly option. It features a 6.77-inch flexible AMOLED HDR10+ display with a 2,392 x 1,084 resolution, which is quite impressive for a phone of this price. The up to 3,000 nits peak brightness also makes it comfortable to view outdoors in bright sunlight. The 120Hz adaptive refresh rate is another impressive feature for such an affordable phone.</p><p>Made with high-grade tempered glass and machined aluminum accents, it comes in only black or white, yet still stands out from other phones. That's thanks to Nothing's signature panda glass finish with glyph light that's designed to help you cut down on screen time. Rather than the phone dinging and pinging every time you get a message or notification, this light serves as your guide to only address what's important.</p><p>There are custom light patterns for notifications, like contacts and calls. It will flash only for essential notifications based on keywords, contacts, and apps you set. It also functions as a countdown for a timer when you're taking a photo.</p><p>The glyph interface encourages you not to grab for your phone and see what's going on every time it beckons. You won't miss out on an important message from your mum, child's teacher, or spouse, but you also won't be distracted by the mundane notifications designed to keep you glued to your screen unnecessarily.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WfvnFiGCupBzZXSAMKv8A6" name="Nothing Phone 3a Lite" alt="Nothing Phone 3a Lite" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WfvnFiGCupBzZXSAMKv8A6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nothing)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The phone isn't terribly durable, but it does meet a decent IP54 rating, which means it can withstand limited dust exposure and light splashes of water. The 5,000mAh battery will provide up to 2 hours of YouTube viewing or 16 hours of mixed use, so it won't even last a full day. It does, however, charge at a rate of 33W and supports fast charging, allowing you to reach 50% in just 20 minutes; it takes one hour to charge to full capacity. It also supports 5W reverse charging.</p><p>Storage options are 128GB and 256GB, but the good news is that it is expandable via memory card up to 2TB. This is a rarity, as few phones nowadays have a memory card slot, sacrificing it for slimmer and sleeker designs, along with a focus on cloud storage. It does not, however, have a headphone jack.</p><p>Topping this off is a fingerprint sensor, NFC with support for Google Pay, dual SIMs, 5G connectivity, and Bluetooth 5.4. Notably, the Nothing Phone 3a Lite features a single mono speaker, so you may not want to listen to music or engage in intense gaming sessions with this phone, as there's no immersive experience.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4167px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vbu6eGUni2DDKBs8rt8XxG" name="Moto-G-Power-2025-review-06" alt="The Moto G Power 2025 against a blue background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vbu6eGUni2DDKBs8rt8XxG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4167" height="2344" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What about the Moto G Power 2025? Introduced in January 2025, the Moto G Power 2025 comes in Leaf Green or Slate Gray. Android Central managing editor Derrek Lee calls the Leaf Green in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-power-2025-review">his review of this phone</a> a standout, describing it as vibrant. The phone has a slightly larger 6.8-inch LCD screen with a smidge lower resolution of 2,388 x 1,080. You get a 120Hz refresh rate that affords a smooth navigation experience. Brightness taps out at 1,000 nits, though Lee says it's "plenty bright," and he had no trouble viewing the screen in any lighting conditions.</p><p>Made with vegan leather on the back that pleasantly doesn't attract fingerprints, combined with a Gorilla Glass 5 screen, durability is a strong point with this phone. It not only meets MIL-STD-810H certification for withstanding drops, bumps, and falls, but it also meets both IP68 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care" target="_blank">IP69</a> ratings for dust and water resistance. So, it can not only be submerged in water for a limited period, but it can also withstand high-pressure water jets and extreme temperatures.</p><p>It has the same 5,000mAh battery and supports a slightly slower charging rate of 30W, but with Motorola TurboPower. It also adds 15W wireless charging to the mix. Lee says the Moto G Power 2025 comfortably lasts throughout a full day. It taps out at 128GB storage, but like the Nothing Phone 3a Lite, you can expand this via an optional microSD card.

Note, however, that Lee finds the feature almost unusable, negatively impacting performance in a way that suggests you're better off not using it at all. Nonetheless, sticking with just the 8GB RAM should be fine for basic productivity, even light gaming like <em>Minecraft</em>.</p><p>Running Android 15 with Hello UX, it works with gesture controls as well, which Lee loves. You can do things like double-chop the phone to turn on the flashlight, double-twist to launch the camera, and double-tap on the back to open a favorite app. He also appreciates the Sidebar feature for housing frequently used apps. What he doesn't love, however, is the amount of bloatware that comes with the phone, including pre-installed apps you might not want and have to go through the trouble of uninstalling if desired.</p><p>Overall, Lee says performance with the Moto G Power 2025 isn't as big of an issue as you might think, with managed expectations. "The phone can surprisingly manage [<em>Honkai: Star Rail</em>] at visual settings set to 'High' and at 60fps, which is honestly still a great way to play the game." AI features are missing from this pretty bare-bones device, so you're getting what you pay for in this respect. However, the Nothing Phone 3a Lite also lacks high-end AI features.</p><h2 id="nothing-phone-3a-lite-vs-moto-g-power-2025-the-cameras-2">Nothing Phone 3a Lite vs. Moto G Power 2025: The cameras</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9JFfKCExC4ujRCvrpuDEA6" name="Nothing Phone 3a Lite" alt="Nothing Phone 3a Lite" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9JFfKCExC4ujRCvrpuDEA6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nothing)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Neither of these phones has cameras to rival premium phones, but they will capture decent photos. The Nothing Phone 3a Lite features a triple camera system with the TrueLens Engine, which includes a 50MP primary camera, an 8MP ultra-wide lens, a 2MP macro lens, and a 16MP front-facing camera. You get from 0.6 up to 10x zoom, which is not bad.</p><p>Features include Ultra XDR, auto tone, portrait optimizer, motion photo, night mode, macro mode through the dedicated lens, and video capture up to 4K at 30 frames per second (1,080P at 30 or 60 fps). There aren't any fancy AI features, though there is AI stabilization in low-light conditions. You can also capture slo-mo videos and time-lapse with EIS image stabilization.</p><p>That's pretty much all there is to say about the cameras. We haven't tried them out, but Android Central's Nicholas Sutrich notes in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review">his review of the step-up Nothing Phone 3a and 3a Pro </a>that the camera system in the Nothing Phone 3a is pretty impressive. It has a similar 50MP primary sensor but larger sensors for the other cameras. So you likely won't get the same performance with this Lite model, but you'll be able to snap fun photos and videos for social sharing.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4132px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="AYT7P26cQRZdu5PB9su5fF" name="Moto-G-Power-2025-review-09" alt="The Moto G Power 2025 on the corner of a table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AYT7P26cQRZdu5PB9su5fF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4132" height="2324" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Comparatively, the Moto G Power 2025 has almost identical camera specs to the Nothing Phone 3a Lite with a 50MP primary camera, an 8MP ultrawide camera with a macro-vision lens, and a 16MP front camera. The front camera has a Face Retouch feature to help reduce wrinkles and blemishes.</p><p>It has an ambient light sensor while OIS ensures blur-free images. There's also Quad Pixel technology, so you get good photos in various lighting conditions. Lee says you can get good shots in favorable lighting, and selfies are decent. But he admits images are noisy and often lack detail, while the phone doesn't perform well in low-light situations. Auto Enhance, however, is useful, helping improve images after they have been captured.</p><h2 id="nothing-phone-3a-lite-vs-moto-g-power-2025-which-one-should-you-choose-2">Nothing Phone 3a Lite vs. Moto G Power 2025: Which one should you choose?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="acPkVEm54pD7ddw4JV6ekb" name="Nothing-Phone-3a-Lite" alt="Nothing Phone 3a Lite arrives" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/acPkVEm54pD7ddw4JV6ekb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nothing)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Both these phones rank among <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones-under-300">the best sub-$300 Android phones</a> you can buy. The obvious elephant in the room between the Nothing Phone 3a Lite vs. the Moto G Power 2025 is that the former is not available in North America right now. You can opt for the step-up Nothing Phone 3a, which costs approximately $100 more, or the Nothing Phone 3a Pro, which is about $150 more. If you do this, you're getting plenty of improvements, most notably more RAM, a Snapdragon processor, and better cameras.</p><p>Choosing a Nothing phone like the Nothing Phone 3a Lite is about wanting to reduce screen time. You can still accomplish all the important tasks with this phone, including surfing the web, accessing social media, snapping photos and shooting videos, and even playing games. But it's designed to help you disconnect as much as it is to connect.</p><p>The Moto G Power 2025's design may not outright promote it, but it is a basic phone designed for teens, the elderly, those on a budget, or individuals with only light productivity and entertainment needs. Lee calls it a "solid $300 phone," basically noting that you get what you pay for, and it's alright. There are no frills, and it can feel sluggish if you try to overtax the system. But it's great for battery life and fast charging, and it's ultra tough for grandma or your kid who tends to drop their phone several times a day.</p><p>Assuming you <em>can</em> get your hands on either phone and your budget is airtight for under $300, the decision comes down to what's most important. However, I'd recommend saving up that extra hundred bucks to upgrade, rather than trying to find your way around; getting the budget Lite version is a good option if you aren't in the U.K. or Europe anyway.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="a6cfa4ec-e3c3-4451-abb8-222568b30c1c">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/whAhqxzE7zznMLx2LbJ896.jpg' alt="Nothing Phone 3a Lite"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class='featured__brand'>Nothing</div>                                        <div class="featured__title">Nothing Phone 3a Lite</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Minimize distractions</strong></em></p><p>If your ultimate goal is to get a phone you only need to use when you really need it and not to use for everything under the sun, the Nothing Phone 3a Lite is designed to help curb your reliance on screens.

The Nvidia Shield has been the complete opposite. The company has continued supporting the device for years. It rolled out an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/nvidia-shield-tv-october-2024-update">update around the same time last year</a>, and now it is rolling out another update.</p><p>Nvidia detailed the update on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/shield-tv/9/577676/shield-experience-upgrade-922-111225/">community forum</a>, calling it Shield Experience Upgrade 9.2.2.

The update also adds a settings UI for accessibility timeout.</p><p>The update also brings a new Bounce Keys feature, although Nvidia has not explained what the feature actually does. The company notes in the changelog that a bug where audio would drop out when watching Disney+ content should now be fixed.</p><p>The update is rolling out widely for "all" Nvidia Shield users, which means it is not only for the first-generation Shield TV but also the second-generation Shield TV and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv-streamer-vs-nvidia-shield-tv-pro-2019">Shield TV Pro</a>.</p><p>If you own a Nvidia Shield device, you can manually check for the update by going to <strong>Settings > About Shield > System updates</strong>, and selecting <strong>Check for updates</strong>.

This afternoon, I placed my Meta Quest 3 on my head and seamlessly continued my progress in the game, this time with an unparalleled sense of immersion that my Steam Deck could never hope to offer.</p><p>It's this type of hybrid play-as-you-please gaming haven that Valve planted the roots for when it launched the Steam Deck several years ago, which is now entering the blooming stages as the Steam Frame launches in early 2026.</p><p>The Steam Frame, as the new VR headset is called, is a standalone "Steam Deck for your face" that plays VR and non-VR games alike. It doesn't care how you want to play games or what you want to play; it just wants you to play them everywhere and gives you <strong>full</strong> access to the Steam library you already own, making it a powerful addition to any gamer's household.</p><figure class="van-image-figure pull-left inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:661px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:29.95%;"><img id="shw6vroRiUxqcvWLRPZjB6" name="click-to-follow-ac-lloyd-sq-g" alt="Click to Follow Android Central on Google" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/shw6vroRiUxqcvWLRPZjB6.jpg" mos="" align="left" fullscreen="" width="661" height="198" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-left"></p></div></div></figure><p>Enjoy our content?

No, the real draw here is the versatility of the Steam library.</p><p>When I finish a long day of work but recognize that I need physical <em>exercise</em> or movement and not another few hours of sitting on my butt, picking up a Steam Frame and playing a great VR game may just be the answer. Other times, I might want to wind down for the night in bed with a round of Peglin or solving some puzzles in Islands of Insight on my Steam Deck. No matter what, Steam has my back.</p><p>For me, it's this versatility that matters most. Sony is close to having a similar ecosystem with the PS5, but the company falls short in several ways. The PSVR 2 requires a cord to work, online multiplayer requires a monthly paid subscription, and Sony's digital games purchasing policy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/i-wont-buy-another-digital-ps5-game-and-you-shouldnt-either">is squarely anti-consumer</a>. Valve's ecosystem suffers from none of these issues.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="dbGfTGfoee2EuwJeqGSovS" name="meta-quest-3-with-stack-of-game-boxes" alt="A Meta Quest 3 headset with a stack of game boxes next to it" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dbGfTGfoee2EuwJeqGSovS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Like the Meta Quest, Valve's game purchase and return policy is second to none. Don't like a game or want to return it for any reason? You have two weeks from the purchase date or two hours of "trial play," whichever comes first. It's great, and it makes me feel good about spending money on digital games that I'll never have the chance to sell.</p><p>The PS5 has the ability to play physical games, but many games only get digital distribution, particularly the indie titles I enjoy playing most, meaning this isn't a situation where the PS5 has a full advantage.</p><p>The obvious upside of an all-digital library is that I can play my games on any hardware I want, which is something Steam is particularly well-suited for. The Steam OS that runs on Steam Deck and Steam Frame is built to play <em>any</em> Steam game, even ones made for X86-based PCs. The only real hamstring is the hardware power, which will require you to use a PC or cloud service to stream more detailed games.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/06pDiCXFlBI" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Valve even thought of that when building the Steam Frame, as it includes a dedicated streaming USB stick in the box. This stick enables not only Wi-Fi 6E-grade wireless bandwidth, but it also uses a dedicated antenna on the Steam Frame to stream your PC games wirelessly to the headset. That ensures you <em>never</em> run into network traffic issues on your home network since it bypasses that completely.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a> can also stream any Steam game from your PC to the headset, including using a dedicated wireless streaming box <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/PRISMXR-Compatible-Puppis-S1-Lite/dp/B0F9NQRRD3/">like this one I've been testing for months</a>, but the Quest wasn't purpose-built for this and doesn't provide the same ultra-high quality streaming that Steam Frame can.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yGNbwNJGradDJoCZnjSyPZ" name="meta-quest-3-horizon-os-ui-jan-2025-multiple-windows" alt="Using a Meta Quest 3 with six windows open at once" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yGNbwNJGradDJoCZnjSyPZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Meta Horizon OS running multiple windows and apps in mixed reality space. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What's more is that Steam Frame can sideload Android APKs just like the Meta Quest series can. Steam Frame isn't running Android, but Valve's unique Proton and FEX emulation layers allow it to run Android apps and games just as well as it can run Windows apps and games, something that gives the Frame a unique position in the market.</p><p>Samsung's recently released <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-galaxy-xr">Galaxy XR</a> headset can also run Android apps natively since it uses the Android XR operating system and has a unique advantage in that area since it comes with Google services built in. Some apps don't work at all without Google services, which is why this sort of thing never caught on with Meta Quest owners despite its ability to <em>run</em> Android apps natively.</p><h2 id="steam-frame-vs-meta-quest-3-2">Steam Frame vs. Meta Quest 3</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VpUwp64hFNaFtFPnPHnbXc" name="steam-frame-pcgamer-headset" alt="The Steam Frame headset" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VpUwp64hFNaFtFPnPHnbXc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: PCGamer)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Now that I've brought up the Quest 3, it's important to take a look at the two of them side-by-side and see which one is more worth your money. The biggest issue right now is that we don't know the price of the Steam Frame, although Valve says it's aiming to come in at under the $999 price of its previous headset, the Valve Index.</p><p>So we'll throw price out the window for now and just look at the biggest experiential differences between the two systems. The Meta Quest 3 is purpose-built for VR and mixed reality games. Meta owns just over half a dozen game development studios and uses them to pump out AAA VR games like Batman: Arkham VR, Deadpool VR, Asgard's Wrath 2, and even helps fund titles like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/assassins-creed-nexus-vr-review" target="_blank">Assassin's Creed VR</a>, Thief VR, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/metro-awakening-review" target="_blank">Metro Awakening</a>, and more.</p><p>Valve doesn't fund any VR game development and isn't even making a new VR game, which means the latest and greatest is still the 5-year-old <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/half-life-alyx-review">Half-Life: Alyx</a>. That also means we're not getting Portal VR, Counter-Strike VR, Team Fortress VR, DOTA VR, or any other Valve IP I forgot about. If you want AAA VR gaming, the Meta Quest is the obvious headset to buy.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nkUz6Kj4KTb8Pg6tXrvrVc" name="steam-frame-pcgamer-controllers" alt="Both Steam Frame controllers" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nkUz6Kj4KTb8Pg6tXrvrVc.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: PCGamer)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6evhZUuoEaVtMHszKSM9Nc" name="steam-frame-pcgamer-wireless-dongle" alt="The Steam Frame's packed-in wireless dongle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6evhZUuoEaVtMHszKSM9Nc.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: PCGamer)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ojD8ocet6K5UWW8Y5sQuTQ" name="steam-frame-headstrap-front-toms-guide" alt="The Steam Frame headset's removable face place" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ojD8ocet6K5UWW8Y5sQuTQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SrGdP2fFKraJD4GgefW4RQ" name="steam-frame-headstrap-back-toms-guide" alt="The Steam Frame headset's removable head strap" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SrGdP2fFKraJD4GgefW4RQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>If you're more interested in modding VR games like Fallout 4, Skyrim, or just playing VR Chat with the Steam Frame's built-in eye tracking, Valve's headset might be right for you. With a 144Hz display and lighter build, the Frame is designed with PCVR games in mind from the start. Valve calls it a "streaming-first headset" because it recognizes that Steam VR players primarily use the platform to play visually complex games, something a standalone system cannot compete with.</p><p>But that doesn't mean it can't play these VR games without a PC. The company hasn't offered long enough play sessions to make an opinion on this yet, but my guess is that most PCVR games will run fine enough on the Frame in local processing mode, so long as you turn the visuals down. For someone like me, that's just fine. I use a Steam Deck because I prefer the ability to play anywhere I want. Graphics simply aren't high on my list of priorities.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5R7uup7vFFY2ZxXzrWUkFQ" name="steam-frame-controllers-toms-guide" alt="The Steam Frame VR controllers and packed-in wireless dongle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5R7uup7vFFY2ZxXzrWUkFQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Both Valve and Meta have crafted headsets that are designed to be modular, but the Steam Frame seems like it'll win a competition in this area. The front module of the Steam Frame can be easily removed, which contains the lenses and all computing elements. It's just 190g for that module since there's no battery inside, ensuring this headset can be used for years to come without having battery issues.</p><p>Valve also designed the controllers to be a fascinating hybrid of a traditional gaming controller and VR motion controllers. Time will tell if this was a good idea or not, but the company says, "We see it just as a new way to play your entire Steam library," which makes this decision a lot more sense. Given that controllers are easily mappable natively in Steam, this should work nicely for VR titles, too.</p><p>The problem here is that the Steam Frame only has black and white passthrough vision out of the box, while the Meta Quest 3 has full color passthrough. That means there's no chance you'll want to play non-VR games on a Steam Frame while seeing your room, and that's going to be a huge disadvantage for Valve until a color passthrough add-on is sold. Yes, Valve made a port for camera add-ons on the headset.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RYWgAqkweKwWWfQkLSjHth" name="meta-quest-3-with-halo-strap-and-no-facial-interface" alt="Wearing a Meta Quest 3 with a Kiwi Design halo headstrap and no facial interface" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RYWgAqkweKwWWfQkLSjHth.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Whether or not Steam Frame gives PCVR a development boost is up in the air, but it may not take much to move that needle. The Steam Deck, as popular as it seems, has only sold around 5 million units to date, yet it has significantly influenced the world of PC games development in a way that prior PC handheld hardware didn't.</p><p>Regardless of its influence over the PC VR space, I'm excited to play hybrid VR titles like Lumines Arise on this. Being able to play the same game in my bed with a Steam Deck before going to sleep or be fully immersed in it with a Steam Frame is an incredible value proposition, and it makes my Steam library feel even more valuable than it already did. I can't say the same about any other gaming ecosystem on the market.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-faq"><span>FAQ</span></h2><section class="article__schema-question"><h3>What is the Steam Frame?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>The Steam Frame is a new standalone VR headset from Valve, designed to play both VR and non-VR games from your existing Steam library.

By simply asking for "moisturizers suited to your skin type," you will be presented with multiple products, including insights from reviews (such as how a moisturizer feels on the skin), allowing for a quick understanding of the differences.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bfgCT5DCm9cYSPwekf4iaK" name="Shopping-with-Gemini" alt="Google's new AI features transform holiday shopping with 'Buy for Me' and Agentic Calling" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bfgCT5DCm9cYSPwekf4iaK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Additionally, the Gemini app will also feature these new shopping tools so you can shop even when you're chatting with the AI bot.

But that could change, as Google's new "agentic checkout" feature uses price-tracking to help you get desired items within your budget.</p><p>So you can get down to the specifics by tracking an item by size, color, and desired price, and you'll be notified when the price drops on Wayfair, Chewy, Quince, and select Shopify merchants. If that wasn't enough, Google will then purchase it for you on the merchant's site using Google Pay, obviously after taking necessary permissions from you. This feature combines Gemini models and the Shopping Graph, saving you time and money this holiday season.</p><p>These agentic shopping features are available in the U.S. starting today (Nov. 13), and Google says it has plans to roll them out to other countries soon.</p> ]]></dc:content>

That includes not just the higher refresh rate, but also a dedicated touch response chip and a new fluid frame generation feature for supported titles, such as Call of Duty Mobile.</p><p>OnePlus isn't pushing this display as ultrabright despite some obvious improvements in brightness, and the company isn't following Samsung in using an anti-glare layer on the screen, either.

Brightness and dimming methodology are paramount to eye comfort, especially when trying to use a device in a dimly lit environment. Many phones, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review" target="_blank">Pixel 10 Pro,</a> use low-frequency <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks" target="_blank">PWM dimming</a>, which can make them an uncomfortable choice for some people.</p><p>The OnePlus 15 is supremely comfortable thanks to OnePlus's use of DC dimming at medium to high brightness and 2160Hz PWM dimming at low brightness. Not only that, but the modulation rate of the display is impressively low, coming in at roughly 1/3 the rate of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>.</p><p>On the downside, OnePlus doesn't offer dimming options on this display, so what you see is what you get.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3024px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:57.47%;"><img id="WaTs2h7wMYdGGen5EY5EXg" name="oneplus-15-pwm" alt="Measuring the dimming and PWM rates of the OnePlus 15's display at varying brightness levels" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WaTs2h7wMYdGGen5EY5EXg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3024" height="1738" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>OLEDs emit their own light, so, as a result, each time the image refreshes, a dip in brightness occurs. This is known as modulation. Phones like the Galaxy S25 Ultra and Pixel 10 don't attempt to control this brightness dip at all, giving them a very harsh strobing effect at 100% brightness reduction each cycle.</p><p>The OnePlus 15 efficiently manages this brightness dip to a maximum of 35%, meaning that the brightness dip is significantly less harsh and should be comfortable for most people.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ySpQSzNmfqFJoKfe9Jpn6E" name="oneplus-15-100-brightness-comparison" alt="Measuring the peak brightness of the OnePlus 15 at 100% brightness, including high brightness mode (HBM), peak HDR brightness, and with the reduce white point accessibility option enabled" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ySpQSzNmfqFJoKfe9Jpn6E.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>OnePlus shipped its first-ever "reduce white point" accessibility feature with the Android 16-based <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-13-oxygen-os-16-hands-on">Oxygen OS 16</a> update, which reduces the peak brightness of the display for sensitive people. I've found that leaving it at 80% white point reduction makes this the most comfortable flagship display I've used to date.</p><p>OnePlus also shipped its first-ever Motion Cues feature in Oxygen OS 16, adding moving dots to the sides of the display for people who get motion sick. It's something we've seen Honor adopt on its phones in the past year, and it's a great choice for motion sickness-prone individuals.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="uzQzo6CqjvUSN2Aze3xmJE" name="oneplus-15-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-vs-iphone-17-pro-max-sunlight-visibility" alt="Comparing sunlight visibility with an image of a golden autumn mountain on a OnePlus 15, Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, and an Apple iPhone 17 Pro Max" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uzQzo6CqjvUSN2Aze3xmJE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Folks who prefer the highest peak brightness will be happy with this display. It's slightly brighter than the Galaxy S25 Ultra's display without resorting to nasty flickering PWM dimming like Samsung uses, but it's not quite as bright as the Pixel 10 Pro or Pixel 10 Pro XL's displays.</p><p>All of these displays are plenty bright for outdoor viewing, although OnePlus isn't employing an anti-glare filter like Samsung used on the S24 Ultra and S25 Ultra. Still, now that the OnePlus 15 uses a fully flat display, it should be easy enough to find a good tempered glass screen protector with an anti-glare layer applied.</p><p>And thanks to the high-frequency PWM dimming rate, viewing this one in a totally dark room won't tire your eyes out. It also gets down to 1 nit by default or as low as 0.5 nits when "reduce white point" is enabled. That's the darkest I've ever seen a smartphone display get.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:787px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="Ygieemgjy97jSwAcpuSwW4" name="oneplus-15-mura-measurement" alt="Testing for mura on the OnePlus 15's display using a uniform 50% grey image" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ygieemgjy97jSwAcpuSwW4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="787" height="443" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Lastly, the OnePlus 15's OLED display doesn't show any signs of mura, unlike the Galaxy S25 Ultra's display. Mura is the measurement of how uniformly pixels are lit, something that's particularly important on an OLED screen.</p><p>As you can see from the above picture, a uniform 50% grey image produces perfectly uniform pixel illumination when viewed through a macro lens. Displays with poor mura can look grainy, especially at low brightness, and have been a complaint among Galaxy S24 and S25 owners over the years.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-gaming-refresh-rate-and-resolution"><span>Gaming, refresh rate, and resolution</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:426px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.34%;"><img id="teJuePnqDLUJv62sKEucKK" name="oneplus-15-gaming-framerate" alt="Comparing gaming modes for Call of Duty Mobile on the OnePlus 15's 165Hz display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/teJuePnqDLUJv62sKEucKK.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="426" height="240" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Some concerns were raised over OnePlus's decision to choose a higher refresh rate display, as it sacrificed some screen resolution. But even at a reduced resolution of 2772 x 1272 pixels — compared to 3168 x 1440 on the OnePlus 13 — it still pushes a pixel density of 450 PPI.</p><p>That's well more than "retina" resolution, and there's no chance anyone will look at this and see anything less than a gorgeous, crystal-clear high-res screen.</p><p>To enable 165Hz, you'll need to launch a supported title, swipe the OnePlus game launcher out from the sidebar, and check all the boxes to achieve maximum smoothness. Aside from refresh rate, OnePlus also debuted a brand new dedicated touch response chip that upgrades the response rate to 3200Hz.</p><ul><li>Call of Duty</li><li>Clash of Clans</li><li>Brawl Stars</li><li>Real Racing 3</li><li>Standoff 2</li><li>Blood Strike-FPS</li><li>Battlegrounds Mobile India</li><li>PUBG</li></ul><p>With all these settings enabled, I could clearly tell a difference in the fluidity and responsiveness of supported touchscreen games. I'm not someone who typically plays something like Call of Duty Mobile on a touchscreen — I'd rather use a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-game-controllers-android">great Android controller</a> like the GameSir Galileo G8 — but this was an impressive upgrade for people who play on touchscreen only.</p><p>Otherwise, this display uses a "typical" LTPO refresh rate schema of 1-120Hz depending on what's on screen. There is no way to force 165Hz all the time as some Motorola phones support.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-color-accuracy-and-depth"><span>Color accuracy and depth</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="sAv5ZbNCeP3Ue4eKGCunXm" name="oneplus-15-display-color" alt="Tweaking the color options on the OnePlus 15's display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sAv5ZbNCeP3Ue4eKGCunXm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The OnePlus 15 utilizes a true 10-bit OLED screen, resulting in natural-looking colors and proper HDR brightness without resorting to nasty tricks like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-users-have-had-just-about-enough-of-temporal-dithering">faking color depth with dithering</a>.</p><p>Folks wanting a more vibrant or sharper experience can use the image sharpener and video color boost features found in display options.

Samsung's Galaxy S25 Ultra still beats it in outdoor visibility due to that phone's anti-glare layer on the screen, but the OnePlus 15 is still plenty easy to see thanks to a peak 2,000 nit brightness.</p><p>Aside from this one use case — which can be solved with an anti-glare tempered glass protector — the OnePlus 15's display is as good as you'll find anywhere. It's also the most comfortable flagship phone display I've used to date, and it achieves this metric without sacrificing image quality, resolution, smoothness, or other desirable traits.

This is the first time we are witnessing an earlier-than-usual global launch, just two weeks after its initial debut in China.</p><p>The OnePlus 15 evidently looks nothing like its predecessor; it ditches the unique circular camera bump on its rear panel for a more iPhone-esque camera array, off to the left of the device. The phone features an aluminum frame with a ceramic-like feel, including completely flat edges, unlike the slightly curved <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13.</a></p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1899px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.04%;"><img id="AFkUB6s7UkfPJx9putb4cg" name="OnePlus 15-US-launch" alt="OnePlus 15 launches in the US" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v2/t:155,l:0,cw:1899,ch:1068,q:80/AFkUB6s7UkfPJx9putb4cg.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1899" height="1425" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Under the hood, the OnePlus 15 gets the all-new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-confirms-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chipset</a>, which is said to give the phone unmatched app launch speeds while keeping multitasking smooth on the device and backing its advanced AI capabilities.

This includes a 50MP main camera (with a larger sensor than its predecessor and OIS), a 50MP ultra wide camera, and a 50MP periscope telephoto lens that offers 3.5x optical zoom and OIS. It also has a 32MP selfie camera, which is said to capture 60% more light, which means you won't have a problem clicking those low-light selfies.</p><p>The OnePlus 15 now features the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-shift-from-hasselblad-official-debuts-detailmax-engine">DetailMax imaging</a> engine, which is said to enhance picture quality.

Debuting a full two months earlier than the traditional annual release schedule, the OnePlus 15 introduces a radical new design, a faster-than-ever processor, and a promise to deliver the need for speed in every regard.</p><p>However, I can't help but feel that OnePlus lost its way a bit this year. The design mirrors the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-13s-review">OnePlus 13S</a>, a phone we called "The compact iPhone clone you never wanted." OxygenOS looks and feels more like iOS than ever out of the box — though you can change all of it, thankfully — and a handful of annoying bugs make the phone feel at least somewhat unfinished.</p><p>Additionally, the trademark Alert Slider is no longer available, replaced by a generic button that can be somewhat customized, although its usage is far more limited than it should be.</p><p>At least OnePlus is still owning the company's well-known smoothness and speed mantras, featuring the best battery life I've seen on any flagship phone to date, a gorgeous 165Hz OLED that beats everything I've tested so far, and a camera with surprisingly fantastic performance despite a hardware downgrade.</p><figure class="van-image-figure pull-left inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:661px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:29.95%;"><img id="shw6vroRiUxqcvWLRPZjB6" name="click-to-follow-ac-lloyd-sq-g" alt="Click to Follow Android Central on Google" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/shw6vroRiUxqcvWLRPZjB6.jpg" mos="" align="left" fullscreen="" width="661" height="198" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-left"></p></div></div></figure><p>Enjoy our content?

Preorder customers will receive a free bonus item and can choose from a OnePlus Watch 3 43mm, OnePlus Buds Pro 3, OnePlus AIRVOOC 50W Magnetic Charger, or a OnePlus 15 Phone Case, while supplies last, when ordering from OnePlus.com.</p><p>OnePlus is stepping up its preorder game this time, with deals like cashback bonuses and offers for any phone in any condition. Once U.S. availability is announced, the OnePlus 15 will be available at OnePlus.com, Amazon, and Best Buy.

While it's certainly got a starkly "clean" look to it, OnePlus lost too much of its identity by following iPhone design language.

In the end, I reverted it to a way to toggle between ring/vibrate/silent modes with a long press, but I wish OnePlus had left the Alert Slider alone.

using a smaller sensor, the telephoto performance is quite admirable, delivering image quality that rivals iPhone, Galaxy, and Pixel phones at most zoom levels. It's really only beyond 30x or in some rare conditions that I saw the OnePplus 15 falter, and phones like the Galaxy S25 Ultra or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-magic-8-pro-hands-on">Honor Magic 8 Pro</a> deliver better results.</p><p>And while the new DetailMax engine does a better job of delivering even wider dynamic range, better colors, and sharper details than the OnePlus 13's more advanced sensors, the older sensors in the OnePlus 15 take longer to capture photos when lighting conditions are tough. We're talking 1-2 seconds longer for darker scenes, which isn't the end of the world, but it's certainly a worse experience.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-15-the-competition"><span>OnePlus 15: The competition</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="dQh26iydETxMTs6Ma7UJwQ" name="oneplus-15-vs-oneplus-13-camera-modules-02" alt="Comparing the backs of the Sand Storm OnePlus 15 with the Ocean Blue OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dQh26iydETxMTs6Ma7UJwQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The OnePlus 15 features the fastest processor, the fastest charging, the best battery life, the best OLED, and the best ingress protection rating of any flagship phone you'll find today.

Now, as we head into 2026 in just under two months, Motorola has finally unveiled the 2026 Moto G Play, bringing some welcome upgrades while keeping the phone at an extremely affordable price.</p><p>The phone features a better chip, display, and battery specifications than its predecessor, all of which sound promising on paper. That said, the cost of that affordability comes in the form of some compromises, which are front and center on this phone. After all, this is still a $179 phone, so you can't expect the very best.</p><p>So, what can you expect from a phone that costs less than $200? Well, not much, but that's really the point. You're getting what you pay for, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. It's still quite functional and can handle the basics (with a couple of extras)... so long as you're patient.</p><figure class="van-image-figure pull-left inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:661px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:29.95%;"><img id="shw6vroRiUxqcvWLRPZjB6" name="click-to-follow-ac-lloyd-sq-g" alt="Click to Follow Android Central on Google" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/shw6vroRiUxqcvWLRPZjB6.jpg" mos="" align="left" fullscreen="" width="661" height="198" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-left"></p></div></div></figure><p>Enjoy our content?

To be honest, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-play-2023-review">I wasn't too impressed</a> with what Motorola provided, so I approached this review with some apprehension. Fortunately, I can say that my time with the Moto G Play 2026 hasn't been a terrible experience.</p><p>Part of this is a result of the upgrades Motorola introduced with the 2026 model. The MediaTek Dimensity 6300 chipset is the very same one that powers the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-power-2025-review">Moto G Power 2025</a>. It's a chipset that worked quite well on that phone, and here it at least makes the performance more manageable than the last Play I reviewed. It also brings 5G connectivity, which is surprisingly a first for the Play series, and a welcome spec for a $179 phone in the year of our lord 2025.</p><p>The display also got a bump to a 120Hz refresh rate. Unfortunately, the resolution is still just HD+, but that has rarely been a concern for me in my use, and I feel like the smoother refresh rate makes up for it. You'll still have to deal with rather large bezels, but the LCD panel is bright enough at 1,000 nits.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="Che6rUQMREhe5fGGqz98Nj" name="Moto-G-Play-2026-review-6" alt="Moto G Play 2026 display outdoors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Che6rUQMREhe5fGGqz98Nj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of the standout features of the Moto G Play 2026 is its impressive battery life.

In fact, I average about nine hours of screen-on time, which is something I can't claim with too many phones.</p><p>On the software front, the phone runs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-review">Android 16</a> out of the box.

Apps don't open as fast, and there can be quite a bit of lag, so you may have to wait half a second or so to get any sort of response. This also applies to gaming, which is not this phone's strong suit.</p><p>In fact, this is probably the first time I've recommended keeping the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ram-boost-explained">RAM Boost</a> feature on. It's not a magical remedy that turns the Play into a flagship, but it does appear to help even a little bit when it comes to performance.</p><p>Unfortunately, even if you want to play games on your phone, you may need to invest in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-micro-sd-card-android">microSD card</a>. Setting up the phone nearly filled up the 64GB of internal storage, some of which is taken up by the Android software. I couldn't play Honkai: Star Rail due to the enormous storage requirements after downloading the app resources.</p><p>Still, Pokémon Go plays relatively well if you can manage the lag.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="dBrq7goqKFS9yxuL7yxZCU" name="Moto-G-Play-2026-review-10" alt="Moto G Play 2026 RAM Boost" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dBrq7goqKFS9yxuL7yxZCU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As far as software goes, the Moto G Play 2026 is in a somewhat favorable position, as it already runs Android 16, before most of Motorola's phones have even received the update. That said, even with the phone's slightly better software promise of two OS upgrades and three years of security updates, it still falls behind other cheap Android phones, particularly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/cheapest-samsung-phones-you-can-buy-today">those from Samsung</a>.</p><p>On the downside, this cheap phone comes preloaded with its fair share of bloatware, some of which is optional. I had to uninstall a few apps after the initial setup and disable a gaming folder (which is really just a way to serve ads for games you can install). The Glance lock screen is here, too, although it wasn't enabled by default, which I appreciated.</p><p>Additionally, the phone is also inexplicably missing some of my favorite software gestures. The sidebar is one of the first features I set up on any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> that has it, but for some reason, it's not present here.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="WLCkNfC9MkBfDxvxD5LZPj" name="Moto-G-Play-2026-review-1" alt="Moto G Play 2026 charging via a portable Anker charger" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WLCkNfC9MkBfDxvxD5LZPj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Charging speed is another area where the Moto G Play 2026 hasn't really evolved much, unfortunately. While the previous model features 15W charging, the 2026 model only supports 18W. That wouldn't be a huge problem, except for the increased battery capacity, meaning that it takes nearly two hours to charge the phone and roughly an hour just to reach 50%.</p><h2 id="should-you-buy-the-moto-g-play-2026-2">Should you buy the Moto G Play 2026?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="6DpXiRQnBF96fSp6NEY2Zk" name="Moto-G-Play-2026-review-7" alt="Moto G Play 2026 vegan leather back" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6DpXiRQnBF96fSp6NEY2Zk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Despite its downsides, the Moto G Play 2026 has some redeeming qualities. The vegan leather back provides a nice finish that you don't have to worry about breaking, the battery life is more than enough for most people, and the inclusion of 5G means this phone is already a step up from its predecessor.</p><p>That said, you would have to tolerate occasionally laggy performance, a subpar camera, and charging that's slower than molasses in an igloo. If you can't manage, consider other options for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones-under-200">Android phones under $200</a>, particularly older models that may perform just as well or better.</p><p>The Moto G Play 2026 doesn't feel like a bad phone; it just feels like a $179 phone. In that sense, you're getting exactly what you pay for, meaning you take the good with the bad. If you're looking for a temporary phone, a first phone for a young child, or a burner phone, this could be a suitable option. Just make sure you purchase a microSD card with it.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="9ce138d8-268d-4b4b-8393-fd22ffc26354">            <a href="https://www.motorola.com/us/en/p/phones/moto-g/moto-g-play-2026/pmipmja42mq" data-model-name="Moto G Play 2026" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hgnA3NaRP6aQV8ffkBGfuD.jpg' alt="Moto G Play 2026 render front and back"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class='featured__brand'>Motorola</div>                                        <div class="featured__title">Moto G Play 2026</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Cheapest way to play</strong></em></p><p>The Moto G Play 2026 brings 5G speeds and two-day battery life to an ultra-affordable price tag, complete with a comfortable vegan leather back and even a headphone jack.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-faq"><span>FAQ</span></h3><section class="article__schema-question"><h3>How many rear camera sensors does the Moto G Play 2026 have?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>While is looks like it has three camera sensors, the Moto G Play 2026 has one optical 32MP sensor and an ambient light sensor.</p></article></section><section class="article__schema-question"><h3>Is the Moto G Play 2026 waterproof?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>The Moto G Play 2026 isn't waterproof, but it has minimal water resistance, thanks to the IP52 rating.

However, these tests don't tend to be indicative of real-world use as they're performed on reference devices optimized to get the best scores, so I wanted to wait and see if there's any noticeable difference on consumer-facing devices powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</a>.</p><p>Although there was a little bit of a wait, I've managed to do just that, thanks to the Redmagic 11 Pro. The phone is among the initial wave of devices featuring the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, the phone serves as a good indicator as to just what the Qualcomm chipset is capable of, and after a week of testing and daily use, it's evident that this is the fastest mobile chipset available today.</p><p>And while I'm sharing testing data of the Redmagic 11 Pro, that isn't the only device based on Qualcomm's latest silicon I have on hand — there are two other phones I've been using alongside it, but as they're yet to launch, I can't talk about them just yet. Suffice to say that their performance is also in line with that of the Redmagic 11 Pro, with no measurable variance in synthetic workloads.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Redmagic 11 Pro</p></th><th  ><p>Vivo X300 Pro</p></th><th  ><p>Redmagic 10S Pro</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Geekbench 6 (single-core)</strong></p></td><td  ><p>3614</p></td><td  ><p>3391</p></td><td  ><p>3133</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Geekbench 6 (multi-core)</strong></p></td><td  ><p>10785</p></td><td  ><p>10085</p></td><td  ><p>9479</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>3DMark Wild Life Extreme (score)</strong></p></td><td  ><p>7105</p></td><td  ><p>6546</p></td><td  ><p>6954</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>3DMark Wild Life Extreme (FPS)</p></td><td  ><p>42.55</p></td><td  ><p>39.2</p></td><td  ><p>41.64</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>3DMark Solar Bay (score)</strong></p></td><td  ><p>13449</p></td><td  ><p>13588</p></td><td  ><p>12379</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>3DMark Solar Bay (FPS)</p></td><td  ><p>51.14</p></td><td  ><p>51.67</p></td><td  ><p>47.07</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Looking at Geekbench 6 single-core scores, the Redmagic 11 Pro is 13% faster than its predecessor, and there's a 9% increase in multi-core scores. There's a smaller year-on-year increase in 3DMark scores, but again, it is in line with the gains Qualcomm has delivered with every new generation over the last three years.</p><p>Interestingly, there's just a 5% difference between the Redmagic 11 Pro and the MediaTek Dimensity 9500-powered <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x300-pro-review">Vivo X300 Pro</a>, and that alone illustrates just how good the latest Arm cores are this year — they're able to hold their own against Qualcomm's custom design. It's a similar situation with 3DMark, and the ray tracing enabled Solay Bay test has both the Redmagic 11 Pro and Vivo X300 Pro on a level playing field.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4037px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.70%;"><img id="rcJq6g3FrXH6vabXiVUcvD" name="Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5" alt="Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 on a table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rcJq6g3FrXH6vabXiVUcvD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4037" height="2289" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>But there's a problem: overheating. The Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 manages to get hotter than the Snapdragon 8 Elite, which I didn't think was possible. The difference is noticeable while gaming, and even on a phone with liquid cooling like the Redmagic 11 Pro, the thermals got so high that it was just uncomfortable to hold the device.</p><p>In fact, the Redmagic 11 Pro just shut down in the middle of 3DMark's Steel Nomad Light stress test as it overheated, and this is with the built-in fan running at its highest setting and liquid cooling active. I noticed the same thing on another Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5-powered device I'm testing, so this is clearly something Qualcomm needs to look into.</p><p>While the issue isn't as extreme in regular gaming scenarios, the Redmagic 11 Pro exceeds 52 degrees in extended gaming, and it got a few degrees hotter than its predecessor. To put that into context, I didn't see any of these issues with the Vivo X300 Pro, with the device staying under 45 degrees during marathon gaming sessions.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="rCriBuxGPiceGQR68GGa8V" name="Redmagic 11 Pro" alt="Redmagic 11 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rCriBuxGPiceGQR68GGa8V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The solution? Most Android manufacturers will likely have a much more conversative thermal threshold that throttles the Qualcomm silicon before it can overheat. This is what I noticed in most 2025 phones powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite, and there really isn't much more that can be done to manage the thermals.</p><p>Even in phones with dedicated thermal management systems, there just isn't enough surface area to effectively spread out the heat generated by the chipset, so all manufacturers resort to some level of throttling. It's almost a given that we will see the same in 2026 flagships — at least those powered by Qualcomm.</p><p>So while Qualcomm once again has the fastest mobile chipset, it's a Pyrrhic victory. The overheating issue curtails the excitement associated with the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, and if anything, the Dimensity 9500 is looking like a much more balanced platform this time.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Apple Watches have 5G connectivity, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4-review">Pixel Watch 4</a> LTE has satellite SOS support; Samsung's upside is that it typically charges half as much as its rivals for the cellular upgrade.</p><p>Right now, you can essentially get the 4G LTE upgrade for the Watch 8 Classic for "free." On Amazon, the standard Bluetooth Watch 8 Classic is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Rotating-Coaching/dp/B0F7Q5RB96">$469</a> ($30 off), while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Rotating-Coaching/dp/B0F7PXV6LS"><strong>Watch 8 Classic LTE is </strong><em><strong>also</strong></em><strong> $469 ($80 off)</strong></a>, an all-time low according to Camelcamelcamel.</p><p>You'll find a similar <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Smartwatch-Titanium-Advanced-Coaching/dp/B0F7PYZ44K">$80-off</a> discount on the Galaxy Watch Ultra (2025), which includes LTE, if you're willing to spend another $100 for a titanium case and longer battery life for cellular tasks. But the Classic is the more affordable option, with better controls and similar perks.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="12b8100f-8cd9-4b1d-9c32-781a23d4bb95" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Galaxy Watch 8 Classic" data-dimension48="Galaxy Watch 8 Classic" data-dimension25="$469.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Smartwatch-Rotating-Coaching-Warranty/dp/B0F7PXV6LS" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1663px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="Mg4S8RRy6Xjk2kULqjLYiC" name="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic cropped render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Mg4S8RRy6Xjk2kULqjLYiC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1663" height="1663" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic-review" data-dimension112="12b8100f-8cd9-4b1d-9c32-781a23d4bb95" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Galaxy Watch 8 Classic" data-dimension48="Galaxy Watch 8 Classic" data-dimension25="$469.99">Galaxy Watch 8 Classic</a> has the most striking design of Samsung's 2025 watches, with a rotating steel bezel that's more exact for One UI Watch navigation than the normal Watch 8's touch bezel.

The only real question for Android phone owners is if the Pixel Watch 4 LTE is a better fit.</p><p>Our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/google-pixel-watch-4-vs-samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic">Pixel Watch 4 vs. Galaxy Watch 8 Classic guide</a> offers an in-depth comparison, but the gist is that Google's watch is less rugged, heavy, and "classically" styled, with a crown instead of a bezel. Both have Wear OS 6, but Google's stock version focuses more on stylish transitions and magnified content at the center of the domed display.  It performed surprisingly well in our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4-battery-test">LTE battery life tests</a>, and the emergency SOS feature is a nice bonus.</p><p>The Pixel Watch 4 LTE costs about the same as this Galaxy Watch 8 Classic deal, but we'd recommend the more expensive 45mm option, which is $499 at full price. So if you'd prefer Google's option, you may want to wait until Black Friday for its first major discount.</p><h2 id="more-black-friday-2025-quick-links-17">More Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong><br></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><em><strong>Black Friday Samsung Galaxy deals</strong></em></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><em><strong>Black Friday Google Pixel deals</strong></em></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><em><strong>Black Friday Motorola deals</strong></em></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Video generation models aren't new. Artificial intelligence has been able to create realistic video content for a while, and consumer tools are readily available. Both Google and OpenAI have released Veo and Sora text-to-video and image-to-video generation models in the past. So, why is the technology only blowing up now with the launch of OpenAI's Sora app?</p><p>For those unfamiliar, Sora is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/best-android-ai-apps">AI video-generation app</a> from OpenAI that combines a generator and social platform in one. It launched for iOS and on the web in September and<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/sora-app-on-android-now-available"> recently debuted for Android</a>. Chances are, even if you haven't heard of Sora, you've probably seen a video from it shared on another platform, like X or TikTok.</p><p>Sora is on its way to becoming a household name for OpenAI in the same way ChatGPT did two years ago. It's succeeding and starting to infiltrate pop culture in a way Google's Veo video-generation models haven't. After trying both Veo 3 and Sora 2, it's clear that OpenAI is winning the generative video race by going all-in on presentation — and removing as many limitations as possible.</p><h2 id="veo-3-and-sora-2-are-both-hyper-realistic-video-generation-models-2">Veo 3 and Sora 2 are both hyper-realistic video generation models</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8frHjNfcAY7re76LitBndd" name="Veo-3-vs-Sora-2" alt="The start pages for Gemini (Veo 3) and Sora." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8frHjNfcAY7re76LitBndd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>AI video generation models like Veo 3 and Sora 2 face an uphill battle. Simply making an excellent, hyper-realistic video generator isn't enough to be successful. Brands like Google and OpenAI need to make AI videos <em>cool</em>, and I wasn't sure that was possible until the Sora app launched.</p><p>By wrapping the Sora 2 model in a TikTok-like social feed and adding human cameos, OpenAI seemingly changed the perception of AI content overnight — what was once slop and garbage became funny and engaging. That has nothing to do with the model itself, but rather, the interface.</p><p>Sora, like Gemini, is both a model and an interface. Sora 2 is the video-generation model powering the experience, and OpenAI <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://openai.com/index/sora-2/" target="_blank">says</a> it is "more physically accurate, realistic, and more controllable than prior systems." The company adds that it thinks Sora 2 "may be the GPT‑3.5 moment for video."</p><p>That sounds a lot like Google's claims regarding Veo 3.1, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-veo-steps-up-its-creativity-in-3-1-version-update-for-realism">just rolled out to the Gemini app</a> in October. Google said Veo 3.1 adds "richer audio, more narrative control, and enhanced realism." It's pretty similar to what OpenAI touted about Sora 2 a month earlier.</p><p>Why hasn't Veo 3 surged in popularity like Sora 2? It's because Google doesn't have an app to tie it all together.</p><h2 id="openai-s-sora-app-turns-ai-video-generation-into-a-social-platform-2">OpenAI's Sora app turns AI video generation into a social platform</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="cNzRcmrU9RMM8LuemU9bXd" name="Veo-3-vs-Sora-3" alt="The Sora app on iOS showing the camera feature." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cNzRcmrU9RMM8LuemU9bXd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google's Veo 3 model, while technically as capable as Sora 2, is often positioned more toward developers and businesses than the average consumer. It's accessible in the Gemini app for Google AI Pro or Ultra subscribers, and it powers <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/photos-to-video-in-google-photos-gets-veo-3-upgrade">photo-to-video generation in the Google Photos app</a>. Even those implementations are ones the user needs to seek out — they're not a major part of either app.</p><p>By comparison, Sora 2 is available at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sora.chatgpt.com" target="_blank">sora.com</a>, but OpenAI also built an entire app around it. The company noticed the vertical video and infinite scroll formats working for social media platforms like TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, and others. It responded by making the Sora app a similar hub for AI-generated videos and a place where users can make their own.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LS9x8W3WfNYXAMLKyYJiod" name="Veo-3-vs-Sora-5" alt="Trying to generate a realistic video with Gemini and Sora." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LS9x8W3WfNYXAMLKyYJiod.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A core part of the Sora experience is the cameo feature, which allows users to make realistic AI videos of themselves or others. These can eventually be shared with others via the Sora feed. The idea is that you connect with your friends on Sora, create AI cameos, and share them, so that everyone has a TikTok-like feed of clever AI content.</p><p>Comparing Veo and Sora quickly revealed that OpenAI's approach with cameos immediately separates it from the competition. At a time when many video generators are blocking the creation of AI video content about real people, OpenAI made it Sora's entire reason to exist. There <em>are </em>limitations to prevent people from using Sora irresponsibly, but they end up feeling more like detours than outright roadblocks.</p><p>Here's what OpenAI says about how people can protect their likeness within Sora:</p><div><blockquote><p>Only you decide who can use your cameo, and you can revoke access or remove any video that includes it at any time. Videos containing cameos of you, including drafts created by other people, are viewable by you at any time.</p><p>OpenAI</p></blockquote></div><p>Still, these are looser restrictions than what you'll find using Veo 3 with Gemini. People are unsurprisingly always trying to find ways around them, too.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="pcDKqmTuoJiqt5rqzT8vJd" name="Veo-3-vs-Sora-6" alt="Gemini refusing to generate a video of Mark Cuban, while Sora encouraging it." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pcDKqmTuoJiqt5rqzT8vJd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While testing Veo 3 and Sora, I struggled to get Gemini to create anything realistic involving actual people or celebrities. Gemini would say, "I can't generate that video," and link to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gemini.google/policy-guidelines/?_gl=1*jixrez*_gcl_au*MTExNTgxNDcxMS4xNzYyODYzMzU2*_ga*MTkzMTQ0Mjc5OC4xNzYyODYzMzU3*_ga_WC57KJ50ZZ*czE3NjI4NjMzNTckbzEkZzEkdDE3NjI4NjMzNjMkajU0JGwwJGgw" target="_blank">video policy guidelines</a>. Oddly enough, there's nothing in there that specifically bars generating videos of real people, but Gemini and Veo models are clearly trained against it.</p><p>This puts Google and Veo 3 in a precarious position because Sora's popularity proves people crave realistic AI videos of actual people.</p><h2 id="are-google-s-strict-policy-guardrails-holding-its-ai-features-back-2">Are Google's strict policy guardrails holding its AI features back? </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="35LBckLVTZJUkZ5BUEBtwd" name="Veo-3-vs-Sora-4" alt="The Sora app on iOS showing its AI content advisory." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/35LBckLVTZJUkZ5BUEBtwd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>OpenAI's headfirst dive into lifelike AI videos represents a sharp contrast to Google's insistence on AI responsibility. I can't say for certain why OpenAI is starting to bend the lines, but after following the AI industry closely for years, I have a theory — AI development is plateauing, and OpenAI's competitors are catching up.</p><p>Shortly after announcing Sora, OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, said in October 2025 that ChatGPT would soon be allowed to engage in "erotica for verified adults" (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apnews.com/article/ai-erotica-chatgpt-openai-sam-altman-d52e00cedf34a8120af7af66981da295" target="_blank">AP</a>). Altman added that OpenAI is "not the elected moral police of the world."</p><p>These are separate decisions, but as a whole, they appear to show OpenAI systematically removing guardrails for its AI products. By letting Sora go all-in on AI videos of real people, OpenAI created an instant hit. Meanwhile, Veo is still relatively unknown to the masses.</p><p>To me, AI videos are still slop, regardless of whether Veo or Sora makes them. Who knows if OpenAI's bet on Sora, social, and cameos will pay off? But for now, it's hard to argue with early results — the Sora app has already been downloaded millions of times across iOS and Android.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-faq"><span>FAQ</span></h2><section class="article__schema-question"><h3>What is Google Veo?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>Veo is a text-to-video model developed by Google that enables users to create high-quality, realistic short video clips based on text prompts.

The Even G2 is an evolution of the brand’s first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">smart glasses</a>, now incorporating new optics, smarter AI, and a more comfortable fit.</p><p>Inside is Even HAO 2.0, a redesigned optical engine using micro-LED projectors and layered waveguides to project crisp visuals that look like they’re naturally part of your world rather than floating text on a lens. It can also display info on multiple visual layers, so quick AI prompts appear in the foreground while navigation or notes sit subtly behind them.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.70%;"><img id="3j2mkGWzFUoy45RJYwwvj3" name="Even-G2-smart-glasses" alt="Even G2 smart glasses close up" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3j2mkGWzFUoy45RJYwwvj3.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1366" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Even Realities)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.70%;"><img id="Kars7boG6NfJpSx4ubsSMn" name="Even-G2-smart-glasses" alt="Even G2 smart glasses and R1 ring on a lap" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Kars7boG6NfJpSx4ubsSMn.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1366" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Even Realities)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:64.36%;"><img id="jrD6JJnVqgszDCPd3ctQ5k" name="Even-G2-smart-glasses" alt="Even G2 smart glasses on the face" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jrD6JJnVqgszDCPd3ctQ5k.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1318" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Even Realities)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Unlike many smart glasses, the G2 skips cameras and speakers entirely, so there's no recording or unwanted audio. It is built with aerospace-grade titanium and magnesium alloy to keep it featherweight at 36 grams, with IP67 dust and water resistance. Battery life lasts over two days on one charge, and the compact case offers seven full recharges.</p><p>On the software side, G2 introduces Conversate, a feature that listens to conversations (with your consent) and helps you keep up with topics, context, and follow-ups. The glasses also refine popular tools like Teleprompt, Translate (supporting 29 languages), and Navigate, now with a built-in geomagnetic sensor for better orientation.</p><h2 id="control-on-your-finger-2">Control on your finger</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SCAsDrxeboEfT4inVE7bkD" name="Even-R1-smart-ring" alt="Even R1 smart ring" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SCAsDrxeboEfT4inVE7bkD.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Even Realities)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XBACSycPfgv4o8dpQt3LZD" name="Even-R1-smart-ring" alt="Even R1 smart ring" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XBACSycPfgv4o8dpQt3LZD.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Even Realities)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Then there’s the new Even R1 Smart Ring, which doubles as a discreet controller for the G2 and a health tracker.

IT will also run Android 16 out of the box, which is a given at this point.

The reason behind this is unknown at the moment, but it means you will not be able to use this feature even if you have last year's Pixel 9 or previous Pixel 8 or Pixel 7 models.</p><h2 id="a-battery-friendly-maps-mode-you-probably-can-t-use-2">A battery-friendly Maps mode you probably can't use</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="25kXR7jBzszajx2d7YmYg9" name="google-maps-psv" alt="Google Maps' power-saving mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/25kXR7jBzszajx2d7YmYg9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Moreover, as noted by a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/16711572">Google Support page</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-maps-power-saving-mode-pixel-10-3614181/">Android Authority</a>), this feature works only while in driving navigation mode on the Pixel 10 series. It does not support other types of navigation, such as walking or biking directions.</p><p>It is disappointing that Google is keeping this feature exclusive to the Pixel 10 series. Though it is likely because the new Power Saving Mode in Google Maps uses a feature called "AOD Min Mode" that allows apps to tap into Android's Always-on Display to show apps as full-screen activities while consuming less power with dim brightness, fewer colors, and a lower refresh rate.</p><p>This feature is a part of Android, and any app can use it, but Google has decided to make the feature unavailable on older Pixel phones. Though similar to other Pixel-exclusive features, it may arrive on other Pixel phones in the future.</p><p>That said, if you have the latest Pixel 10 series phone, you will be able to use this feature once it rolls out widely. To access it, just press the power button during navigation to start the new Power Saving Mode in Maps and view navigation in the new always-on display style instead of the usual clock and lock screen.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It is available for recent Pixel phones, including the Pixel 6, 6 Pro, the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-series-your-ultimate-guide">Pixel 10</a> series, and foldables.</p><p>The latest beta release is still on the October 2025 security patch, which shows Google is focusing on stability rather than new system-level features this time.</p><p>As you may already know, QPR (Quarterly Platform Release) updates usually include small refinements before a stable public release, and this point update is no different. Beta 3.3’s changelog lists a fix for a lock-screen issue where devices could freeze or become unresponsive after waking.</p><h2 id="squashes-a-major-lock-screen-freeze-2">Squashes a major lock-screen freeze</h2><p>The bug (Issue #457527675) has caused random freezes that required users to restart their phones to fix, so many Pixel owners will be glad it’s resolved. Earlier beta versions, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-rolls-out-bootloader-fix-in-android-16-qpr2-beta-3-1">Android 16 Beta 3.1</a>, also fixed bootloop issues for Pixel users.</p><p>As this is primarily a stability update with one critical bug fix, users shouldn’t expect visual or functional overhauls. That said, those enrolled in the Android Beta Program can grab the over-the-air (OTA) update starting today.</p><p>The rollout should gradually make its way to all eligible <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/best-google-pixel-phones">Pixel phones</a>, though users can head over to Settings > System > Software update to check for it. If you haven’t enrolled in the beta program yet, Google’s beta site still offers an easy sign-up process. Just keep in mind that beta software can occasionally introduce minor quirks.</p><p>While Android 16’s QPR2 Beta 3.3 might not look exciting on paper, it brings us a step closer to the full release expected later this year, possibly in December. If you’ve been dealing with lock-screen glitches or random slowdowns, installing this update should make your Pixel feel noticeably smoother.</p> ]]></dc:content>

However, that showcase was limited, with the device displayed behind glass and no media or attendees allowed to go hands-on. Samsung also did not reveal any additional details about the device at the conference.

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I'm enjoying using ColorOS 16; while it feels like a facsimile of iOS 26, the UI is modern, has good optimization, and it is fluid. There are plenty of new features as well, and one that I like is the new app drawer. It doesn't look any different to previous years — other than a search bar located at the bottom — but it has new a few new tricks.</p><p>You get the usual alphabetized sorting in the app drawer, but this time when you tap on a letter, it pulls up all the apps starting with that letter without you having to scroll down to that section. This makes launching apps that much easier, and is just a nice addition. I now find myself just using this option instead of scrolling the app drawer, and it's even faster than using the search bar.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="X8KaRyzK2dkKhMruhiUYzM" name="ColorOS 16 on Find X9 Pro" alt="ColorOS 16 on Find X9 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/X8KaRyzK2dkKhMruhiUYzM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another plus point is that when you launch an app this way and exit it, you'll go to the home screen. That isn't the case when you scroll down the app drawer and launch an app; in this situation, you go back to that position within the drawer when you exit the app. OPPO introduced this with ColorOS 15, and after a year of use, I still don't like it. Thankfully, with the easier way to sort and launch apps, this hasn't proved to be a problem on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/oppo-find-x9-pro-review">Find X9 Pro</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="LveFHA2LzFx5jQC9GUrQEN" name="ColorOS 16 on Find X9 Pro" alt="ColorOS 16 on Find X9 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LveFHA2LzFx5jQC9GUrQEN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Alongside the feature, ColorOS 16 has auto-categorization of apps. Xiaomi did this on its phones for several years, but with ColorOS 16, OPPO is emulating iOS, offering identical functionality. Basically, apps are sorted into folders automatically, and you can then drag these folders around as needed. Thankfully, this exists as a standalone pane called Categories, and if you don't like the feature, you don't need to use it at all.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="BnZp5sCogNEy4oYRwPMN6N" name="ColorOS 16 on Find X9 Pro" alt="ColorOS 16 on Find X9 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BnZp5sCogNEy4oYRwPMN6N.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I get that tweaking the app drawer is a minor thing, but it makes a noticeable difference in daily use. It is particularly evident when going back to a Pixel; I recently tested the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/the-pixel-10-pro-fold-may-not-be-the-best-foldable-but-its-the-one-i-like-the-most">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a>, and using the app drawer on the foldable feels archaic — Google doesn't even have alphabetized sorting. Yes, I know it can be triggered by pressing down on the scroll bar, but it is usually a hassle, and it isn't anywhere as smooth or convenient to use as OPPO's implementation within ColorOS 16.</p><p>It's clear that Android brands are paying greater attention to what their rivals are doing — you'll just need to see the design similarities between Vivo's OriginOS 6, Xiaomi's software, and ColorOS 16 to know that — and I want other Android manufacturers to steal ColorOS 16's app drawer and integrate it into their own devices.</p> ]]></dc:content>

That's the question long-time Garmin fans may have to answer soon, based on a report suggesting that "ongoing Garmin hardware work" is in progress toward a rotating crown with a magnetic sensor.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gadgetsandwearables.com/2025/11/09/garmin-rotating-crown/">Gadgets & Wearables</a> shared this news, explaining that the Hall effect sensor wouldn't rely on mechanical parts or a physical connection, making it easier for Garmin to preserve its watches' water resistance. For context, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic-review">Galaxy Watch 8 Classic</a> uses a Hall sensor for its rotating crown.</p><p>Garmin's main fitness and smartwatch rivals have used crowns for years, which made Garmin's button-heavy designs a point of pride and comfort for its fans. They're slower to press but more dependable than sweaty touchscreen swipes, without the finicky accidental turns you get when a crown bumps into something; they're also more accessible for left-handed athletes.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HFDdUzCEvCKoxe3Mdccmwe" name="Garmin-watch-with-rotating-crown.jpg" alt="A mockup render of a Garmin watch showing a rotating crown embedded into a rugged design." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HFDdUzCEvCKoxe3Mdccmwe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Gadgets & Wearables)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The alleged design would sport two left-side buttons and a single right-side crown. Assuming the above mockup is accurate, it would be similar to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4-review">Pixel Watch 4</a>'s or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/suunto-race-2-hands-on-accuracy-test">Suunto Race 2</a>'s centered crown, rather than the top-right placement you get on a COROS or Apple Watch.</p><p>There are dozens of Garmin watch subbrands, and even if this report is accurate, there's no guarantee Garmin will ditch Up/ Down buttons on its Fenix, Forerunner, or Instinct watches. Garmin may only use them on its "mainstream" lineups, aka updating the two-button <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-venu-4-fitness-heart-rate-steps">Venu 4</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-vivoactive-6-review">Vivoactive 6</a> with crowns.</p><p>On the other hand, we've seen how AMOLED displays started with the Venu series and then took over <em>most</em> Garmin watches over the past few years, despite the outcry from MIP display fans who took pride in Garmin's use of this less-popular tech.</p><p>The MIP vs. AMOLED debate had passionate athletes on both sides, whereas I'm not certain how many Garmin watch fans have been clamoring for a crown. If this report proves accurate, we may see our first Garmin watch with a crown relatively soon; the reaction will depend on <em>which</em> lineup gets the crown.</p><h2 id="the-main-thing-a-garmin-watch-with-a-crown-would-need-2">The main thing a Garmin watch with a crown would need</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="d9sAsGozfYqTxRFHAQC9fM" name="COROS-APEX-4-turn-by-turn-navigation" alt="A photo of the COROS APEX 4 on the author's wrist showing a topographic map with turn-by-turn navigation showing a right turn in 387 feet." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/d9sAsGozfYqTxRFHAQC9fM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Putting a crown on a Garmin watch would have <em>some</em> upsides. When it comes to map navigation, I prefer COROS watches because zooming in and out is significantly easier with a crown than with buttons. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-nomad-3-has-impressed-me-as-fun-garmin-instinct-3-rival">COROS NOMAD</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-apex-4-fitness-test-and-first-impressions">APEX 4</a> are excellent hiking companions, whether I'm following a route or just checking what trails are nearby.</p><p>Of course, only premium Garmin models like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Fenix 8</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-970-review">Forerunner 970</a> even <em>have</em> maps, and hardcore Garmin/ button fans are the most likely to buy these. If the Garmin Fenix 9 introduces the crown next year, that could be a big risk, considering Garmin's stock took a big hit because, among other things, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-pro-vs-fenix-8">Fenix 8 Pro</a> sales were lower than anticipated.</p><p>Let's assume Garmin <em>does</em> give its flagship watches a crown. I think it would only work if Garmin accompanied it with a significant processor or memory boost. Garmin watches, packed with features while optimized for long battery life, have felt a bit <em>laggy</em> this generation, especially when scrolling through maps, and speedier crown scrolling would expose this.</p><p>Ideally, Garmin would take this opportunity to boost performance a bit, while maintaining the same battery life that Garmin fans expect.</p><h2 id="why-garmin-might-go-down-this-route-2">Why Garmin might go down this route</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ikzBFsdFCJgjTtP7VBhkAn" name="Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-Garmin-Fenix-8-run-activities" alt="The Garmin Fenix 8 and Apple Watch Ultra 2, both showing Run activity start screens." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ikzBFsdFCJgjTtP7VBhkAn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As a runner in a warm-climate area, I don't have the same issues with a crown as other athletes will. Turning a crown is harder with gloves in cold-weather regions, and if it juts out too far, it can interfere with certain bodyweight or gym exercises. Even if buttons are more deliberate to press, they're a safer choice, one Garmin has relied on for a decade.</p><p>So why would Garmin ignore your likely ambivalence to a crown? Because Garmin already <em>has</em> your business. It needs to satisfy shareholders by continuing to grow its audience, stealing them away from Apple and Samsung. And quite simply, those users might be more comfortable with a crown than buttons. It's the same reason AMOLED displays have become the norm.</p><p>We shouldn't get too riled up by a single unconfirmed report, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watches</a> may stick to five-button layouts for years to come. But the report is plausible, and it wouldn't shock me if we see our first Garmin crown in 2026.</p> ]]></dc:content>

I tested all the models in this range, starting with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-ft1-new-king-of-budget-headphones">FT1</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-ft1-pro-best-budget-planar-headphones">FT1 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-ft3-review">FT3</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-ft5-review">FT5</a>, and now the FT7. As the naming indicates, the FT7 sits at the pinnacle of the range, and the design and planar drivers indicate as much.</p><p>The FT7 is now available globally, and it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/FiiO-Headphones-Open-Back-Diaphragm-Detachable/dp/B0F2J4FKRZ/">costs $699 on Amazon U.S.</a> as of writing. Obviously, that's costlier than the $499 retail price of the FT5 and double that of the budget-focused FT3 and FT1 models, but as is always the case with Fiio, you get an incredible value.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PUkXrSg3M3PtS3P6FpQSZj" name="Fiio FT7" alt="Fiio FT7 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PUkXrSg3M3PtS3P6FpQSZj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Starting with the design, the FT7 retains a similar aesthetic as its siblings, but the design is different. The headset uses a carbon reinforced chassis, and going this route clearly made a difference to the weight, with the FT7 coming in at 427g, 29g lighter than the 456g of the FT5. Even if the numbers indicate the lightness of the headset, it feels lighter than its sizing suggests; in a sense, this is the opposite problem of what you get with Audeze's products.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="AWtUik7pSAKVp4UyKA5TZj" name="Fiio FT7" alt="Fiio FT7 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AWtUik7pSAKVp4UyKA5TZj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Build quality itself is phenomenal, and the FT7 looks every bit like a high-end headset. It is considerably bigger than the FT5, and that has to do with the size of the planar drivers. As a result, this isn't a headset you can take outside — it's designed to be used for indoor listening.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="nAozsA7ZUQeh4jw8y6fEcj" name="Fiio FT7" alt="Fiio FT7 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nAozsA7ZUQeh4jw8y6fEcj.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="iBBNLHxpj6E8uRwZGdzUZj" name="Fiio FT7" alt="Fiio FT7 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iBBNLHxpj6E8uRwZGdzUZj.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The design itself feels elegant, and the outside of the earcups is decked out in wood, and looks pretty good. The large grilles do a good job showcasing the planar drivers housed inside, and like the chassis, the headband uses a carbon construction.

The lightweight design ensures there's no fatigue even with extended use, and there isn't much in the way of clamping force. If anything, the FT7 sits snugly against your head, and you don't feel like you're wearing a headset that's quite as big as the design indicates. To give you some context, I tested the FT7 alongside Audeze's new LCD-S20, and Fiio did a better job with the comfort of the headset.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9NsKJfhV8nVZV94h8PfLbj" name="Fiio FT7" alt="Fiio FT7 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9NsKJfhV8nVZV94h8PfLbj.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ewWcfCaX6nUCRGSZLWqhXj" name="Fiio FT7" alt="Fiio FT7 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ewWcfCaX6nUCRGSZLWqhXj.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>You get leather ear pads installed by default, and Fiio also bundles fabric pads in the box. Both sets of pads have an angled design that adds to the overall comfort, and while the fabric pads have better breathability, I used the leather ones during my testing.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="aBJAXbFSD9g436vuRrtjej" name="Fiio FT7" alt="Fiio FT7 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aBJAXbFSD9g436vuRrtjej.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On that note, the bundled cable is three meters in length — double that of the FT5. I don't have any issues with the length of the cable, but I would have liked Fiio to include a smaller cable in the box. As it stands, you get just the single cable, and instead of interchangeable plugs, you get a standard 4.4mm connector with extenders that let you slot in XLR or 6.35mm plugs as needed.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="pFwiJFrniVrx47pkLAe3dj" name="Fiio FT7" alt="Fiio FT7 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pFwiJFrniVrx47pkLAe3dj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The cable itself is of a high quality, and in four months of constant use, I didn't see any issues whatsoever. The outer sheath gives it additional durability, and I have no doubt that the cable is built to last. In a similar vein, the hard shell case is among the best around, and it does a great job safeguarding the FT7 when you're not using the headset.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Pz4z2auJpv2FJuvBp8W2dj" name="Fiio FT7" alt="Fiio FT7 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Pz4z2auJpv2FJuvBp8W2dj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The FT7 has a 106mm planar driver, and the sheer size of the driver is what led to the increase in dimensions from the FT5. Interestingly, Fiio notes it used a multi-layer coating system with PET used as the diaphragm substrate, with the brand adding 24k gold and silver to it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="UTHfEA6i2r6SM99dpZRmej" name="Fiio FT7" alt="Fiio FT7 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UTHfEA6i2r6SM99dpZRmej.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What I find notable is that the diaphragm is ultra-thin at just 1µm, and that it's made on a 28nm node. Now, that may sound like ancient when phones like the Find X9 Pro use the Dimensity 9500 that's fabbed on a 3nm node, but in the context of the audio industry, it is revolutionary.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wrUoRmkBJkzCdVwaip6dYj" name="Fiio FT7" alt="Fiio FT7 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wrUoRmkBJkzCdVwaip6dYj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With 25Ω and sensitivity of 94dB/mW, you'll need a decent source to get the best out of this headset.

There's good rumble and energy, and the headset does better than the FT5 in this regard. The mids are clean and have good texture, with instrument ensembles and vocals shining through. There's good treble extension as well, particularly with the leather pads. I didn't notice any harshness, and if you want a more balanced sound, I'd suggest switching to the fabric pads.</p><p>The soundstage is incredibly expansive, and you get a level of immersion that's not often found in this category. Overall, Fiio did an outstanding job with the design and tuning of the FT7, and the pricing is thoroughly justified. If anything, I think the FT7 is the best-sounding planar headset under $1,000 right now.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="3e4be3a6-d48a-4945-86af-dd7e3eae78b5">            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/FiiO-Headphones-Open-Back-Diaphragm-Detachable/dp/B0F2J4FKRZ" data-model-name="FT7 Planar Headset" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:133.38%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gzXMJRUHSrB7gXWkKxbfJk.jpg' alt="Fiio FT7"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class='featured__brand'>Fiio</div>                                        <div class="featured__title">FT7 Planar Headset</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The FT7 sounds better than any other Fiio headset, and the soundstage is as wide as Sennheiser's HD800 models.

Now, a new leak suggests that wireless charging speeds will also get a boost.</p><p>According to a report from Korean outlet <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.etnews.com/20251111000219">ET News</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Jukanlosreve/status/1988127441794330697">@Jukanlosreve on X</a>), Samsung is planning to equip the Galaxy S26 Ultra with up to 25W fast wireless charging.

One of the most surprising offers I've seen comes from Verizon, which will give you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s25/"><strong>a free Samsung Galaxy S25, Galaxy Watch 8, AND a Galaxy Tab if you bundle the three devices</strong></a> and add respective service lines. </p><p>No trade-in is required, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-verizon-phone-deals-plans">Verizon</a> won't even force you to use the most expensive data plans to receive the savings. Even lower-priced tiers like Verizon's myPlan and the Unlimited Welcome plan will land you the three free Samsung devices, just be sure to add all three items to the same cart. Only new customers and existing Verizon customers who add a new line with a port-in are eligible for the deal, but if you can make it work for you, it's almost like getting all of your holiday shopping done at once! </p><ul><li><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><em><strong>See the full list of Black Friday deals at Verizon</strong></em></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="b266e783-390d-4816-b5d9-1e9236f21fa4" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Verizon Black Friday Bundle: Get a free Galaxy S25, Watch, and Tab with eligible service lines" data-dimension48="Verizon Black Friday Bundle: Get a free Galaxy S25, Watch, and Tab with eligible service lines" href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s25/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:502px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:106.97%;"><img id="qVDakRZaDJo6VZFZcF8dxR" name="samsung-galaxy-phone-tab-watch-bundle-render.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qVDakRZaDJo6VZFZcF8dxR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="502" height="537" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Verizon Black Friday Bundle: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s25/" data-dimension112="b266e783-390d-4816-b5d9-1e9236f21fa4" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Verizon Black Friday Bundle: Get a free Galaxy S25, Watch, and Tab with eligible service lines" data-dimension48="Verizon Black Friday Bundle: Get a free Galaxy S25, Watch, and Tab with eligible service lines" data-dimension25=""><strong>Get a free Galaxy S25, Watch, and Tab with eligible service lines</strong></a></p><p>Just in time for Black Friday, Verizon is running a deal that will get you a free <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Samsung Galaxy S25</a>, Galaxy Watch 8, AND a Samsung tablet, and all you need to do is pay for the new data plans.

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a>, for instance, is powered by the ultra-efficient Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, plus you get 12GB of RAM, seven years of software support, and all of the latest Galaxy AI software features. </p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-review">Galaxy Watch 8</a> is no slouch either, coming complete with a stylish, ultra-comfy design, Wear OS 6, and a suite of comprehensive health and fitness tracking features. Not interested in these devices? Verizon is also running similar bundle deals for Apple and Pixel, so take your pick. Needless to say, Black Friday is sure to come with a multitude of excellent Android deals in tow, but if you don't want to wait, Verizon has you covered. </p><h2 id="more-black-friday-2025-quick-links-27">More Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong><br></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><em><strong>Black Friday Samsung Galaxy deals</strong></em></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><em><strong>Black Friday Google Pixel deals</strong></em></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><em><strong>Black Friday Motorola deals</strong></em></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Make sure to <a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=androidcentral.com" target="_blank"><strong>set Android Central as a preferred source</strong></a> in Google Search, and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should"><strong>find out why you should</strong></a> so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>Google just dropped its month update for Pixels and this seems to be feature loaded. The tech giant announced that a whole host of features is coming to Pixel 6 to the Pixel 10 series.</p><p>The update brings a mix of fresh AI tools, safety upgrades, and a themed makeover inspired by Wicked. Whether you’re rocking an older Pixel or the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-fold">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a>, there’s something in here to play with.</p><p>One of the standout additions is Remix in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-first-things-to-do">Google Messages</a>, a creative new feature powered by Google’s Gemini Nano Banana model. It lets you reimagine photos inside a chat. You and your friends can pass the same image back and forth, tweaking and remixing it without ever leaving the conversation.</p><p>The feature launches first for RCS users in English-speaking countries including the U.S., UK, Canada, Australia, India, Ireland, and New Zealand.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:54.48%;"><img id="PnRxq5BeNa5uCA6jQhhxcG" name="Pixel-Drop-Google-Messages-Remix" alt="Remix in Google Messages showing a dog with various AI-generated versions" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PnRxq5BeNa5uCA6jQhhxcG.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1046" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="wicked-themed-customization-2">Wicked-themed customization</h2><p>If you're fond of customization, there’s the new “Wicked: For Good” theme pack. Available for Pixel 6 and above until January 31, 2026, it dresses your phone in Wicked-inspired wallpapers, icons, sounds, and GIFs — with themes based on Glinda, Elphaba, and For Good.</p><p>Pixel users will also get some useful quality-of-life improvements. Notification Summaries, coming to Pixel 9 and newer (except the 9a), automatically condense long group chats into quick recaps right in your notification shade. A follow-up feature arriving in December promises to take things further by automatically quieting less important alerts, helping you focus on what matters.</p><h2 id="scam-protection-gets-tougher-2">Scam protection gets tougher</h2><p>On the security front, Scam Detection for messages can now flag suspicious chat notifications in popular apps on Pixel 6 and newer models. It checks message content and shows a “Likely scam” alert before you open the app. Google is also expanding call scam detection, which listens for scam-like speech during calls, to more regions like the UK, Ireland, India, Australia, and Canada.</p><p>For Pixel 9 and newer, Call Notes is also expanding internationally. The feature uses on-device AI to record and summarize calls, turning them into searchable notes with action items, making follow-ups less of a chore.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5739jzRC6N2xzgfNPxxLpb" name="November-Pixel-Drop-features" alt="Pixel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5739jzRC6N2xzgfNPxxLpb.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ALjyZgYFrq2vCbZpgtfrfb" name="November-Pixel-Drop-features" alt="Google Maps power saving mode showing minimal interface during navigation" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ALjyZgYFrq2vCbZpgtfrfb.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:54.00%;"><img id="LiGGrojEpAFfNrzLiakDrb" name="November-Pixel-Drop-features" alt="Pixel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LiGGrojEpAFfNrzLiakDrb.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="krULDBviXgNKFpsi9PxLwb" name="November-Pixel-Drop-features" alt="Pixel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/krULDBviXgNKFpsi9PxLwb.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Google Photos is also getting Personalized Edits.

I've had a question all this time: how do you guys decide what is worth writing about? I don't mean news and updated information because that's a given. I mean, the other content about what you all like or what you think needs to change. </strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Surely you're not just writing what you want, and there has to be some sort of process. If you can share anything about it, I think it would be very interesting.</strong></em></p><p>Hi Jane, thanks for the interesting question. It's nice to step away from wires and tubes and things that go beep every now and then.</p><p>I'm going to preface this by saying this is about <strong>me</strong>. We're all writers and Android enthusiasts here at Android Central, but more importantly, we're individuals. We each have our own process of getting an idea from the back corner of our mind onto the web's virtual paper.</p><p>I'll also skip some obvious things. If there is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/news">news</a> out there, it will get written because people want to read it. The same goes for announcements from the companies that build all this stuff; when Samsung or Motorola has something to share, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">it's always worth sharing</a>.</p><p>Once we're past that part, things are a little more free-form. The most important thing to me is that <strong>we</strong> care about something (we, meaning both you, the reader, and I). I could spend all day writing about fishing poles or how to change the spark plugs on a Volkswagen, but would you read it?</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8256px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vfdeGuDnjLPcDdkqgma7YK" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-titaniumsilverblue-s25plus-navy-s25-icyblue" alt="The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, Galaxy S25 Plus, and Galaxy S25, next to each other." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vfdeGuDnjLPcDdkqgma7YK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8256" height="4644" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The second most important thing is that I have a clue. I don't write about finances, for example, because I don't follow how much companies are earning or spending, as it holds no interest to me. Anything I would write wouldn't be nearly as interesting as it would be if someone enthusiastic about the subject tackled it. We both deserve better.</p><p>Finally, some of my interests are tech-adjacent but not really a great fit for an Android website. I love DIY and project electronics, so the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/raspberry-pi">Raspberry Pi</a> is one of my favorite products. I'll occasionally share a great deal with you, but I don't have the time to spend explaining how to use it and build a smart device or a reef aquarium controller. Or even a phone. I know, because I've done it, and very few people read it.</p><p>When all the dust settles, I hope I can share some information that's interesting and helpful. Helping people is important to me.</p><h2 id="we-write-about-what-we-love-2">We write about what we love</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hiofJ5eS93tG6WTpCKssnN" name="linux-on-pixelbook-go-16x9.jpg" alt="Linux terminal on Pixelbook Go" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hiofJ5eS93tG6WTpCKssnN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Within reason, of course.</p><p>If you take a minute to notice it, you'll find that the writers here have an obvious love of different things. When the right person writes about something like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/ac-thvrsday">VR glasses</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/sunday-runday">health and fitness</a>, it shows, and the articles are exceptional.</p><p>I'm not interested in how a company is building the next generation of super microprocessor that can power things 30% faster. I'm curious about optimizing the existing software to make it more efficient and run 30% faster than it currently does. Without the software, all these gadgets are just a hunk of metal and wires.</p><p>I'm also super interested in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebooks</a>. They have the potential to do anything and everything with the right infrastructure, yet they're often dirt cheap. A powerful product that's accessible to everyone beats a $5,000 MacBook every time.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1299px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:49.96%;"><img id="VH3fnBtYZxXpXdaf4nd2KJ" name="Android-Central-columns" alt="A list of some Android Central columns" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VH3fnBtYZxXpXdaf4nd2KJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1299" height="649" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's a little off the beaten track, but I want to try to do my part in holding all these companies accountable, too. Google, Apple, Samsung, and others provide us with the products we love, often making our lives easier. But there is always a cost, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-vs-disney-when-big-companies-fight-consumers-lose">things need to be equitable</a>. If you're forced to give up more than something is worth, or when these seemingly above-the-rules tech companies are out of line, I want to mention it. And there's always plenty of that going on.</p><p>Finally, there is the whole Apple thing. "<em>Who cares about Apple? This is an Android website!</em>" is something I get to hear all of the time. Here's an answer: <strong>I care about Apple</strong>. I also care about Microsoft and Amazon. These companies are driving and shaping the future of our tech. I'll never use an iPhone; I tried it, hated it (though I think the older Mac Mini was the best PC ever). When Apple makes a change to the iPhone that affects consumers or consumer technology in general, that's important, particularly because of the sheer number of people using the product.</p><h2 id="we-re-a-service-provider-2">We're a service provider</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1067px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="rMBmQxWTmVoB7xjzPDAZkN" name="Lenovo Tab M11 lifestyle" alt="Lenovo Tab M11" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rMBmQxWTmVoB7xjzPDAZkN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1067" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Lenovo)</span></figcaption></figure><p>At the end of the day, we're here for you.

For example, buyers can get the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Moto-Stylus-Unlocked-Gibraltar/dp/B0DWV55DXH" target="_blank"><strong>Motorola Moto G Stylus for $100 off during Amazon's early Black Friday sale</strong></a> right now, bringing the price down to just under $300.</p><p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the Moto G Stylus comes with a stylus included. It also features a 6.7-inch pOLED screen, as well as both a regular and ultrawide camera lens. Like most Motorola phones, it also features the vegan leather, anti-slip backing, and the latest edition of the phone comes with a MIL-STD-810H durability rating, meaning that it's rated even for military standard durability. It also comes with an IP68 water and dust resistance rating, so it can definitely take a bit of a beating if you're looking for something particularly strong and waterproof.</p><p>This particular deal is for the 256GB storage version of the phone, while both configurations sport 8GB of RAM and a powerful Snapdragon CPU.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/moto-g-stylus-2025-vs-moto-g-stylus-5g-2024">Compared to the 2024 Moto G Stylus</a>, the 2025 comes with some key design improvements, including the aforementioned IP and durability ratings. It also boasts a slightly better suite of cameras, faster charging speeds, higher wireless standards, and some of the latest Motorola software features available. While it doesn't usually go on sale as much as the 2024 version, this is a solid price for those hoping to get a newer release.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-amazon-deals-2025" target="_blank"><strong>Check out our ultimate guide to Amazon's early Black Friday deals!</strong></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$399.99" data-dimension48="$399.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Moto-Stylus-Unlocked-Gibraltar/dp/B0DWV55DXH" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1112px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:115.83%;"><img id="8MUigJMAtb2rabW3B3tdvm" name="motorola-moto-g-stylus-2025-product-image.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8MUigJMAtb2rabW3B3tdvm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1112" height="1288" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Motorola Moto G Stylus (2025):</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Moto-Stylus-Unlocked-Gibraltar/dp/B0DWV55DXH" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$399.99" data-dimension48="$399.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$399.99</del> <strong>$299.99 at Amazon for the Early Black Friday sale</strong></a></p><p>Amazon's early Black Friday sale has cut 25% off the price of this year's Motorola Moto G Stylus, marking $100 in savings.

It also has the luxurious-feeling vegan leather back that Motorola buyers love, along with a headphone jack, a 50MP wide lens and a 13MP ultrawide, in addition to a 32MP front camera. This phone can also charge at speeds of up to 68W, in contrast with the 30W offered with the 2024 version.</p><p>Interestingly enough, Motorola only launched this year's Moto G Stylus with two vaguely blue colors, dubbed Gibraltar Sea and Surf the Web.

Sadly, this is also the case with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-review">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a>, as the camera hardware is practically identical to its predecessor.</p><p>Enjoy our content?

It's also an interesting comparison because while Google didn't really do much in the way of upgrades, Samsung took the opposite approach with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-camera-comparison">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>. However, even with the new 200MP sensor, I'm not sure that it's really all <em>that much</em> better than the Pixel 10 Pro Fold.</p><p>Right off the bat, we get the patented Samsung saturation, albeit not as pronounced as I've become accustomed to. It's saturated enough to notice compared to the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, but it's not like the picture looks bad by any means. That said, the 10 Pro Fold took a picture that was a bit more true-to-life, and a bit brighter, even if it doesn't really matter in the grand scheme.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="q8N6TsaU8w9XYXMbNMp5XA" name="pixel-10-pro-fold-vs-galaxy-z-fold-7-3" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold vs. Galaxy Z Fold 7 camera comparisons" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/q8N6TsaU8w9XYXMbNMp5XA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The picture of the tree has me feeling a bit perplexed, as the tree from the Fold 7 doesn't stand out quite as much, and it's not until you look at the grass behind the tree that you see a clear difference. To be honest, this was one of the closer pictures to judge, as both phones do a good job at capturing what I was actually seeing.</p><p>This picture below really surprised me.

Unfortunately, this is where the Galaxy Z Fold 7 fell, and fell hard. It's immediately apparent in every image, but especially so with pictures that have text in them.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="aqh2a7SzLmucmnPaS3CnDA" name="pixel-10-pro-fold-vs-galaxy-z-fold-7-2" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold vs. Galaxy Z Fold 7 camera comparisons" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aqh2a7SzLmucmnPaS3CnDA.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="gpwxciqCHjEp9F7bmqBAPA" name="pixel-10-pro-fold-vs-galaxy-z-fold-7-5" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold vs. Galaxy Z Fold 7 camera comparisons" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gpwxciqCHjEp9F7bmqBAPA.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4D7rVF9cxNBQKCP2qumTKA" name="pixel-10-pro-fold-vs-galaxy-z-fold-7-10" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold vs. Galaxy Z Fold 7 camera comparisons" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4D7rVF9cxNBQKCP2qumTKA.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The entire picture just looks like it's an attempt at being AI generated, while the Pixel looks crisp and clean without much artifacting at all.

On top of that, you can disable wireless charging so the Belkin Stage PowerGrip isn't unnecessarily draining its battery when in use.</p><h2 id="with-kraftgeek-you-get-what-you-pay-for-2">With KraftGeek, you get what you pay for</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="A9s8StZTGZRfCdvxnDmmom" name="KraftGeek-PowerShutter-lifestyle-2" alt="KraftGeek PowerShutter power bank stand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/A9s8StZTGZRfCdvxnDmmom.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oyx3ALvazFS86jWLcvuKfm" name="KraftGeek-PowerShutter-lifestyle-4" alt="KraftGeek PowerShutter power bank stand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oyx3ALvazFS86jWLcvuKfm.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9kYQvmsjCmamvEcfBAHcVm" name="KraftGeek-PowerShutter-lifestyle-1" alt="KraftGeek PowerShutter power bank stand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9kYQvmsjCmamvEcfBAHcVm.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3732px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="L69LbVqztyvncXVmuxRz2n" name="KraftGeek-PowerShutter-lifestyle-3" alt="KraftGeek PowerShutter power bank stand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/L69LbVqztyvncXVmuxRz2n.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3732" height="2099" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>When it comes to KraftGeek's option, you cannot turn off the wireless charging feature, so it's constantly recharging your phone wirelessly when in use.

The extended battery life alone is worth the splurge. It's perfect for vacations and trips where you need to take lots of pictures and videos but have battery anxiety.</p><p>Additionally, since you can turn the wireless charging off on the Belkin camera stand power bank, it also helps you conserve its power instead of wasting it unnecessarily. The built-in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-cables-adapters">Type-C cable</a> can get awkward to use, but it's so convenient to have. You don't have to worry about packing a separate cable.</p><p>At $36.99, the KraftGeek PowerShutter is an absolute steal. It's a fantastic alternative to the more premium Belkin Stage PowerGrip. However, if you can afford to spend another $43, the $79.99 Belkin option will make you a lot happier!</p><p>Bonus tip: If you really want the Belkin Stage PowerGrip but are counting the change you found in your couch, just wait for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/black-friday">Black Friday</a> to grab a good deal on it.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="fbd705e0-0de2-4342-8cb0-d77ac1bac2c4">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7rFzrde4WMTrbhhtDfqpPU.jpg' alt="Belkin Stage PowerGrip"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Belkin Stage PowerGrip</div>                                <div class="stars__reviews"><span itemprop="reviewRating" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Rating" class="chunk rating"><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star half"></span><meta itemprop="bestRating" content="100.0" /><meta itemprop="worstRating" content="0.0" /><meta itemprop="ratingValue" content="70" /></span></div>                </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>High capacity, high cost</strong></em></p><p>Looking for the perfect photography-friendly power bank for your MagSafe or Qi2 phone?

Arriving this week, OPPO says owners of a Find N3, Find N3 Flip, or a Find N3 Pad 3 Pro can expect the major Android OS upgrade to begin on November 11.</p><p>Moreover, the company is stacking its update rollout schedule, as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">Find N5</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a>, and the Find X8 have already started receiving it, as of November 6.</p><p>OPPO states that while these dates are when it will begin pushing the update, consumers shouldn't expect it that day (but if it arrives, then lovely!). The community post says that ColorOS 16 is rolling out "in batches," meaning that it could take a few days to a few weeks before <em>everyone </em>receives it. The main takeaway here is that ColorOS 16 should at least hit your phone or foldable or tablet at some point in November.</p><p>OPPO's ColorOS 16 update closely mirrors what OnePlus folks <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-oxygenos-16-arrives-as-a-software-that-truly-knows-you">got with OxygenOS 16</a>. However, for the sake of OPPO, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.oppo.com/thread/1982322128027910153">its official post states</a> users will find AI Mind Space, a smarter AI Recorder, unification between iPhone calls and its devices, PC mirroring, and much more.</p><h2 id="it-s-late-in-the-year-which-means-updates-galore-2">It's late in the year, which means updates galore</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="TB9TBAfdgCaLP8L7FWWEsW" name="oppo-find-x8-pro-16.jpg" alt="OPPO Find X8 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TB9TBAfdgCaLP8L7FWWEsW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As highlighted at the top of the article, OnePlus has been busy pushing its OxygenOS 16 update. The folks at 9to5 mention that the company's tablets, the Pad 3 and Pad 2, have since started receiving the major upgrade.</p><p>Just before the weekend, OnePlus <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-12-gets-its-promised-android-16-update-on-schedule-with-open-foldable">started rolling out the update</a> to the OnePlus 12 and the Open foldable. The patch was announced for users in India first; however, it's expected to soon spread across to more regions as we move through November. Among the highlights, OxygenOS 16 brings a revamped UI experience that's designed to be much smoother and fluid than before.</p><p>OnePlus states it's reworked its visuals, as well as refreshed apps, AI, and more. The Mind Assistant, hitting the OnePlus 12, is capable of getting you to your saved content even faster. Even the past-gen device's camera is receiving some updates, as the company introduces better controls to help users get those creative juices flowing and into reality.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The app is a universal hub for location sharing and tracking of items, devices, and people. In the latest Find Hub app update on the Google Play Store, Google adds a redesigned account menu and dedicated toggle for units of distance measurement.</p><p>The new Find Hub app update is version 3.1.458, and starting to roll out as of Monday, Nov. 10. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/11/10/find-hub-device-list/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a> spotted the updated Find Hub app that includes a <strong>Distance units </strong>menu for the first time. Here, users can customize the unit of measurement Find Hub uses to display distance and location data.</p><p>The fresh menu has four choices available, including a <strong>Use default</strong> setting that will follow your Android device's system setting. The other <strong>Distance units</strong> menu options are <strong>Metric</strong>, <strong>U.S.</strong>, and <strong>U.K.</strong> You can find the menu page in the <strong>Settings</strong> section of the Find Hub app.</p><p>Additionally, the Find Hub app update includes a fullscreen Google account menu. This tweak has previously rolled out to most other Google apps, including Google Messages and the Google Play Store. Users can open it by pressing their Google account profile picture in the Find Hub app.</p><p>While some users are seeing Find Hub v3.1.458 now, it appears to be a slow rollout.</p><h2 id="google-updates-its-list-of-supported-find-hub-trackers-and-more-2">Google updates its list of supported Find Hub trackers and more</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="2kQ8hfyB9rqN2pT49KiSvR" name="find-device-5.jpg" alt="Find My Device phone page showcasing location details" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2kQ8hfyB9rqN2pT49KiSvR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In a separate move, Google also updated its Find Hub <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.android.com/learn-find-hub/compatible-devices/" target="_blank">compatible devices page</a> on the web.
