                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Android 15 hit a wide variety of Android phones last year, but Google Pixel devices got a few exclusive perks with a Pixel Feature Drop in October 2024. Part of the update included a clever Pixel ecosystem feature that makes it easier for people with multiple Pixel phones and tablets to manage notifications. It leverages Google's Cross Device Service, and ensures you won't have to clear out the same notifications on each of your Pixel devices.</p><p>The feature, called <strong>Dismiss notifications across Pixel devices</strong>, is only useful if you enable it on all your Pixel phones and tablets running <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> for the same Google account. Setup requires a handful of taps and granting a few permissions. Luckily, you only have to do it once for each phone or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Pixel Tablet</a>, and we've got a complete guide walking you through the process below.</p>
<h2 id="how-notification-sync-works-on-pixel-phones-and-pixel-tablet-2">How notification sync works on Pixel phones and Pixel Tablet</h2>
<p>The idea behind <strong>Dismiss notifications across Pixel devices</strong> is simple. Chances are, you're signed into the same accounts on all your Pixel phones and tablets, and you'll get duplicate notifications from those accounts. To save you from manually clearing these notifications on every Pixel device you own, Google will intelligently do it for you with this feature enabled.</p><p>The notification statuses for devices only sync when they are connected to a Wi-Fi network at the moment. There's reason to believe <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-might-finally-let-you-sync-pixel-notifications-over-cellular-data">Google is working on a cellular data option</a>, but it isn't available yet.</p><p>To use this feature, follow the steps below on all your Pixel devices. Make sure they're updated to the latest version of Android 15 and are using the same Google account.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-turn-on-pixel-notification-sync-2">How to turn on Pixel notification sync</h2>
<p>After updating all your Pixel devices to the latest build of Android 15, you'll need to manually enable the <strong>Dismiss notifications across Pixel devices </strong>feature on each Pixel phone or tablet you own. Further, you'll need to select the Google account you want to dismiss notifications for. Here's how to do it:</p>
<p>1. Open the <strong>Settings app</strong> on your Pixel phone or tablet.</p><p>2. Tap the <strong>Notifications</strong> tab in the list.</p><p>3. Scroll down to the <strong>Sync across devices</strong> section and press <strong>Dismiss notifications across Pixel devices</strong>.</p><p>4. Tap the toggle beside <strong>Dismiss on this device</strong>.</p>

<p>5. A prompt will appear titled <strong>Allow notification access for this feature</strong>. Tap <strong>Go</strong> to continue.</p><p>6. This will jump you to the <strong>Notification read, reply, and control </strong>page for the <strong>Device Connectivity Service</strong>. Tap the toggle beside <strong>Allow notification access</strong>.</p><p>7. Tap <strong>Allow</strong> on the prompt that appears.</p><p>8. Return to the <strong>Dismiss notifications across Pixel devices</strong> page and tap the Google account you want to use.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2m34YHMpPgYBaNbuuQkMEN" name="Dismiss-Pixel-Notifications-Screenshots-2" alt="The dismiss notifications across Pixel devices settings options." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2m34YHMpPgYBaNbuuQkMEN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>9. Repeat these steps on each Pixel device you want to use with notification sync.</p>
<p>From there, notifications you have dismissed on one device will automatically be dismissed on others with this setting enabled. You can turn this feature off, or change the Google account used, at any time in the Settings app.</p>

<p>This handy notification sync feature will be most useful for people who own a Pixel phone, like the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a>, and a Pixel Tablet. It'll also be convenient for those with multiple Pixel phones — you might have a work and personal Pixel, or simply keep an old Pixel phone around for use as a media player or a backup. Whatever your reason for using multiple Pixel devices, this notification syncing feature will make sure you don't get déjà vu clearing out old notifications more than once.</p>

Maybe.</p><p>Last spring, the Biden administration passed legislation that would ban TikTok on national security grounds unless the parent company, ByteDance, sells off the U.S. version of the app to another company.</p><p>If the ban passes as scheduled, Apple and Google would be forced to remove the app from their respective app stores, though existing users can still use the app if it was already installed. Eventually, though, the older versions of the app will stop working altogether.</p><p>ByteDance <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/bytedance-prefers-tiktok-shutdown-us-if-legal-options-fail-sources-say-2024-04-25/" target="_blank">hasn't shown much interest</a> in selling off TikTok's U.S. assets, so TikTok has explored other options, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/tiktok-is-suing-the-us-government-to-stop-a-law-that-bans-the-app" target="_blank">appealing the legislation</a> in the Supreme Court, saying it violates the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment protection against government infringement of free speech.</p><p>It seems that the Supreme Court justices are willing to allow the ban to go forward, but no decision has been made at the time of this writing. TikTok has reportedly stated that it will shut down the app in the U.S. if the ban goes through. Android Central has reached out to TikTok regarding its plans and will update this article when we have more information</p><p>TikTok does have another hope, though, and that lies with the U.S. Senate and President-elect Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Trump has decided he doesn't want TikTok banned, though he has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/28/us/politics/trump-tik-tok-ban.html">called for it in the past</a>. He is urging the Supreme Court to halt or delay the ban until he has time to pursue negotiations.</p><p>According to a brief filed by Trump last Friday, "<em>President Trump alone possesses the consummate deal-making expertise, the electoral mandate and the political will to negotiate a resolution to save the platform while addressing the national security concerns expressed by the government — concerns which President Trump himself has acknowledged.</em>"</p><p>President Trump will be sworn into office on January 20, just one day after the ban. He could then pause the ban for 90 days if TikTok has shown a willingness to comply. Senators Rand Paul (R-KY) and ED Markey (D-MA) have also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/sens-markey-paul-rep-khanna-file-bipartisan-bicameral-amicus-brief-urging-scotus-to-protect-free-speech-and-reverse-tiktok-ban">filed a brief</a> with the court to delay the ban.</p><p>Finally, Senator Markey, a member of the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, also has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-markey-to-introduce-bill-to-extend-deadline-for-tiktok-ban-takes-to-senate-floor-in-support-of-vibrant-online-communities">introduced legislation</a> to Congress to extend the ban by 120 days. Market acknowledges TikTok's dangers and possible security issues but says too many people depend on the app economically.</p><p><em>“Let me be clear: TikTok has its problems. Like every social media platform, TikTok poses a serious risk to the privacy and mental health of our young people. I will continue to hold TikTok accountable for such behavior. But a TikTok ban would impose serious consequences on millions of Americans who depend on the app for social connections and their economic livelihood. We cannot allow that to happen.”</em></p>

<p>None of this may matter, and come Sunday, TikTok will be banned in the U.S. Some people will approve, some not, and others are apathetic over the situation.</p><p>One thing to consider is that lawmakers — even the few who <em>aren't</em> tech luddites — who have seen the intelligence reports support some sort of action are the ones who called for the ban. Regular people who love or loathe TikTok have not seen it. That doesn't mean we can't have an opinion.</p><p>My own? If there are true national security issues with TikTok and not just xenophobic drumming against China, ban it until they can be addressed. Go a step further and block it. Maybe even take the necessary action so it can't be accessed through a VPN (yes, that's 100% possible). Then extend the same scrutiny to <em><strong>all</strong></em> tech companies, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-us-lawkmakers-want-tiktok-banned">not just the ones from China</a></p><p>I've asked around the office and the internet-at-large, and opinions are mixed. I've heard things like, "I don't care, but my partner does," "I'm not in the U.S., so I'm unaffected," and people in India are just saying, "What's TikTok?" (The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/indian-government-bans-tiktok-uc-browser-and-other-chinese-apps-security-reasons">Indian government banned TikTok</a> in 2020 over national security concerns.)</p><p>People opposed to the ban bring up some very valid points — should the government infringe on TikTok's First Amendment protections, and why aren't Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram facing the same ban?</p><p>The obvious answer is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tech-war-china-ramping">China</a>. The U.S. and China are not on very friendly terms so any advantage China may gain through data collected by TikTok is concerning. Facebook and other U.S. companies can be forced to do things the government's way via legislation. Chinese companies can't.</p><p>The First Amendment question may soon be answered by the Supreme Court; even a non-decision acknowledges that TikTok's protections can be limited.</p><p>We'll know more on Sunday.</p>

                    <p><p><em><strong>The best</strong></em></p><p>The OnePlus 13 is one of the best flagships of 2025. It has a stunning design with a new microfiber vegan leather back that feels great to hold and use, and the chassis has increased resilience against tumbles. You get the latest Qualcomm silicon, and the phone is among the fastest I've used. The cameras at the back hold their own against the best that Google and Samsung have to offer, you get a 6000mAh silicon battery with fast charging, and it doesn't miss out on any extras. In short, this isn't just the best OnePlus phone, but one of the best Android phones you can buy today. </p></p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9pTnnnNAANcjX3unuTtnhH" name="OnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13 next to OnePlus 13R" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9pTnnnNAANcjX3unuTtnhH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OnePlus overhauled the design of its devices this year, switching to boxier sides — just like every other manufacturer. That said, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> has beveled edges that made holding and using the phone that much easier, and the weight distribution is ideal. The best part is that although the device has a bigger battery than last year, it is thinner and lighter. <br><br>There's also a new color option with a unique texture at the back. The Midnight Ocean model has a gorgeous blue hue and a microfiber vegan leather back that's unlike anything else available today; it's soft to touch and has a great in-hand feel, and if you're eyeing the device, this is the model to get.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rsBt6ehuKZVWBecL63wtTH" name="OnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13 next to OnePlus 13R" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rsBt6ehuKZVWBecL63wtTH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a> doesn't have beveled sides, and as a result, it isn't as comfortable to hold; the sides tend to dig into your hand, and I recommend using a case with the device. That said, it has aluminum sides, and better durability than last year. While I don't like the design as much as the OnePlus 13, the phone is a smidgen lighter, and unlike last year, you get a flat panel, so it's better in that regard.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="obpqgqgQdbUA68QWJPGoUH" name="OnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13 next to OnePlus 13R" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/obpqgqgQdbUA68QWJPGoUH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both devices have the alert slider, an IR blaster, and stereo sound. Water resistance is included as well, and while the OnePlus 13 gets IP68 and IP69 dust and water resistance, the 13R is limited to IP65. It is good enough against splashes, but doesn't cover immersion in water.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="VavufYaftRSVojzGhPWVVH" name="OnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13 next to OnePlus 13R" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VavufYaftRSVojzGhPWVVH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In a similar vein, the OnePlus 13 gets a Goodix ultrasonic fingerprint module that's among the best you can get on any phone today, and it is fast and doesn't have any issues. The OnePlus 13R uses an optical module, and while it is also fast, the sensor is located lower on the panel, making it awkward to access. <br><br>I like the design and in-hand feel of the OnePlus 13 over the 13R, but the latter is definitely better than last year's model, and that's a big deal in and of itself.</p>
<h2 id="oneplus-13-vs-oneplus-13r-display-2">OnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 13R: Display</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rD29xTC98u5N3ZtAHWxNjH" name="OnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13 next to OnePlus 13R" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rD29xTC98u5N3ZtAHWxNjH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The OnePlus 13 has a slightly bigger 6.82-inch AMOLED panel going up to 120Hz, with the 13R using the same 6.78-inch panel as the OnePlus 12. Both phones have a quoted maximum of 4500 nits in HDR, but that's a meaningless number; in actual use, the OnePlus 13 gets noticeably brighter outdoors. It isn't to say that the 13R isn't good in its own right, but of the two devices, the OnePlus 13 has the better panel.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="mBvmiKPsUrcVm75A82P2mH" name="OnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13 next to OnePlus 13R" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mBvmiKPsUrcVm75A82P2mH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both phones have vibrant colors and excellent contrast, and stereo sound is detailed enough that you can play games using the onboard audio. On that note, you can play limited titles at 120fps, but there are instances where it leads to increased jitter. There are no issues with streaming content or regular use, with both phones holding up incredibly well in this regard.</p>
<p>Another notable fact is that both devices get flat panels this time. The OnePlus 13 has a slight edge on the sides that makes it a little more immersive, but neither device gets the dual-curved panel that was a mainstay until last year. The glass coating is new as well, with the OnePlus 13 using a custom solution that includes ceramic, and the 13R coming with Gorilla Glass 7i.</p>
<h2 id="oneplus-13-vs-oneplus-13r-hardware-2">OnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 13R: Hardware</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="aiv467bYtho52GydnZcSjH" name="OnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13 next to OnePlus 13R" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aiv467bYtho52GydnZcSjH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The OnePlus 13 has one of the strongest hardware packages available today. It features Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 8 Elite, and comes with 12GB of LPDDR5X RAM and 256GB of UFS 4.0 storage as standard, with configurations going up to 1TB. While the 256GB and 512GB variants are sold globally, the 1TB model is limited to China and India. <br><br>After using the OnePlus 13 for over three weeks, I can say that it is one of the fastest phones of 2025. It doesn't have any slowdowns in regular use, the software is optimized incredibly well, and you get a fluidity that's better than just about every other Android interface. It does a great job with gaming as well, and I didn't run into any issues with overheating. There is noticeable throttling at the 30-minute mark, but it doesn't pose much in the way of problems.</p>

<p>In short, this is a terrific package if you need a high-end phone. What's particularly interesting is that all of these statements are valid for the OnePlus 13R as well; while not having the latest hardware, it is powered by last year's Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, and it is just as good in daily use as well as gaming. <br><br>If anything, I think the OnePlus 13R is a better choice as it gives you flagship internals for a lot less than the OnePlus 13. You get UFS 4.0 storage, and the base model starts with 256GB this time. There's 12GB of RAM as well, and you get the same fluidity with the software. <br><br>You get similar connectivity as well, including Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, AptX HD, dual-band GPS alongside NFC, and new BeaconLink tech that builds on Bluetooth by delivering increased range of up to 300 meters. The only thing missing on the OnePlus 13R is eSIM connectivity; you're limited to dual nano-SIM slots, so if you need this feature, you'll need to get the regular model.</p>
<h2 id="oneplus-13-vs-oneplus-13r-battery-life-2">OnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 13R: Battery life</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LkbsMtca8JzNMDxLkmRyfH" name="OnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13 next to OnePlus 13R" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LkbsMtca8JzNMDxLkmRyfH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both phones get 6000mAh batteries, but the OnePlus uses a silicon-carbon anode, delivering better density and the ability to withstand extreme cold. The phone has a dual-cell configuration with two 3000mAh batteries, and as a result, it takes just 38 minutes to fully charge using the 80W standard. The 13R, meanwhile, has a single 6000mAh battery, and it takes close to an hour to charge. <br><br>The 13R misses out on wireless charging as well, which is where the OnePlus 13 excels. The phone gets 15W charging over the Qi standard, and there's 50W AirVOOC as well, thanks to a new magnetic puck. The device doesn't have the requisite magnets, and you'll need to buy a case to enable the tech. <br><br>Although the OnePlus 13R doesn't have the extras, it lasted longer in my testing. While I got a day and a half on both devices, the OnePlus 13R delivered an additional two hours of screen-on time consistently, and that's interesting.</p>
<h2 id="oneplus-13-vs-oneplus-13r-cameras-2">OnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 13R: Cameras</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ZD9tpSMioRfEMgypYQLecH" name="OnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13 next to OnePlus 13R" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZD9tpSMioRfEMgypYQLecH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The OnePlus 13 has a trio of 50MP cameras at the back, including a 50MP Sony LYT-808 main camera, 50MP Sony LYT-600 telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom and OIS, and a 50MP wide-angle lens. It takes fantastic photos in just about any scenario, and you get photos that are on the same caliber as the Galaxy S24 Ultra and Pixel 9 Pro XL.</p>
<iframe allow="" height="480" width="100%" data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=ec3764ba-cf47-11ef-9397-d93975fe8866"></iframe>
<p>The 13R has a 50MP Sony LYT-700 as the main camera, and it's joined by a 50MP Samsung JN5 telephoto lens that goes up to 2x, and an 8MP wide-angle lens. The camera interface is similar to what you get on the OnePlus 13, but there isn't Hasselblad integration, so you miss out on a few shooting modes and effects.</p>
<iframe allow="" height="480" width="100%" data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=ffb1448e-cf47-11ef-9397-d93975fe8866"></iframe>
<p>That said, the OnePlus 13R also manages to take standout photos with the main camera, and barring scenes with little to no light, it holds up well. The biggest difference is the versatility; the auxiliary cameras aren't anywhere as good, so you don't get the same caliber of shots at 3x and 6x zoom, and the wide-angle lens doesn't quite deliver the same tonality in low-light situations.</p>
<iframe allow="" height="480" width="100%" data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=40eb9d00-cf48-11ef-9397-d93975fe8866"></iframe>
<p>Although it may not be as good as the OnePlus 13, I'll note that the main camera on the 13R is great in its own right, and if anything, it is the best shooter in its category.</p>
<h2 id="oneplus-13-vs-oneplus-13r-software-2">OnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 13R: Software</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="swi3QTAtNdrU36QBCUHqmH" name="OnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13 next to OnePlus 13R" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/swi3QTAtNdrU36QBCUHqmH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both phones run OxygenOS 15 based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a>, and in my usage, I didn't see any difference in the software. That's a good thing, as it's clear that OnePlus doesn't want to limit its best software features to its flagship. What's noticeable this time is that the interface has better fluidity, and that is the case on both the OnePlus 13 and 13R. <br><br>Obviously, you get the usual AI-focused additions, and they do a decent enough job. Although the interface isn't as minimalist as I'd like, it has an exhaustive set of customization options, and you can tweak the lock screen, notification pane, and home screen to your tastes, and there are plenty of useful utilities around multitasking and gestures. <br><br>As for updates, both phones will pick up four years of Android OS updates alongside six years of software updates. Again, it's good to see the OnePlus 13R get the same software update guarantee as its costlier sibling.</p>
<h2 id="oneplus-13-vs-oneplus-13r-which-should-you-buy-2">OnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 13R: Which should you buy?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="evyLE4V266hsDrST9GxjgH" name="OnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13 next to OnePlus 13R" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/evyLE4V266hsDrST9GxjgH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I used both devices extensively, and I can say with some confidence that they're among the best OnePlus phones to date. The OnePlus 13 is my go-to recommendation if you need a flagship that has everything: a great design, the best internals, standout cameras, long-lasting battery, and useful software extras. There isn't anything missing on the device, and even though it costs more than last year, you're getting a suite of upgrades that justifies the hike. <br><br>Now, if you don't need the best cameras, the OnePlus 13R is the obvious choice — and a much better value. It may not have the same auxiliary cameras as the OnePlus 13, but the main camera still manages to shoot great photos, and the rest of the hardware isn't that different: you still get top-notch internals, a battery that lasts even longer, an AMOLED panel that's just as good, and the same software. The only limitation is IP65 water resistance, and longer charging times. <br><br>The upside is that the OnePlus 13R costs $300 less than the OnePlus 13, and that is nothing to scoff at. It's an easier recommendation in India, where the device costs just ₹42,999 ($496) — the same as last year. If you want to save some cash and still get great hardware and usable cameras, the OnePlus 13R is my pick.

It has a better design with increased durability, the latest hardware, amazing cameras, long-lasting battery, and fluid software that's great to use.

<p>While Oura has been around for many years, it can be clearly noted that 2024 was its year of spearheading the smart ring movement. We saw many companies launch a version of what they think a smart ring should be, and of course, the Android giant Samsung even launched the Galaxy Ring.</p><p>I had the opportunity to sit down with the CEO of the Oura Ring, Tom Hale, to speak about the company, what it’s accomplished, and what the future holds, particularly for health and wellness tracking.</p><p>Hale told me it’s refreshing to see competition because it means that “you’re on to something that’s important and valuable.”</p><p>Presently, there are two companies leading the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">smart ring</a> market, with Oura in the lead. An <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blogs.idc.com/2024/10/23/the-future-of-smart-rings/" target="_blank">IDC report on smart rings</a> indicated that Ultrahuman is the second largest brand and that in the full year of 2023, global ring sales totaled 880,000 “with Oura representing 80% and Ultrahuman in second with 12%.” By 2028, IDC forecasts that 3.2 million units will be sold equating to a year-over-year growth of 29.5%.</p><p>Samsung launched the Galaxy Ring last summer, and IDC indicated that at the time of publication (October 2024), the early reception was of moderate interest. But that being said, many of the larger players within the wearables space are watching Samsung Ring sales.</p><p>“[These companies] are exploring the possibility of producing their own smart rings. So should the Galaxy Ring prove to be a success, we will likely see many other players jumping into the market,” the report read.</p>

<p>I’ve been using the Oura Ring for almost two and a half years now. I started with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oura-ring-gen-3-review#:~:text=It's%20durable%2C%20lightweight%2C%20and%20discreet,of%20sight%2C%20out%20of%20mind.">Gen 3</a> and then now I’m using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-review">Oura Ring 4</a>. The ring has completely changed the way I think about my health and body, and, more importantly, I’ve noticed that I am able to change and correct my path by doing things based on my stats.</p><p>After using the rings for some time, I think what most people fail to recognize is that a smart ring is a passive device that monitors your health. Yes it has features to track your fitness, but it’s more for monitoring health features like your heart rate, readiness, how you manage your stress, and women’s health.</p><p>Hale expressed that the ultimate vision for the Oura Ring is that it is a health tool for people.</p><p>“Our vision of the future of smart rings is bigger and bolder and badder than just the ring. I think about going beyond the ring,” he said.</p><p>Oura recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://investors.dexcom.com/news/news-details/2024/Dexcom-and-URA-Announce-Strategic-Partnership/default.aspx">partnered with Dexcom</a>, a glucose biosensing company, to help people improve their metabolic health. The plan is that Dexcom will help “the integration of Dexcom glucose data with vital sign, sleep, stress, heart health and activity data from Oura Ring…to provide users with a more complete picture of overall health.”</p><p>Hale expressed that Oura wants to help people understand more about their health across a wider range of metrics, and understanding glucose is the next step.</p><p>“[It’s] not just going to be one set of data. [It’s] going to be a set of data that is the most complete picture of your health,” he said.</p><p>To me, this is what a smart ring should be. Right now, when I check my Oura app to see my data, I can see and track the kinds of things that have triggered my stress or what has caused me not to have the greatest sleep. I can also track my ovulation, menstrual cycle, heart rate, and body temperature.</p><p>And now, with the launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-symptom-radar-early-stress-signs-announced">new Symptom Radar feature</a>, my ring can warn me about early signs of strain on my body, such as when I may start feeling under the weather or if I need to take extra rest when major changes take place in my regular data.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-your-data-is-not-a-game-2">Understanding your data is not a game</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rGQs7nag3abwkJeuSmT4VD" name="oura-ring-symptom-radar-hero-wide" alt="Oura introduced its Symptom Radar for the Ring 4 and Gen 3." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rGQs7nag3abwkJeuSmT4VD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Oura)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What I appreciate the most about the Oura Ring is how it is a passive device. You wear it, it tracks your data and you get to monitor it at your own leisure. There aren’t any major notifications; there aren’t haptics and nothing to make you feel guilty.</p><p>This is why I think smart rings, in general, are not meant to be treated like an Apple Watch or a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch</a> but something to be used in tandem with these devices. One of the main purposes of a smartwatch is to help track your fitness and help you stay motivated. The Apple Watch, for example, will ping you to encourage you to close your movement rings for the day.</p><p>But while the gamification of a smartwatch makes sense, it’s not always the most de-stressing component of a wearable. One of the reasons why I stopped wearing an Apple watch was because of this. I was constantly being bombarded with notifications, and it really stressed me out to the point where my anxiety was at its highest. I think one of the reasons why I love the Oura Ring is that it’s incredibly passive and I can go in and check my stats at my own leisure.</p><p>Yes, I do get some notifications from Oura. For example, it'll ping me when it thinks I should start getting ready for bed for optimal sleep and when it thinks I’ve been sitting for too long and suggests stretching my legs. However, I do not find these notifications bothersome or stressful because Oura isn't focused on turning health and wellness into a game, and this is something I think the Oura Ring does much better than smartwatches.</p><p>In fact, Hale stated clearly that the future of Oura isn’t going to be about that gamification of your data and that the company will focus on features like Symptom Radar that help users become more in tune with their bodies and overall wellness.</p><p>“You’ll see us continuing to push innovations, but we always push innovations in the name of health, not in the name of gamification or getting you to engage more frequently…[we want you to] think about where your body is going and to give your body a voice.”</p>

<ul><li>Honor's latest Porsche Design collaboration is coming to Europe next month for €1,799.</li><li>The Porsche Design Honor Magic 7 RSR features a sports car-inspired design and Honor Magic 7 Pro specs.</li><li>The Magic 7 RSR includes a bigger battery than the European variant of the Magic 7 Pro.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Honor today announced its newest collaboration with Porsche Design: the Porsche Design Honor Magic 7 RSR. It's a premium smartphone that takes cues from Porsche's design language and the Honor Magic 7 Pro. Combined, this makes the Magic 7 RSR an attractive and powerful device — you'll just have to be willing to pay a lump sum for it.</p><p>The Porsche Design Honor Magic 7 RSR will debut across Europe starting Feb. 21, 2025. It'll be available for a starting price of €1,799, which is about $1,850. It's actually cheaper than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/porsche-design-honor-magic-6-rsr-review">Honor Magic 6 RSR</a>, since that high-end smartphone launched in Europe last year for a price equivalent to roughly $2,000.</p><p>While the Honor Magic 7 RSR is heavily based on the Magic 7 Pro in terms of hardware, it's specifically built upon the China variant of Honor's flagship. That's because the Magic 7 RSR version ships with a 5,850mAh silicon-carbon battery, whereas <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-announced-europe">the standard Magic 7 Pro sold in Europe</a> will feature a smaller 5,270mAh capacity.</p><p>Otherwise, the Magic 7 RSR includes Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset — uniquely equipped to handle on-device AI tasks. Honor's latest phones, including the Magic 7 RSR, come with a mix of on-device and cloud AI features. These include AI Real-Time Rendering and AI Predictive Scheduling Engine, that Honor claims "delivers PC-level graphics."</p><p>The chassis has a line down the back that mimics the body lines of a real Porsche, and the camera housing is meant to resemble sports car headlights, per the brand. Beneath the sleek housing is the same set of cameras as the Honor Magic 7 Pro, headlined by a 50MP, f/1.4 to f/2.0 adjustable aperture sensor with optical image stabilization. That's paired with a 200MP periscope telephoto camera offering 3x optical zoom and a 50MP wide camera with a 122-degree field-of-view.</p><p>When the Honor Magic 7 RSR becomes available for purchase in Europe next month, it'll be a more premium version of the Magic 7 Pro with better looks and a bigger battery. You can get it in Agate Grey and Provence (purple) colorways.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Does your comfortable fluoroelastomer smartwatch band contain toxic chemicals that could transfer through your skin and cause eventual health issues? A scientific study suggests yes, but smartwatch brands like Apple and Google reassured me otherwise — at least about <em>their</em> straps.</p><p>Late last year, the nonprofit American Chemical Society posted a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.estlett.4c00907#">damning and concerning report</a>, "Presence of Perfluorohexanoic Acid in Fluoroelastomer Watch Bands," by Wicks et al., suggesting that most common watch bands from the last few years have high levels of PFAS and PFHxA compounds with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://iris.epa.gov/static/pdfs/0704_summary.pdf">potential adverse health effects</a> to the liver, thyroid, and other organs, as well as cancer.</p><p>The news made the rounds on consumer tech sites, and most readers had reason to worry: fluoroelastomer is one of the most common band materials for mainstream watches, along with silicone.</p><p>However, the study didn't say <em>which</em> smartwatch straps they tested had toxic chemicals, except that they purchased 22 bands "across numerous brands and price points" from Amazon and Best Buy in 2023 and that 13 of the 22 tested bands were advertised to contain fluoroelastomer.</p><p>I got my hands on the full paywalled report, which shows how they used particle-induced gamma-ray emission and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to determine which bands contained fluoride, PFAS, or PFHxA chemicals. The first is an expected ingredient in fluoroelastomer bands; the latter two are likely dangerous if ingested.</p><p>Of the 13 bands advertised as fluoroelastomer, seven had significant PFAS/ PFHxA chemical concentrations, while six had none or safely negligible concentrations. Of the other nine — likely using silicone or other common strap materials — only <em>one</em> had high PFAS/ PFHxA concentrations, and its high fluoride percentage suggests it might be a fluoroelastomer band in disguise.</p><p>What does this tell us? Fluoroelastomer bands aren't <em>inherently</em> dangerous because some brands remove or avoid using harmful chemicals in their manufacturing. The problem is that a majority of brands don't bother to do so, either out of negligence or ignorance of the implications. And we don't know which brands these are.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2316px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="x4H2so59RK3eKNV49PLGQg" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-3-band-lineup-official-photo.jpg" alt="A press photo of the official Google Pixel Watch 3 bands" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/x4H2so59RK3eKNV49PLGQg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2316" height="1303" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ingesting or inhaling PFAS compounds is dangerous, but most people aren't going to eat their smartwatch straps. The question is whether or not "dermal absorption" of these chemicals is likely over years of wearing your smartwatch.</p><p>The team behind this ACS report can only answer this question vaguely because "dermal absorption of PFAS is poorly described" in a few scant studies. But because people wear smartwatches for 12+ hours per day, it "poses an opportunity for significant transfer to the dermis and subsequent human exposure."</p><p>They specifically suggest that the "additional sweat contact and open skin pores" caused by wearing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness smartwatches</a> for workouts could pose an additional risk — though thankfully, many fitness watches default to sweat-wicking silicone or nylon bands.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vDcBJxp9j24ux72DFqMFiD" name="Samsung-galaxy-watch-7-band-01.jpg" alt="The new official bands for the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vDcBJxp9j24ux72DFqMFiD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The study cites tests on mice that indicate PFAS and PFHxA will eventually absorb into your organs and bloodstream if placed on the skin. An "<em>in vitro</em> human skin equivalent model" absorbed "more than 50% of a PFHxA exposure dose."</p><p>Despite all this fearful language, it remains educated conjecture, not a certainty. It's unclear how much PFAS and PFHxA will actually transfer into your body over time and whether it would ever reach high enough levels to pose a health risk.</p><p>The study itself concludes that the findings "highlight a critical need for a more comprehensive exposure study of PFHxA that arises from fluoroelastomer watch bands worn on human skin." They never conclude a direct correlation between wearing a fluoroelastomer band and getting sick.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Some fluoroelastomer bands have toxic chemicals, but we don't know whether they actually transfer through your skin, or if it's enough to cause long-term harm.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>A relevant parallel to this fear-inducing study is the recent panic over black plastic cooking utensils and pans with high levels of flame retardants (via the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/toxic-black-plastic-kitchen-alternatives/">New York Times</a>), with evidence suggesting that these chemicals could leach into your food over time, especially in the presence of high cooking temperatures and oils.</p><p>That report probably led to some mass-dumping of black plastic spatulas, but it arose later in 2024 that the scientists had <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/study-miscalculation-has-everyone-talking-about-black-plastic-spatulas-again/">made a math error</a> that magnified the issue by 10X, making it look worse than it was. And truly, the only way that the retardants will transfer to your food in significant quantities is if you leave your spatula sitting in hot oil for minutes at a time, which most people naturally wouldn't do.</p><p>My point is you can certainly replace your fluoroelastomer band; there are so many watch band alternatives like silicone, nylon, metal, and leather, if you're concerned. However, until there's concrete evidence of the <em>rate</em> or <em>impact</em> of dermal PFAS/PFHxA absorption in humans, you shouldn't panic about the years you've spent wearing a fluoroelastomer strap.</p><p>Plus, <em>your</em> fluoroelastomer band may not have any PFAS or PFHxA chemicals to begin with!</p>

<p>I emailed my contacts at Apple, Google, and Samsung about this report, asking if they have any comment on the findings, if their customers have reason to switch bands, and if they'll change any manufacturing processes in the future.</p><p>Samsung has yet to get back to me, but Apple and Google readily shared white papers indicating that they're already aware of the potential dangers and proactively remove PFAS from their smartwatch bands.</p><p>"Pixel Watch bands meet industry standards with regard to PFAS," Google told Android Central. "We proactively limit PFAS in our products and are committed to minimizing PFAS beyond what is required by law." Its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sustainability.google/reports/990-00012-00/">white paper</a> references PFAS, saying it would avoid "detectable levels" or up to 25 ppb of the compound in any device.</p><p>Apple's statement echoes Google's, and the company shared its 2022 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apple.com/environment/pdf/Apple_PFAS_Commitment_November-2022.pdf">white paper</a> outlining its PFAS policy.</p><p>"Over a decade ago, we successfully eliminated two PFAS members — PFAS and PFOA — from our products," Apple told Android Central. "Apple has been working to phase out PFAS from all our products and manufacturing processes, which includes engaging with all of our supply chain partners and developing safer alternatives."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="VBMaZUZdQBNrGEvpfo2xUC" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-7-vs-6-6.jpeg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 (left, black) and Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 (right, silver) side-by-side" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VBMaZUZdQBNrGEvpfo2xUC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I'll update this post if Samsung responds, but I did find the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/global/sustainability/policy-file/AYVhebWqCXoAIx95/Standards_for_Control_of_Substances_Used_in_Products_EN.pdf">Samsung Electronics Standards for Control of Substances used in products</a>, which lists PFAS in its "Potentially Risk Substances" and PFHxA in its "Restricted Substances" list with a 25㎍/kg maximum; however, it lists July 2026–2027 as the implement date, so it's possible that it has been (or is currently) used in "skin contact textiles."</p><p>At the very least, it's comforting that the biggest smartwatch brands have recognized the dangers of toxic compounds in smartwatch straps and taken steps to remove them. It's possible that two of the PFAS-free fluoroelastomer bands in the 2023 study came from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-9-long-term-review">Apple Watch S9</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a>.</p><p>If your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android watch</a> comes from another brand, I still urge you not to worry prematurely. But most brands offer an easy way to swap out straps if you don't want to stress about it, and we do have guides on alternative bands — like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/best-samsung-galaxy-watch-7-bands">Galaxy Watch 7 bands</a> — if you want to shop around.</p>

<p>Practically every Sci-fi movie shows someone using a futuristic computer with a holographic display controlled by a wave of their hands. However, the practical use of these kinds of interfaces is extremely limited without one of our major senses: touch. While an sEMG band makes it possible to "feel" virtual buttons and objects via a built-in haptic engine, Meta has a much larger vision than that.</p><p>This is about ensuring that XR is as mind-blowing as the original iPhone when a proper pair of AR <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">smart glasses</a> is finally commercially available. We got a glimpse of that with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Meta Orion</a> at September's Meta Connect conference, and it's clear this band is the way Meta plans users to interact with all future AR glasses from the company.</p><p>The band is worn like a smartwatch but isn't used to tell time or track your heart rate. Instead, it helps make hand tracking more accurate and, most importantly, subtle, by sensing muscle movements and translating them into actions.</p><p>But the sEMG band isn't just an alternative input method. It's more private than voice input — especially in public places — and it allows you to keep your attention forward instead of on a physical device like a phone or keyboard. That's important in a world where people are constantly together but never <em>present</em>. It's the perfect way to control the next-generation pair of Meta smart glasses, and that's exactly what Meta's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/blog/quest/surface-emg-wrist-white-paper-reality-labs/">newly published white paper</a> details.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Using a pair of smart glasses without this band is akin to using a smartphone without a touch screen. It can work, but the experience isn't very good.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Meta's first major AR glasses prototype, Meta Orion, uses this kind of sEMG band and Meta fully believes it's a requirement for true AR smart glasses products scheduled to debut this year. Using a pair of smart glasses without this band is akin to using a smartphone without a touch screen. It can work, but the experience isn't very good.</p><p>I've seen this kind of band referred to as a "neural interface" before but I think that's really overselling it. Yes, the band can detect the electrical signals in your arm muscles to better understand how you want to interact with virtual objects, but it can't read your mind. If anything, neural interface makes the band sound creepy when it's really not.</p><p>In my demo, I was able to almost effortlessly scroll though song tracks by rubbing my thumb forward or backward on my index finger. It felt almost like I was using some kind of fidget roller to control an iPod, but no physical object was in my hand.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1523px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="YDydXNNsTRucGccbjJp8Sf" name="meta-semg-band-analysis" alt="A photo of a Meta sEMG band third-generation prototype with explanations of its anatomy" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YDydXNNsTRucGccbjJp8Sf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1523" height="857" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Scrolling though an Instagram feed was similarly simple, although that required a little more of my attention than Meta talks about in this white paper.</p><p>The sEMG band is vital for next generation virtual interfaces because it allows full input without a touchscreen or a set of cameras that can see your hands. That second part is most important because, if companies like Meta are going to launch a successful pair of smart glasses with a display, they'll need to cut out as much "fluff" technology as possible to make the glasses small and comfortable.</p><p>As Meta points out in the white paper, being able to control a pair of smart glasses even when your hands are full is a sort of holy Grail of device input. It could easily replace the smartphone experience because it's even more effortless, and we all know people love convenience and ease.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Being able to control a pair of smart glasses even when your hands are full is a sort of holy Grail of device input.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Because it doesn't require the use of a camera to detect movement, it's not subject to the same sort of tech bias that cameras can suffer from. There have been many examples of camera-controlled interfaces over the years that didn't perform as well for people with darker skin tones, but the sEMG won't have this problem.</p><p>The sEMG band I wore was extremely comfortable as it was made with stretchy, breathable fabric and fit very comfortably around my wrist. Unlike traditional EMG medical devices, it's completely non-invasive and feels no different from wearing a smartwatch. If anything, it's more comfortable than a smartwatch because the weight is evenly distributed all around the band.</p><p>Because you're not holding anything in your hand, using an sEMG band with something like smart glasses is more ergonomic than a smartphone. There's a reason "text neck" is a recognized medical condition and this could very well solve that problem entirely.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:51.25%;"><img id="qaMaCPW9bJQjEab4HLNnAR" name="meta-semg-band-gestures-optimized" alt="Examples of different hand gestures that the Meta sEMG band can recognize" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qaMaCPW9bJQjEab4HLNnAR.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="410" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>This is not a "brain-reading device" and cannot read your thoughts. It also cannot beam Zuck's thoughts (or anyone else's) into your head.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>A full-on pair of smart glasses like Meta Orion naturally have cameras built in that can track the environment around them, similar to a VR headset. These cameras can also be used for hand tracking, but hand tracking is usually a bit more of an active input type since the cameras actually have to be able to <em>see</em> your hands.</p><p>An sEMG band helps augment this by providing a secondary input based on wrist muscle movement. The band can detect the electrical impulses in your muscles and understands hundreds of different gestures because of it. It can even detect slight movements, allowing you to be extremely precise with input. The animated image above shows a real hand alongside what</p><p>Meta stresses that this is not a "brain-reading device" and that it cannot read your thoughts. As I said before, I thought it was a bit much when Mark Zuckerberg referred to it as a "neural interface" back at Connect. It's not. It also cannot beam Zuck's thoughts into your head which, apparently, some people were worried about or they wouldn't have mentioned it in the white paper.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2458px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="WpvXwse54duSGhfUix3cAh" name="meta-semg-band-compared-to-samsung-galaxy-ring" alt="A photo of a Samsung Galaxy Ring taken by Nicholas Sutrich next to an illustration of a Meta sEMG band provided by Meta" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WpvXwse54duSGhfUix3cAh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2458" height="1383" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich, Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>The sensors come in contact with the skin and read electrical signals in your wrist muscles in the same non-invasive way a smartwatch reads your pulse.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Meta also stresses that the sEMG is non-invasive which is important since clinical EMG technology <em>is</em> invasive. The inside of the band looks a lot like a smart ring, including sensors that slightly protrude. The version of the sEMG band I used was the third generation of its kind and looks substantially sleeker than the first two generations, both of which looked more like a smartwatch than anything else.</p><p>The sensors come in contact with the skin and read electrical signals in your wrist muscles much in the same way a smartwatch reads your pulse. They don't provide any sort of electrical stimulation or feedback. Rather, they are just used to read muscle movements and infer more accurate hand tracking data.</p><p>These types of sEMG bands are more attractive for mainstream adoption for a bevy of reasons. Outside of looking nice and being fully customizable, they don't look any different from a cloth or leather wristband that someone might wear to complete the look of an outfit.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vvq8PFe5YLqu8t8Hf6AJG6" name="meta-project-orion-ar-glasses-hands-on-ui-02.jpg" alt="A view of the multitasking UI inside Meta Orion AR Glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vvq8PFe5YLqu8t8Hf6AJG6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It also feels incredibly natural to interact with virtual interfaces when using an sEMG band thanks to the haptic feedback engine inside. This motor can vibrate and provide physical feedback based on what you touch, similar to how a virtual button on a smartphone display can feel more real when it vibrates correctly.</p><p>Touching floating buttons that don't exist can feel very strange on a Meta Quest headset because there's no feedback, but an sEMG band solves this problem. It's a huge win for the concept of floating virtual screens and UIs and would be a legitimate replacement for a tablet in many scenarios.</p><p>Meta doesn't have a timetable for when such a band would make it to market, but I'd be willing to hedge my bets that we'll see one alongside the launch of Meta's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/looks-like-ray-ban-meta-ar-glasses-are-getting-a-visual-upgrade">first pair of smartglasses with a display</a> sometime this year.</p>

<p>Samsung's S25 leaks are coming in hot as we are exactly one week away from the Unpacked event set for January 22. This time, we get to see high-quality images of the alleged S25 series.</p><p>The photos come from prominent tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/1879269291100647721">Evan Blass,</a> and they look like official promotional posters from Samsung, painting a picture of how the cameras on these devices will likely appear.</p><p>The first image shows the two devices, which seem to be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a> and S25 Plus models, in deep blue and silver color variants. The image gives us a close-up of the trio's cameras set up on the back, with black rims surrounding the cameras. (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/14/samsung-galaxy-s25-camera-design-leak/">9to5Google</a>).</p>

<p>The second image shows the S25 Ultra's design, a display showcasing thin bezels with rounded corners, and the first-ever look at the S Pen in the right corner of the product poster. The back of the device is shown with its rumored four-camera array and lenses that could have black rims. However, it is the first close-up of the lens with its new black rims.</p><p>Last week saw massive S25 leaks that gave us full renders of the series' trio along with the supposed spec sheet, leaving little to nothing to the imagination.</p><p>The Ultra is rumored to grab a 6.9-inch screen with a 120Hz refresh rate. For its cameras, the device could see a 200MP primary lens, a 50MP ultrawide-angle camera, a 50MP periscope telephoto camera, and a 10MP telephoto. The S25 and S25 Plus could see a 6.2-inch Full HD+ display and a 6.7-inch display, respectively. They will likely have a triple camera array featuring a 50MP primary camera, a 12MP ultrawide-angle camera, and a 10MP telephoto lens.</p><p>Both handsets will apparently have a 12MP selfie shooter on the front.</p>

<p>Additionally, within the image, a new AI feature was spotted that is said to come with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a>. The screen displays an interactive bar at the bottom, dubbed “Now Bar,” with the “Now Brief” prompt visible that reads "Get today's highlight."</p><p>Not much has been revealed about these features however, Samsung put out a<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/the-first-step-towards-true-ai-companion"> blog post</a> recently stating this feature will be the "defining element" of the new UI. Now Bar will give you a brief of your day (aka Now Brief), which is said to integrate into everyday actions and the most-used apps on the lock screen. The bar will give users personalized suggestions with regard to entertainment, directions to their next meeting, or even help with communicating in different languages.</p><p>Samsung S24 users got a little taste of what the new One UI 7 is capable of as the third beta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-s24-series-one-ui-7-beta-3-roll-out">rolled out </a>for them last week.</p><p>While we're seeing leaks come out in full swing, it's important to note that these features may or may not show up on the official device.

<ul><li>Google Home's Public Preview environment is preparing to deliver an update that expands support, features, and device control.</li><li>Enrolled testers will soon experiment with third-party Matter support for smart locks and the addition of Nest Protect CO/smoke alarms.</li><li>A recent Public Preview test brought "Gemini in Assistant" for Google's speakers, which lets users call out to the AI for answers.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is beginning to push the start of another Public Preview update that opens the doors to more device support and Matter.</p><p>As detailed in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.googlenestcommunity.com/t5/Blog/Introducing-new-support-for-smoke-amp-CO-and-locks-in-Google-Home-app/ba-p/669640">community post</a>, the Google Home Public Preview is preparing to rollout for CO/smoke alarms, smart locks through Matter, and Control settings. Beginning with Matter support, Google states it will soon open its doors to "new partners" with "more compatibility" in the Home app. Of course, this is thanks to the new smart home standard, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/matter">Matter</a>.</p><p>More specifically, the post states those enrolled in the app's Public Preview will begin noticing "feature enhancements" for third-party Matter smart locks. Those new features include "Passcode Management."</p><p>Household managers will soon find a complete, all-encompassing view of who has a passcode to a lock and their access status. Moreover, the company states that, as a manager, you will have the ability to set personal automations and see a "robust" history of events. Additionally, managers can create "guest passcodes" for people who require temporary access.</p><p>This feature is said to rollout out "this week" for Public Preview users on Android. Those on iOS will have to wait a little longer.</p><p>Next, Google is expanding the scope of its included Nest Protect devices to its CO and smoke alarms. As it arrives "this week," testers will find a new view for their alarms that include a general overview of a room's status. More importantly, if there is a situation and a camera is present, users can view that room directly to see where the fire or emergency is and take action.</p><p>The rest of the Nest Protect support includes the following:</p>
<ul><li>Receive emergency and heads-up notifications for smoke and carbon monoxide</li><li>Get critical status alerts like battery health or device issues</li><li>Modify your configuration: change system-wide and alarm-specific settings</li><li>E911 calling for Nest Aware subscribers (US only)- If you are a Nest Aware subscriber in the US, you can use the Google Home app to quickly contact an emergency call center close to your home, even if you’re not home.</li></ul>

<p>The Public Preview's upcoming addition of better control settings in the app are mostly quality of life changes for "one-tap entry" and "automatic locking." For the former, Google states users can choose this option, which will eliminate the need for entering in a passcode. Instead, users will need to tap lock or unlock using the app. Automatic locking will let users set a timer for a specific lock, letting it know how long it should remain open before locking down (literally).</p><p>Push notifications for lock events are also included, as well as a "Vacation mode" to give your smart locks even more security.</p><p>A recent Public Preview update for Google Home from December involved a strong look at "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/google-home-public-preview-gemini-in-assistant-test">Gemini in Assistant</a>." The AI concerned the company's smart Nest devices like the Nest Audio or the Nest Speaker Mini 2nd Gen. Testers could converse with the AI through these devices and receive answers about a range of topics. Essentially, it acts similar to the Gemini experience on your phone.</p><p>Another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-google-home-integration-public-preview-rollout">Gemini update</a> for Public Preview users included bringing it into the fold for your smart home accessories. Users could ask Gemini to close their blinds in a specific room and more, which sees the new AI model slowly replacing the brand's Assistant.</p>

<hr>
<p>A major Samsung leak seemingly involves its highly rumored "Slim" variant to the Galaxy S25 series.</p><p>Clear renders of the assumed Galaxy S25 Slim were discovered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/OnLeaks/status/1879599398625374691">OnLeaks</a> in conjunction with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/samsung-galaxy-s25-slim-shows-off-ultra-thin-design-exclusive-first-look/">SmartPrix</a>. The images suggest the device will have a pretty expected design as the Galaxy S25 Slims resembles what we've seen rumored for the Galaxy S25 and Galaxy S25 Plus. Strangely, the rumors don't purport the phone's display size; however, it does mention that the screen is completely flat.</p><p>The provided renders also show that the sides of the phone have the potential to be flat, as well.</p><p>What the publication highlights after is the supposed thinness of the phone, which is allegedly 6.4mm without factoring in the camera bump. The tipster's discovery suggests the phone's measurements, which are reportedly 159x76x6.4mm.</p><p>The post purports that the Galaxy S25 Slim will be roughly "1.6mm narrower, 3.8mm shorter, and 1.8mm thinner" than the upcoming S25 Ultra.</p><p>Internally, rumors suggest Samsung will keep the Qualcomm trend and place the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> inside the S25 Slim. The SoC lends strength to a device's on-device AI, tasks for gaming and more, but it also bolsters a device's cameras.</p><p>That rolls us into Slim's supposed triple vertical camera array on a "glass back" panel. The renderings show that Samsung might deploy the same style of camera lenses that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/major-galaxy-s25-series-rendering-design-leak">we've seen leaked</a> for its other Galaxy S25 phones. The publication claims the phone will utilize three cameras: a 200MP primary lens, a 50MP ultra-wide lens, and a 50MP ALoP telephoto camera with 3.5x zoom.</p>

<p>Other rumored specifications include the S25 Slim's 12GB of RAM. The renders show that Samsung will place the USB-C charging port and speaker on the bottom of the phone, to no one's surprise. Additionally, the latest renderings/rumors fail to mention a battery size.</p><p>The post simply states the S25 Slim will feature a "larger battery" that's over 3,050mAh.</p><p>These renders surface five days after the Galaxy S25 Slim was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-slim-geekbench-test">reportedly spotted on Geekbench</a>. The listing seemingly doubles down on what's been rumored today with the device's 12GB of RAM and the Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC. The Geekbench data shows that the phone will likely run One UI 7 (Android 15), which we're also expecting.</p><p>What's more, the rumors mention Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-telephoto-camera-module-alop-detailed">ALoP camera technology</a>. This is something the company discussed last November, which is something that could positively affect the future of Galaxy phone camera modules. Putting it plainly, ALoP (All Lenses on Prism) places the lenses "horizontally" inside the module, instead of vertically, which saves on a massive camera bump.</p><p>With Samsung in its thin phone era, this seems like a smart move. Though, it doesn't seem like the ALoP tech will be implemented across the entire array.</p><p>Rumors have continuously suggested the phone <em>could </em>debut sometime in Q2 2025. That gives us a window between April and June.</p><p>For now, we have the flagship trio to look forward to on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">January 22 at Unpacked</a>.

The program may not reach North American shores until later this year, but it&apos;s great news if you plan to buy a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> in 2025. </p>

<p>Previously, you had to buy a new phone if you wanted to receive trade-in credit from Samsung, which was a hassle if you were simply hoping to ditch an old device (or if you wanted to switch to a non-Samsung phone). Now, thanks to this update, you&apos;ll be able to get cold hard cash in exchange for your trade-ins, any time of year and anywhere in the world.</p>

<hr>
<p>The onslaught of early Galaxy S25 glimpses keeps coming but, this time, a retailer has seemingly slipped up.</p><p>A retail listing for a slew of the Galaxy S25 series' cases were accidentally posted on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.powerbuy.co.th/en/category/phone-and-tablet/phone-and-tablet-accessories/cases-and-films?fill=1-0%7C2-0&page=4&ship=0">PowerBuy</a> (Thailand), spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MaxJmb/status/1879516349191643627">Max Jambor</a> on X. To be clear, it seems the retailer noticed its mistake and removed the upcoming Galaxy series case; however, it wasn't fast enough. Jambor was able to snap a screenshot of the cases, giving us a clear (tiny) look at what's to come.</p><p>The case on deck seem relatively tame compared to Samsung's recent past. The Galaxy S25 Ultra had a listing for a "Standing Grip Case," which its predecessor, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">the S24 Ultra</a>, also had. PowerBuy's retail data shows that the case will arrive in the following colors: gray, black, and white. The cases seem pretty close to what Samsung dropped last year as the "standing grip" part shifts down to accommodate your hand — and to stand — with a colored underside.</p><p>However, a clear difference is with the camera lens cutout. Instead of seamlessly hugging the lenses, due to the device's rumors camera design change, it appears raised.</p><p>The vertical, pill-shaped cutout acts more like a slot for the <em>entire </em>array, instead of the lenses individually. Its a design that looks like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, if we're honest.</p><p>The listing also showed the same Standing Grip Case for the Galaxy S25 Plus in gray and white. Additionally, the device's basic silicone case was also leaked. The case is basic as it lacks the grip portion. What remains the same is the new cutout for the lenses which, again, do not hug the lenses individually.</p><p>The base Galaxy S25 also appeared, but with only a silicone case in black, light blue, mint, blue, and red.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:660px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:90.91%;"><img id="SdZP3ost72HeDAQWXxw9pf" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-series-case-retail-leak" alt="A screenshot of a "Standing Grip Case" for the Galaxy S25 Ultra and S25 Plus, as well as basic silicone cases for the Galaxy S25." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SdZP3ost72HeDAQWXxw9pf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="660" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Max Jambor / X)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Thailand-based website listed the grip case for 1,390 baht, which is roughly $40. The basic silicone case was listed for 890 baht, ~$28. It's worth keeping in mind that these conversions are rough estimates, meaning Samsung will undoubtedly alter these prices depending on the region. For now, these could serve as food for thought.</p><p>A good case is important, but what's also notable are the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/major-galaxy-s25-series-rendering-design-leak">recently leaked renderings</a> of the Galaxy S25 series ahead of launch. The leak left nothing to the imagination as we got a clear look at the rumored changes for the Galaxy S25 Ultra. The devices seemingly sports rounded corners, a completely flat display with thin bezels, and an altered camera array design.</p><p>With black rings surrounding the lenses, the upcoming series will look closer to the Fold 6.</p><p>Early alleged looks at the Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus were also detailed; however, those devices look pretty similar to Samsung's recent history. These renderings surfaced quite quickly after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-specs-leak">the entire specification sheet</a> was reportedly discovered, detailing the Ultra's 6.9-inch display and more.</p><p>Samsung has confirmed that it will reveal the Galaxy S25 series <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">on January 22</a> during Unpacked.

<ul><li>Samsung recently teased a new "multimodal" change for Galaxy AI's Sketch to Image, courtesy of its One UI 7 software.</li><li>The feature will let users draw with an S Pen or type an image description, as well as use "voice commands" with the AI drawing assist.</li><li>Samsung claimed this was part of creating a "true AI companion," which was highlighted in a recent teaser short.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung continues to intensify discussions about its next Galaxy S25 series and today (Jan 15), the company is teasing new Galaxy AI-powered additions.</p><p>The Korean OEM has been developing One UI 7 (Android 15) for quite some time and a recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/how-a-true-ai-companion-can-unleash-your-creativity">Newsroom post</a> highlighted a major AI update. Specifically, this update reportedly pertains to users with an S Pen, meaning this will likely include the Galaxy S25 Ultra and, perhaps, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">S24 Ultra</a>. The blog post teases a new update for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-sketch-to-image-on-a-samsung-galaxy-phone">Sketch to Image</a>, Samsung's AI-backed drawing assistor for turning any drawing into a high-quality image.</p><p>This update will bring more ways for users to get their thoughts down on the screen. According to Samsung, users will soon be able to sketch using an S Pen, speak their drawing into being using "voice commands," or write a description of their image for the AI to create.</p><p>Additionally, Samsung states users don't have to feel restricted to one choice or the other. Through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a>, Galaxy AI will let users combine a brief sketch alongside a text description of additional details — incase you can't really visualize what you want.</p><p>Samsung states Galaxy AI will take over, combining your drawn portion with the description to generate an image.</p><p>The company then states this update will be brought to users by its One UI 7 update, which leans heavily on the idea of becoming "multimodal." The post teases that the software can "understand natural language through text, speech, and images." There's seemingly more on the horizon for the upcoming Galaxy S25 series during its Unpacked debut.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:904px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.37%;"><img id="W7Va6A7Dg4dqSt87nAqK3T" name="samsung-galaxy-ai-sketch-to-image-one-ui-7-changes" alt="An image of Samsung's "Sketch to Image" feature, which will receive updates through One UI 7 to become more "multimodal."" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/W7Va6A7Dg4dqSt87nAqK3T.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="904" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Sketch to Image is wrapped in Samsung's Galaxy AI package, which arrived last summer. It's worth noting that users with a Galaxy Z Fold 6 or Flip 6 can activate this handy tool through "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/how-a-true-ai-companion-can-unleash-your-creativity">Drawing Assist</a>," which is the overall AI function. Aside from drawing, users can tell the AI which style they prefer, like Watercolor, Illustration, Sketch, Pop Art, or 3D Cartoon.</p><p>While Sketch to Image originally launched on Samsung's recent foldables, it seems the company is eyeing other S Pen-capable phones, too. The Ultra models are, of course, topping that list, but how far that support will stretch is uncertain. It was made obvious that Galaxy AI is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-ai-more-past-gen-confirmed">heavily dependant a device's hardware</a>, so there's a chance these advancements might not have much wiggle room.</p><p>Samsung's recent Sketch to Image teaser — again — highlights its interest in a "true AI companion." The Korean OEM recently uploaded a short teaser video of that idea, which might've alluded to our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-potential-bixby-upgrade-unpacked-teaser">expected Bixby upgrades</a>. The teaser shows a person asking the AI to find a specific restaurant and send that information to another person, as well as their calendar.</p><p>All of it was done without pause, which lends to Samsung's interest in creating AI that can understand natural speech.</p><p>Either way, we don't have much longer to wait as Samsung will reveal its Galaxy S25 series, One UI 7, and Galaxy AI features <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">on January 22</a>.

<ul><li>Samsung is launching the Galaxy S25 series on January 22.</li><li>All three models will likely have preorders on the launch day and are tipped to be delivered on February 3.</li><li>The trio's regular sales are expected to begin by February 9, at least for the Indian market.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The debut of the Samsung Galaxy S25 series is merely a week away. Ahead of the release, we have already started seeing leaked official teasers, and a new leak now indicates the devices' sales and availability in the Indian market.</p><p>The leak comes from Ishan Agarwal on X, where the tipster has shared (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s25-sale-delivery-dates-india-leak/">SamMobile</a>) the availability of the Galaxy S25 series in the Indian market. While pre-orders are expected during the January 22 launch, according to Agarwal, devices will be delivered around February 3, followed by sales by February 9.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Exclusive: After pre-orders, Samsung Galaxy S25 series deliveries will start in 🇮🇳 India around Feb 3rd & sales by Feb 9th.Colours & variants for India ⬇️S25 Ultra:(256GB, 512GB, 1TB)- Titanium Gray- Titanium Black- Titanium Silver Blue- Titanium Pink Gold- Titanium…<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1879055116721852767">January 14, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>The tipster has also shared the color variants and storage options that users can expect from the Galaxy S25 series, including the Galaxy S25, S25 Plus, and Galaxy S25 Ultra. The latter is likely to ship in 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB storage variants.</p><p>As for the colorways, users can expect the S25 Ultra in Titanium Black, Titanium Silver Blue, Titanium Pink Gold, Titanium White Silver, Titanium Jade Green, and Titanium Jet Black. These presumably include offline and exclusive online color options.</p><p>On the other hand, the standard Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus are expected to be seen in Silver Shadow, Pink Gold, Coral Red, Mint, Navy/ Icy Blue, and Blue Black. And these handsets will likely stick to 256GB and 512GB storage options.</p>

Another recent tip has shown us every possible colour variant of the Galaxy S25, S25 Plus, and Galaxy S25 Ultra via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/major-galaxy-s25-series-rendering-design-leak">official-looking renders</a>.

<p>Some lucky YouTube Premium users are getting $100 off the Google Pixel 9 series, making these <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship phones</a> even harder to resist.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/14/pixel-9-youtube-premium/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, a number of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-premium">YouTube Premium</a> subscribers in the U.S. are getting promo codes via email for big savings. Notably, this discount is stackable, meaning it can be combined with the current promotional offerings available on the Google Store.</p><p>9to5 previously reported that the Google Store was already knocking $150 off the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a>, 9 Pro, and 9 Pro XL, and $300 off the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>. Throw in the extra savings, and you’re looking at some seriously sweet deals on these flagship phones.</p><p>As a result, these codes slash $250 off the Pixel 9, 9 Pro, and 9 Pro XL—or a hefty $400 off the 9 Pro Fold if you’re eyeing the foldable option.</p><p>If you’re thinking about upgrading, now’s the perfect time. The deal is not available to everyone, though, and we’re not sure who exactly qualifies, so check your inbox if you’re a YouTube Premium subscriber.</p><p>Meanwhile, if you didn’t get the offer, the regular $150 discount is still a solid deal. It keeps the Pixel 9 series a top choice for anyone after a premium phone experience.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1339px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:129.65%;"><img id="KkG5kJ9zoFxtnJbdVqWThn" name="Youtube-premium-email-Pixel-9-deal" alt="Pixel 9 promo code sent via email to YouTube Premium users" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KkG5kJ9zoFxtnJbdVqWThn.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1339" height="1736" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The email says that this offer is only good until January 25, and the promo code can only be used on the Google Store. So, if you usually shop in places like Amazon or Best Buy, that might be a bit of a downside.</p><p>The Pixel 9 series is a big win for Google, offering a top-notch user experience that’s totally worth the price. With its excellent hardware and smooth software, it’s a standout device. Snagging one at a discount is a smart way to get great value for the long haul.</p>

<p>Google successfully turned Android smartwatches into a success story by co-developing Wear OS with Samsung hardware and Qualcomm silicon, saving the brand from years of mediocrity. Now it looks like Android XR will rely on the same partners and path to success. But the road will be an uphill battle.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a>, Google's new platform for XR headsets and smart glasses, will launch with a Samsung headset and Snapdragon chip in 2025. Just like Google let Samsung sell its Galaxy Watch with Wear OS well before it sold its first Pixel Watch, Google is trusting Samsung to spread Android XR to consumers in a way it can't by itself.</p><p>This is a relief for anyone who wants Android XR to succeed. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://killedbygoogle.com/">Google Graveyard</a> is full of promising XR projects: Google Daydream, Google Cardboard, and Google Glass are the major names, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/googles-parent-company-reportedly-buying-ar-smart-glasses-maker-north">Focals AR project</a> and apps like VR180 Creator also killed off. Samsung's presence is the X factor that'll keep Android XR alive a little longer.</p><p>But even with Samsung at the helm, Android XR headsets need to solve challenges like battery life, comfortable and stylish designs, accessible controls, and other common industry problems. Thankfully, Samsung and Google spent the last decade solving similar issues in Android watches! So there's reason for optimism.</p>
<h2 id="android-xr-will-face-very-similar-challenges-to-wear-os-2">Android XR will face VERY similar challenges to Wear OS</h2>
<p>Smartwatches have existed for a decade, but their problems haven't changed. Most can't last longer than a day or two because brands use annual efficiency upgrades to pack in new features and keep new buyers entertained. Small displays make using apps less appealing than on phones, and AI assistant commands are limited unless they pull data from your phone (which takes time).</p><p>XR headsets, AR glasses, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">smart glasses</a> all have similar "wearable" problems that Android XR will have to solve.</p><p>Let's start with battery life. Most headsets and glasses can't solve this portability problem, so they wire up to a PC, console, or puck, which isn't especially comfortable or natural. Meta Quest is the popular exception, but its last few headsets all have the same suboptimal 2-hour battery life because they had to prioritize better graphics on the new generation over longevity.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Ynuoir6wBUdePdHywfUwfG" name="android-xr-smart-glasses-concept-02" alt="A lifestyle image showing off a prototype pair of smart glasses powered by Android XR" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ynuoir6wBUdePdHywfUwfG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>And that's with a pound of plastic to work with; finding somewhere to squeeze a battery into a stylish glasses frame people would wear outdoors without embarrassment is a challenge.</p><p>That's why <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta glasses</a> last four hours without any display tech, and most AR glasses prototypes either use a wire or last less than an hour. Meta says its thick <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Orion glasses</a> will have "all-day battery life" in 2027 with a wireless puck to handle the power, but we'll wait to see that in practice, and they're on the borderline of being able to "blend in" as normal glasses.</p><p>Google can show stylish Android XR prototypes like the photo above, but can it (or Samsung) actually deliver all-day Gemini in something that skinny? Especially with <em>on-device</em> Gemini commands? That's the initial challenge, and it's one most early smartwatches struggled with, with their bulky and techy or cheap band designs and poor longevity.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nxuFMJF3BJrHA62DcyLxTf" name="Android-XR-circle-to-search-chrome" alt="A mock-up of Android XR showing floating Chrome screens in a mixed-reality space, visible on top of a living room.

<p>Then there's the <em>purpose</em> of these devices. An XR productivity headset like Project Moohan (or Apple Vision Pro) is supposed to replace or supplement your laptop as an extended display, while smart/AR glasses are supposed to give you AI insights and photography with your phone in your pocket. They're designed to convince you that your current work setup or phone use isn't good enough, and that's a tall bar to clear with expensive first-generation tech.</p><p>Smartwatches have become extremely popular, but early models like the original Galaxy Gear were deficient, miniature clones of phones with substandard apps and tiny screens. Non-techies didn't understand why they were relevant to their daily lives, and even now, people love watches for their notifications and fitness tools, but many people <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/using-google-keep-and-recorder-app-on-pixel-watch">don't bother using the actual <em>apps</em></a> when their phone is right there.</p><p>Android XR's "purpose" could be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini AI</a>. If smart glasses can use sensors to respond to your surroundings and hold a real-time conversation about what you see and hear, that will have an immediate appeal to a wide consumer base, especially younger generations growing up with AI as a main knowledge source.</p><p>The question will be if Google and Samsung can deliver Gemini AI in a compact form factor with enough tokens for intelligent responses, without wrecking the battery life. Presumably, your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> could handle the CPU brunt, but the glasses would still need to process the multimodal info necessary for your phone to deliver intelligent responses, and that could mean a significant (and annoying) delay.</p><p>Google and Samsung are <em>still</em> trying to figure out the efficiency equation for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a>, but they've definitely improved. They'll need to channel that expertise into early Android XR products if they want to succeed.</p>
<h2 id="project-moohan-will-make-or-break-android-xr-2">Project Moohan will make or break Android XR</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5120px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:52.73%;"><img id="GDvSEctRTR7cSxxZmNyABX" name="Samsung-Project-Moohan-Side-render" alt="An official product render of Samsung's Project Moohan VR headset" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GDvSEctRTR7cSxxZmNyABX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5120" height="2700" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Samsung's 2025 XR headset, codenamed Project Moohan </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung and Oculus collaborated closely in the latter's early days; the Galaxy phone-powered Gear VR with Oculus software was the result. Samsung even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-opening-production-studio-new-york-vr-content">founded a VR movie studio</a> around that time. But the partnership fizzled as Oculus (later Meta's Reality Labs) pivoted to its own all-in-one headsets like the Oculus Go and Quest, and Samsung let its VR plans fade.</p><p>I suspect Samsung's virtual ambitions were fully reborn once it heard about the Apple Vision Pro, but if not for Zuckerberg's Metaverse ambitions, Samsung might have stayed in the VR space. Or it could have abandoned it like Google did when it realized VR wouldn't be as profitable as originally hoped. It's hard to say.</p><p>Project Moohan, the 2025 headset with a Snapdragon XR2 Plus Gen 2 chip and Google's OS, will probably feel like making up for a lost opportunity for Samsung execs. However, its success will depend on a few factors like pricing, comfort, gaming, and audience.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="4RfgxtFQxgSCTz5o6LSq3j" name="Headset_GooglePhotos-project-moohan-android-xr" alt="Running Google Photos in mixed reality on Samsung Project Moohan, powered by Android XR" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4RfgxtFQxgSCTz5o6LSq3j.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="281" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Google Photos app on Project Moohan </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Meta Quest headsets are the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-vr-headsets">best VR headsets</a> because of their wireless accessibility, affordability, and constant updates from the Reality Labs team. Meta has specific initiatives like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oculus-publishing-announcement">Oculus Publishing</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developers.meta.com/horizon/blog/introducing-oculus-publishing-ignition-a-new-multi-million-dollar-prototyping-fund/?locale=tr_TR">Publishing Ignite</a> that share Meta's resources with smaller game developers. Most VR fans have built up their libraries on Quest over the last few years.</p><p>Samsung and Google told us that they intend to make gaming a major focal point of Android XR, avoiding Apple's productivity-only stance. But it could be an uphill battle to get VR gamers onto a new platform unless they see exclusives and investment; the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/sony-no-longer-cares-about-the-psvr-2-and-you-shouldnt-either">mostly-abandoned PSVR 2</a> is evidence of that.</p><p>On the productivity side, Samsung will undercut the $3,500 Apple Vision Pro; I can't imagine Project Moohan costing <em>half</em> that. It'll certainly have productivity apps like Google Drive, Gmail, and Adobe CC to attract interest. My question is whether there are that many graphic artists and other creative types willing to wear a VR headset as a laptop replacement for hours a day who haven't <em>already</em> bought a Vision Pro.</p><p>If Samsung can discover that XR niche between Meta and Apple, I'd say the market is ready for more competition. However, the example of Meta, which loses billions per year on Reality Labs despite strong sales, makes me wonder whether Samsung will be satisfied with <em>whatever</em> Moohan sells.</p>
<h2 id="the-key-is-patience-2">The key is patience</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="PqXZpoB9SLWbgwNXTMhvZh" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-3-app-drawer" alt="The Wear OS 5 app drawer on the Google Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PqXZpoB9SLWbgwNXTMhvZh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google won't kill Android XR as long as Samsung is invested. In fact, it may be a good thing that Google <em>isn't</em> selling XR hardware anytime soon. Google can't prematurely pull the plug as easily without looking flaky to major partners, and Samsung has global reach to spread XR hardware where Pixel devices don't sell.</p><p>If Samsung gives up, I can't envision Google sticking around for long. Tech companies are all about efficiency and maximizing profits for shareholders these days, and Google and Samsung will have to justify any XR losses four times a year until it pays off.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr-is-the-most-exciting-new-version-of-android-in-years">Android XR sure sounds promising</a> when you see concept videos for Google Maps holograms, real-time text translation, 3D films, and so on. But whether we're talking about headsets, glasses, watches, or even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">smart rings</a>, all wearables need to nail the balance between style, comfort, battery life, and seamless controls. Samsung has the talent and Google's backing to pull that off, but it may take a few generations.</p><p>Will Google and Samsung have the patience to iterate and find their audience, as they did with smartwatches? Time will tell!</p>

<p>By the time I actually got the Z Fold 6, I was too busy to use it — between the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review">Honor Magic V3</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a>, it was quite the hectic launch season at the end of 2024.

I wasn't keen on the boxy design, but it isn't as much of a hindrance on a foldable, and the Z Fold 6 isn't uncomfortable to hold. It is heavier and bulkier than the Magic V3, but it isn't anywhere as unwieldy as the Z Fold 5. If anything, the design makes it easier to slot the device into a mobile gaming controller, and that is a definite plus point.</p>

<p>The inner 7.6-inch AMOLED panel is among the best on a foldable, and it's well-suited to extended Balatro sessions (or any other game). I didn't run into any issues with the hardware either, and although it tends to throttle earlier than regular phones, that's the case with other foldables as well, so the Z Fold 6 isn't an outlier in this regard. <br><br>The hinge is smoother this time around, and it has better articulation. The crease continues to be visible — more so than other devices I tested recently — but again, it is much better its predecessors. My biggest bugbear with the Z Fold 6 is that the outer screen still isn't as wide as other devices; it's definitely an improvement over the Fold 4, but the 6.3-inch panel is nowhere as usable as the Pixel 9 Pro Fold or the Magic V3.</p>

<p>Another annoyance is that the cameras aren't as good as the X Fold3 or Magic V3, and you don't get much in the way of versatility. The X Fold3 and even 2023's OnePlus Open take much better photos in challenging conditions, and Samsung is clearly lagging behind in this area. <br><br>The redeeming factor is the software. Samsung continues to deliver useful software features on its foldables, and the Z Fold 6 does a great job with the basics. I'm not keen on Galaxy AI, but I'll admit that Samsung has one of the strongest AI-assisted software suites around, and it is bested only by Pixels.</p>

<p>On the whole, I can see how the Z Fold 6 is an enticing option if you're coming from an older foldable, or if you've used regular Samsung phones and are mulling a switch. Although there aren't huge upgrades this time around, the litany of small tweaks make it a better overall device than the Z Fold 5. <br><br>That said, it's far from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">best foldable</a> around, and Samsung needs to address issues with the cameras and cover screen. However, Samsung doesn't have any meaningful competition in the U.S., and unless that changes, I don't see the Korean manufacturer making any tangible improvements to its foldable — there's just no incentive to do so.</p>

<ul><li>Honor is bringing the Magic 7 Pro to Europe early this year, with key upgrades over the Magic 6 Pro.</li><li>The phone features a Snapdragon 8 Elite processor with new AI features, plus familiar ones like Gemini.</li><li>It sports a triple-camera system on the rear with a 200MP telephoto lens.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>After launching in China last year, Honor is bringing the Magic 7 Pro to Europe. The brand's high-end flagship is available for pre-order starting today in the United Kingdom. It'll cost £1,099.99, and features Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, a 200MP telephoto camera, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">IP68/69 durability ratings</a>.</p><p>The smartphone is slightly different from the China model that debuted in November 2024. That version of the Honor Magic 7 Pro is equipped with a 5,850mAh silicon-carbon battery. Meanwhile, the E.U. model of the Magic 7 Pro uses the same battery technology with a smaller 5,270mAh capacity. Compared to lithium-ion batteries, Honor's third-gen silicon-carbon batteries provide higher capacities in smaller sizes, allowing the Magic 7 Pro to measure 8.8mm thick.</p><p>The availability of the Magic 7 Pro in Europe marks the earliest we've seen an Honor flagship release globally in recent years. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-review">Honor Magic 6 Pro</a> didn't arrive in Europe until Mobile World Congress last year, which is still well over a month away.</p><p>At the heart of the Honor Magic 7 Pro is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> processor. It's a beastly chip that uses Qualcomm's custom Oryon cores it developed for the Snapdragon X family of laptop processors. This enables Honor to provide features like AI Real-Time Rendering and AI Predictive Scheduling Engine, which "delivers PC-level graphics," the company claims.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Anqnnqgm4K2Upa6ev4RY28" name="qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-02" alt="A Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite placard at a press event" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Anqnnqgm4K2Upa6ev4RY28.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Like any of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best smartphones in 2025</a>, the Magic 7 Pro is full of AI. There are Google staples, like Circle to Search and Gemini, plus some of Honor's own tricks. AI Super Zoom aims to provide passable photos at up to 100x zoom, AI Motion Sensing Capture will snap pictures when a subject moves, and Honor Notes can summarize your recordings. Some of these features are handled on-device, and others tap into Honor's servers in Europe for more demanding tasks.</p><p>The 6.8-inch screen, like past Honor flagships, prioritizes eye care. The company calls this the "Natural Light HONOR AI Eye Comfort Display," and uses high PWM rates and natural tones to make the display easier on the eyes. There's also a pill-shaped front facing camera cutout housing a 50MP wide camera.</p><p>Finally, the main Honor Magic 7 Pro camera is a 50MP, f/1.4 to f/2.0 adjustable aperture sensor with optical image stabilization. There's a 200MP periscope telephoto camera with 3x optical zoom and a 50MP wide camera with a 122-degree field-of-view.</p><p>The Magic 7 Pro will be available in the U.K. starting at £1,099.99, and in the rest of Europe for €1,299.99. Separately, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-unveils-the-magic-7-lite-in-europe-with-an-industry-first-battery-tech">Honor Magic 7 Lite</a> is available starting today for £399.99 as a budget alternative.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-47">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Android 15 already revamped the volume UI, but Android 16 might take it further with thinner sliders and clearer handles.</li><li>The new design follows Material Design principles, with a vertical bar showing the volume.</li><li>The slider is more angular now, with a solid handle line for better clarity, replacing the old rounded bubbles.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The Android 16 beta is expected to arrive in the next few months, and Google appears to be cooking up a few changes, including a fresh volume control design.</p><p>Android 15 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-volume-panel-redesign-collapsible">already gave your phone’s volume UI a makeover</a>, but Mishaal Rahman from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-16-volume-redesign-3516082/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> found even more tweaks in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-developer-preview-2-released">Android 16 developer preview 2</a>.</p><p>The new interface hints that Google might be ditching the pill-shaped volume sliders from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a>. Instead, we could see thinner sliders with clear handles.</p><p>It is much more in line with modern <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m3.material.io/components/sliders/overview" target="_blank">Material Design principles</a>. Google is aiming for a cleaner look, where a vertical bar shows the slider’s position, with one side darkened and the other left blank. A small dot at one end of the slider marks the max value.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Rahman’s visuals reflect just that, showing a more angular volume slider design. The new sliders end with a solid handle line, making it much clearer where the volume is set. This is a big upgrade from the old rounded bubbles, which could make it hard to tell the exact volume level.</p>

<p>This new volume slider design will show up in several places. You’ll see it in the horizontal volume pop-up menu and in the quick-access slider that pops up when you press the physical volume buttons.</p><p>There are also some shifts in how UI elements are placed. The music note icon, which used to move with the volume level, now stays fixed at the bottom of the slider. Meanwhile, the three-dot icon for the overflow volume panel looks a bit smaller than before.</p><p>As for when we might expect the volume UI change, it is still up in the air. It’s just been spotted in Developer Preview 2, so it could either get more tweaks and show up in the next preview, be added to the final release after more testing, or even get scrapped entirely.</p><p>This kind of uncertainty is pretty common early in Android’s development, since Google often experiments with UI ideas that don’t always make it to the final version. So, while the new slider looks promising, its future is still not guaranteed.</p>

<hr>
<p>Smartphone sales have finally shot up after a two-year slump. According to a recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/insight/post-insight-research-notes-blogs-smartphone-market-recovers-in-2024-after-two-years-of-decline/" target="_blank">report</a> by Counterpoint, the sales of smartphones grew by 4% YoY (33%) in 2024 when compared to the previous year.</p><p>As for what brought in the sudden shift in the numbers, Tarun Pathak, research director at Counterpoint Research, contributed to overall economic growth in Europe, China, and Latin America, meaning more people could afford to buy new phones.</p><p>"The smartphone market started showing signs of recovery from Q4 2023 and has now grown for five consecutive quarters," Pathak added in the report.</p><p>Xiaomi, even though it came third, took the lead as the fastest-growing smartphone brand among the top five in 2024, with an overall growth of 12% when compared to the previous year. The report stated that this growth was solely due to the company's "portfolio realignment, premium push, and aggressive expansion activities."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:985px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:68.43%;"><img id="S5ES442LFyz8HvLvSP2Bhn" name="Smartphone-sales-2024" alt="Table shows smartphone sales YoY 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/S5ES442LFyz8HvLvSP2Bhn.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="985" height="674" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: CounterPoint)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As for Samsung, the company did see a 1% fall in its overall sales but continued to lead (19% overall sales) the market in 2024. Samsung got to stick around at the top, thanks to the rising demand for its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">S24 series</a>, especially in the USA and Western Europe. Part of it was because the S24 was the company's first flagship to come with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>, bringing in a host of new capabilities, helping it "outperform its predecessors." It remains to be seen how much the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25"> </a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy S25 series</a> could bump up Samsung sales this year.</p><p>Taking second place is Apple,  with 18% of the share coming from Apple’s iPhone 16 series. The report further added that this series was met with mixed reactions due to the lack of Apple intelligence at the launch. Nevertheless, it did see enough growth in non-core markets like Latin America, Africa, and Asia-Pacific to score second place.</p>
<p>OPPO took fourth place, with an 8% YoY decline, and Vivo, even though it took fifth place, ended the year on a high note as the top-ranked OEM in India and China. Huawei, HONOR, and Motorola were ranked among the fastest-growing OEMs among all the top 10 brands.</p><p>The past year also saw the rollout of more generative AI (Gen AI) in smartphones— limited mostly to higher-end phones. However, Counterpoint Research predicts that by 2028, nine out of 10 smartphones over $250 (mid-range) will have Gen AI built into them.</p><p>As for how the market could look in 2025, the report says that despite numbers possibly never matching pre-pandemic times, "revenue growth is set to continue to outpace volume growth, with revenues growing 8% YoY, compared to 4% volume growth."</p>

<hr>
<p>New Year, new wave of phones; and a recent leak might've caught Motorola's next foldable earlier than usual.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/possible-motorola-razr-60-ultra-bis-certified-launch-india/">91Mobiles</a>, a phone was spotted moving through the BIS database in India, which the publication speculates is the "Razr 60 Ultra" (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2025/01/motorola-razr-60-ultra-closer-to-launch-certification.html">Android Headlines</a>). The post notes that the device was spotted with the model number <strong>XT2551</strong>, which could give credit to this rumor of it being the next Razr Plus for 2025.</p><p>Last year's model received XT2451, so it seems that Motorola has taken that third number up a level to indicate the next generation.</p><p>Unfortunately, the leaks end there, but it does create quite a curious situation as things are seemingly occurring in reverse order.</p>

<p>Last year, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-alleged-leaked-render">a rendering</a> of the Razr 50 Ultra, otherwise known as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus 2024</a> in the U.S., surfaced. This was then followed up by a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-50-ultra-aka-razr-plus-2024-live-image">set of live images</a> of the device as it moved through the standard certification databases. These events took place in January before a drought until April and May ahead of its official reveal that summer in July.</p><p>More importantly, it's worth noting that the time difference between the phone's BIS appearance and launch was three months.</p><p>The publication also noted that, suggesting that the Razr 60 Ultra (or the Razr Plus 2025) could see a much earlier launch. <em>If </em>— and it's a big if — this device is the next Motorola clamshell foldable, then we <em>could </em>be looking at an April release instead of a summer bash.</p><p>Right now, all of this is speculation, so it's wise to take things with a grain of salt as nothing further has been discovered/purported.</p><p>The publication also speculates that the phone could leverage Qualcomm's recently rumored "Snapdragon 8s Elite" since its predecessor uses the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8s-gen-3-announced">Snapdragon 8s Gen 3</a>. Speaking of the rumored 8s Elite, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8s-elite-cores-power-leak">its latest leak</a> might've put its core configuration into a toned-down perspective.</p><p>A Weibo tipster claims the chip could grab the same 1+3+2+2 config as the old flagship 8 Gen 3. Moreover, it could feature one Prime core at 3.21GHz. The current line of rumors says the chip will be weaker than the 8 Elite and the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, which lines up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8s-elite-power-changes-rumored">with ones from December</a>.</p><p>Tipsters purport the 8s Elite could debut sometime in Q1 2025.</p>

<hr>
<p>Our typical top-of-the-line flagships received the Snapdragon 8 Elite, but Qualcomm is reportedly working on a lesser-strength twin.</p><p>Rumors about such a reduced-powered SoC stem from Digital Chat Station (DCS) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/P9n8Zy7UB">on Weibo</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-8s-elite-leaked-specs-3516209/">Android Authority</a>). According to the leak, the tipster claims the new chip will be called the "Snapdragon 8s Elite" and it <em>could </em>see a 1+3+2+2 core configuration.</p><p>DCS went into those alleged specs, stating the SoC could see one core — which is speculated to be a Prime core — at 3.21GHz.</p><p>The post adds that the 8s Elite could hold three cores at 3.01GHz, two cores at 2.80GHz, and two additional cores at 2.02GHz. DCS purports that the 8s Elite will be joined by the Adreno 825 GPU. Interestingly, the alleged 8s Elite has already gone through Geekbench for performance scoring.</p><p>DCS states the early power specifications show that the chip achieved a score of 1,967 for its single-core and 5,827 during the multi-core stage. For context, the tipster compared it to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3-launch">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> from 2023, which achieved 2,200 and 7,000 scores, respectively.</p>

<p>Curiously, this isn't the first time <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8s-elite-power-changes-rumored">we've heard rumors</a> suggesting the "8s Elite" will be weaker than the 8 Elite <em>and </em>the 8 Gen 3. In December, DCS stated such a fact, accompanied by a leak by another tipster on X. With that, it seems likely that the chip could be for 2025's midrange devices instead of those of a higher tier. Those rumors also claimed the chip contained the model number SM8735 and would be purely "based on ARM" and not Qualcomm's newest Oryon cores.</p><p>Those old rumors also speculated on the chip's release, which could fall somewhere within Q1 2025 (no later than March). DCS' recent leak states the chip could appear on the upcoming iQOO and Redmi phones, which may line up with this assumed Q1 release.</p><p>The same Weibo tipster floated the theory that this upcoming flagship chip variant could push phones to pack ~7,000mAh batteries. Such devices are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/2025-might-bring-the-first-android-phone-with-an-8-000mah-battery">reportedly in the works</a> already, but that rumor involves Realme — at least, for now.</p>

<p>For a limited time, Best Buy (and some other retailers) are dropping $50 off the Meta Quest 3S 256GB, knocking the price of the midrange headset down to $349.99. </p>
<p>As a bonus, you'll still get to enjoy the other freebies that usually come with a Meta Quest purchase, such as three free months of a Meta Quest Plus subscription and a copy of Batman: Arkham Shadow. This deal won't last long, so I'd act fast if you're interested. </p>
<p><strong>Alternative deals: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DDJZW3C9">Amazon - $349.99</a> | <a href="https://www.meta.com/quest/quest-3s/">Meta - $349.99</a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/meta-quest-3s-256gb-get-batman-arkham-shadow-and-a-3-month-trial-of-meta-quest-included-all-in-one-headset-white/6596936.p" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="2a794030-a87a-4c98-85cc-62734954553b" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$399.99" data-dimension48="$399.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>Like I mentioned above, your purchase will come with three free months of Meta Quest Plus (usually $7.99 per month). This subscription service gives you instant access to a huge library of games and apps, plus you&apos;ll get a free title curated by Meta every month. </p><p>As described in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-review">our glowing 4.5/5-star review</a>, the Quest 3S is essentially Meta&apos;s attempt at bringing a high-quality VR experience into the mainstream. The headset boasts many of the same great features found in the regular Meta Quest 3 — such as identical Snapdragon processors, mixed reality specs, and 8GB of RAM — just in a more-affordable package. </p><p>You also get access to all of the same games, albeit at a slightly lower resolution. Comparing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-vs-quest-3">Quest 3S vs. the Quest 3</a>, you&apos;ll notice that the more-affordable headset doesn&apos;t come with a 3.5mm headphone jack and the field of view is a bit narrower, but are these small drawbacks enough to justify spending another $150 on a Meta Quest 3? The choice is yours, but if you&apos;re looking to try one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-vr-headsets">best VR headsets</a> at a reasonable price point, this deal is worth considering. </p>

<ul><li>Users on Reddit have started reporting that Google is pushing its dual SIM RCS support in Messages via a new stable version.</li><li>Threads state that the feature is appearing on several Pixel 9 and Samsung Galaxy devices in the U.S., Canada, and Germany.</li><li>Reports from last fall showed that Google was likely extending its testing of the feature as very few users spotted it in beta.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It looks like Google's next step in messaging for its U.S. users is seeing a proper rollout in January.</p><p>Highlighted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-messages-dual-sim-rcs-support-widespread-rollout/">Android Police</a>, users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages/comments/1i0nhgx/finally/?rdt=46566">on Reddit</a> have started a thread about the arrival of Dual SIM support for RCS texting in Google Messages. The O.P. (original poster) states they've received dual SIM over RCS support in Messages on their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-vs-pixel-9-pro">Pixel 9 Pro</a>. Another user chimed in, stating they've also received support for it, which involves using both SIMs "simultaneously."</p><p>That particular post added that their device <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages/comments/1i0nhgx/comment/m70jp07/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">is not enrolled in the beta</a> and has appeared in version messages.android_20241120_00_RC07 of the Messages app.</p><p>Several more posts say the dual SIM support has rolled onto the Pixel 9 Pro XL and the Galaxy Z Fold 6. Moreover, users have mentioned the feature delivering support for SIM cards belonging to Verizon, AT&T, and USMobile.</p><p>Elsewhere, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/13/google-messages-dual-sim-rcs/">9to5Google</a> post doubled down on user reports on Reddit regarding its stable app version release. The publication also highlighted other threads that claim the feature is even appearing for more users in the most recent Messages beta, v20250112_00_RC00. Additionally, users outside of the U.S. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages/comments/1i0poju/dualsim_now_active/">have reportedly noticed support</a> appearing on Android, which signals an even wider rollout than originally theorized.</p><p>A user with a Galaxy S23 FE in Canada posted a screenshot of the feature's arrival on their device, as well as another in Germany.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages/comments/1i0nhgx/finally">FINALLY!!</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages">r/GoogleMessages</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>Google has been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-dual-sim-rcs-support-us-rollout">slowly moving toward</a> its official push for dual SIM support for RCS texting since last fall. There was a more secluded beta earlier last year; however, some users started noticing it quite sparingly in November. The reports were sporadic as some saw it on stable while others only spotted it in its beta version.</p><p>Regardless, seeing as it's more apparent in January, users should notice the dual SIM feature in the RCS Chats page of the Messages app settings. There, beneath "turn on RCS," users will notice both SIM cards alongside two checkboxes. Users can decide which card to use at any given moment or have them both active at once.</p><p>It's worth mentioning that there are some routine verification steps the cards must go through in the app before everything's green.</p><p>Outside of RCS, Google recently detailed the addition of more AI software in Messages to help users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-now-has-smarter-detection-to-tackle-tricky-scam-messages">combat spam/tricky scam texts</a>. If the app detects a potential sign of spam, it will either automatically drop it in the appropriate folder or alert you about it for better judgment.</p>

<p>The flagship OnePlus 13 and the OnePlus 13R <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-and-13r-launch">debuted </a>last week globally. Both OnePlus phones have already started getting their first notable updates.</p><p>The OnePlus 13R, which launched with Android 15-based OxygenOS 15, has started receiving its first OxygenOS 15.0.0.403 update for the regions including India, Europe, and North America with corresponding build numbers <strong>CPH2691_15.0.0.403(EX01)</strong>, <strong>CPH2645_15.0.0.403(EX01)</strong>, and <strong>CPH2647_15.0.0.403(EX01)</strong>.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> at Android Central has also started getting the <strong>CPH2655_15.0.0.402(EX01)</strong> build number. Per the corresponding <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1770667430310313986">community post</a> regarding the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a>, it is an incremental rollout being rolled out in batches. If you are already on the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android handset</a>, expect it as soon as the rollout has just begun over the weekend.</p><p>The exclusive features included in the OnePlus 13 are new AI features to Google Messages, and according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MishaalRahman/status/1878870834254627193">Mishaal Rahman's findings</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-13-gemini-nano-3516037/">Android Authority</a>), evidently it is the inclusion of Gemini Nano. The firmware update for the handset in the U.S. brings a corresponding Android AICore app, which is required to download the AI model.</p>

<p>The Google Messages on the OnePlus 13 will now have the new Magic Compose button, which is an experimental feature that utilizes generative AI to provide suggested replies, per the conversation in the respective chat.</p><p>According to the full changelog posted by OnePlus, the latest firmware for the OnePlus 13R shares some common things with the OnePlus 13 firmware update. It includes a new feature for the photos, which introduces personalized watermarks.</p><p>Like Android's Quick Share, the OnePlus 13 and the 13R have a Touch to-share feature, which now supports iOS devices with the new update. Sharing files and photos to other devices could be a lot better after the update.</p>
<p>Both phone users will see several improvements when it comes to shots captured through Photo mode. The shots taken through both handsets' primary camera and telephoto lens should look better, as color enhancements are included in the update.</p><p>Additionally, for the OnePlus 13, the improvements can be seen in the clarity of 4K videos at 60fps. A fix is also included for photos getting too bright while captured in rear camera mode — on both the OnePlus 13 and 13R.</p>
<p>Other notable improvements include the stability of Wi-Fi connections and connections made through Bluetooth. For a better user experience, the company is also adding charging status to Live Alerts on both handsets. Both firmwares carry the December 2024 Android security patch, and the latest release offers improvements across system stability and performance.</p><p>Other nifty features on the OnePlus 13 include the ability to add a new Weather widget in 1 x 2 size to the home screen, and other enhancements can be seen across the step tracker and storage cleaner widgets. The flagship OnePlus 13 also improves audio quality.</p>

<p>We're just two weeks into 2025, and Motorola is dropping its first phones of the year. The Moto G Power 2025 and Moto G 2025 (which now omit the "5G" from their names) are the company's latest budget devices for anyone not looking to spend too much on a smartphone, and both come with colorful designs and large batteries.</p><p>Reading the duo is the Moto G Power 2025, which sports a 6.8-inch FHD+ LCD panel with a 120Hz refresh rate. Departing from last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-power-5g-2024-review">Moto G Power 5G 2024</a> a bit, the design more closely resembles the rest of Motorola's lineup with a seamless vegan leather back that covers the 50MP triple camera array.</p><p>The phone is powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 6300, which is a slight downgrade from last year's chip. Still, performance should prove adequate, and the difference will likely be negligible, especially with the 8GB of RAM on board. The phone also runs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> out of the box with features like audio sharing, enhanced accessibility, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-motorola-smart-connect">Smart Connect</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="yvxjNxKG5rhHhBZiHe7PST" name="Moto-G-Power-2025-official-render-leaf-green" alt="Official render of the Moto G Power 2025 in Leaf Green" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yvxjNxKG5rhHhBZiHe7PST.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="4000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Underneath it all is a 5,000mAh battery, which Motorola says should enable all-day battery life. There's also 30W wired charging and 15W wireless charging.</p><p>Motorola is also stepping up its protection for the Moto G Power 2025, with Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protecting the display. The phone also sports MIL-STD-810H certification and IP68/IP69 water and dust resistance, similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> — the first we've seen on a Motorola phone at this price point. This means the phone can withstand being submerged and should be able to hold out when facing high-pressure water jets.</p><p>The Moto G Power 2025 comes in Slate Gray and a rather striking Leaf Green and will be available starting February 6 for $299 unlocked.</p>

<p>The Moto G 2025 is a step down from the Power. It features a slightly smaller 6.7-inch display and the same Dimensity 6300 chipset, which seems pretty comparable to the Snapdragon chip powering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-5g-2024-review">last year's model</a>. The difference between this and the Power 2025 is the lower 4 or 6GB of RAM and 64 or 128GB of expandable storage (compared to 256GB).</p><p>The Power 2025 comes with an 8MP ultrawide camera, while the Moto G 2025 sports a 2MP macro sensor. Both have ambient light sensors.</p><p>The Moto G 2025 gets a 5,000mAh battery and upgraded charging speeds up to 30W when compared to its predecessor, although it misses out on wireless charging. Protection also isn't as robust with Gorilla Glass 3 over the display and IP52 water and dust resistance.</p><p>However, just like the Power 2025, the Moto G 2025 sports a vegan leather finish on the back and comes in Forest Gray and Sapphire Blue. It will be available starting January 30 for $199.</p>

<hr>
<p>Xiaomi has a new Android tablet, the Xiaomi Pad 7, which has entered the Indian market. It is the successor to the Xiaomi Pad 6, launched in 2023 in Indian and global markets.</p><p>The latest Pad 7 looks very familiar in design compared to its predecessor, even in colorways; a new Green color is added, while the previous Gray and Purple remain intact. The Pad 7 is slightly thinner than the previous iteration, measuring 6.18mm, while the display measures 11.2 inches, almost similar to the Pad 6.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="cdnmhyhgpqoQuLrRcz2mzR" name="Xiaomi-Pad-7-01" alt="Xiaomi Pad 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cdnmhyhgpqoQuLrRcz2mzR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Xiaomi)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It incorporates an LCD panel with a 3:2 aspect ratio (3200 x 2136 resolution) and a 144Hz refresh rate. It further features Full DC Dimming and is TÜV Rheinland Flicker Free Certified. Xiaomi notes that it is a nano texture display that makes it glare-free and reduces screen reflectivity. For protection, the display also includes Gorilla Glass 3 on top.</p><p>Underneath, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablet</a> has a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-7-plus-gen-3-launch">Snapdragon 7 Plus Gen 3</a> SoC with clock speeds of up to 2.8GHz. Storage options include up to 12GB of RAM and 256GB of onboard storage. The tablet also incorporates a four-speaker setup with support for Dolby Atmos and Hi-Res & Hi-Res Wireless Audio.</p>
<p>The camera setup is essentially the same, with a 13MP primary camera and an 8MP selfie shooter. The device has a large 8850mAh battery capacity, and this time, Xiaomi has bumped up the charging speeds to 45W fast charging. Other highlights of the Pad 7 tablet include support for Wi-Fi 6e, Bluetooth 5.4, and the Android 15-based Xiaomi Hyper OS 2 operating system.</p><p>In terms of AI, the Xiaomi Pad 7 supports AI Writing, AI Live Subtitles, and Xiaomi Creation. The company notes that these features need a subsequent OTA upgrade, which is expected to arrive next month.</p>
<p>The company also provides notable accessories for the Xiaomi Pad 7, including a protective cover, the Xiaomi Pad 7 Focus Pen, and the Focus Keyboard. While the Pad 6 was offered in both LTE and Wi-Fi models, the Pad 7 is currently available for sale in a standard version in the Indian market. It starts at Rs 27,999 (~$324) for the 8GB+128GB storage and retails at Rs 30,999 (~$358) for the 12GB RAM and 256GB storage variant.</p>

<p>Does Anker ever miss? Apparently it doesn't, because the charging accessories brand has been killing it lately. The brand always has something cool up its sleeves. This time, it's the excellent Anker Nano 75W Car Charger.</p><p>Anker has found a neat way to improve the humble car charger. Most car chargers that plug into the auxiliary power outlet are cheap and compact. They usually come with either USB-C or USB-A ports, or sometimes a mix of both. The Nano 75W Car Charger has two Type-C ports, but what's fascinating is that one of the ports has a built-in retractable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-cables-adapters">USB-C cable</a>.</p><p>Anker is calling this non-removable cable the InstaCord. It's a standard USB Type-C cable with a flat fettuccine-like shape. The cable pulls out and measures 29.5 inches in length. Once it's out, a second tug makes it roll back into the charger automatically.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2762px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="TwqtcjS6wtZABmYLAFSt8G" name="Anker Nano 75W Car Charger" alt="Anker Nano 75W Car Charger inside a car" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TwqtcjS6wtZABmYLAFSt8G.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2762" height="1554" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The retractable cable leaves only one other port free, but I think that's just fine. This is such a smart way to reduce the clutter of cables in your vehicle. I hate having wires lying around and getting trampled on in the car. Unplugging and replugging them constantly is another hassle. So, having a cable that takes no space whatsoever is an ingenious solution!</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3475px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="XFqzKfDXv4npf5mJMJ3Z8G" name="Anker Nano 75W Car Charger" alt="Anker Nano 75W Car Charger inside a car" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XFqzKfDXv4npf5mJMJ3Z8G.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3475" height="1955" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Of all the weird and wonderful cables I've tested, this retractable charging cable is one of the best ones. You might think the non-removable factor would be an issue, but I had zero issues with this while testing the Nano 75W Car Charger.</p><p>A car or vehicle doesn't require you to unplug and reuse your cable anywhere else anyway, unlike at home or at your workplace, where you might need your cable to be removable so you can use it elsewhere.</p><p>Anker promises at least 10,000 safe retractions with the Type-C InstaCord and over 12,000 swings, so it should last a while. I've used it for about two weeks, and the cable still looks and feels as good as new.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5qbeSVBW69RFrnFrDVfUcG" name="Anker Nano 75W Car Charger" alt="Anker Nano 75W Car Charger inside a car" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5qbeSVBW69RFrnFrDVfUcG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Generally, standard car chargers are rated around 40W to 50W. The Anker Nano 75W Car Charger packs a mightier punch at 75W, so you can fast charge not just <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">phones</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">tablets</a>, and accessories but also larger mobile devices like laptops and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebooks</a> at max speeds on the go.</p><p>When both ports are in use at the same time, you get 45W from the retractable InstaCord and 30W from the other USB-C port.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HSKdubz9rBnLjXBF6ySKbG" name="Anker Nano 75W Car Charger" alt="Anker Nano 75W Car Charger inside a car" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HSKdubz9rBnLjXBF6ySKbG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I do wish the InstaCord was a bit longer than 29.5 inches, though, because depending on the size of your car, the passengers in the backseats may not find it long enough to use comfortably.</p><p>Apart from that, the design is impeccable. Who needs more than two ports in a moving vehicle? On top of that, 75W is a lot of power, even when split between two ports.</p><p>Everything wraps up nicely once you look at the retail price of the Anker Nano 75W Car Charger. This thing costs only $29.99, which is fabulous considering you basically get a two-for-one deal with this product. Sure, there are cheaper car chargers at Amazon or Walmart, but they don't come with a cable built-in, and neither do they have 75W of power output.</p><p>So, if you need a car charger that fits into the auxiliary power outlet of your automobile, stop looking and buy the Anker Nano 75W Car Charger. It's the best car charger available right now.</p>

Samsung launched the phone with a newly minted flat display, a unique anti-glare layer on the screen, a stronger titanium frame, and a stronger software update guarantee than ever.</p><p>At launch, it was clear what Samsung would need to do to make the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> a better phone. But while 2024's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best premium phone</a> launched strong, nagging issues crept up throughout the year.</p><p>The fancy new display was found to suffer from some strange quality and configuration issues, and some build quality issues with the glass have crept up after a few months of use. Samsung's Android 15 update was delayed several times, and while we're already on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-s24-series-one-ui-7-beta-3-roll-out">One UI 7 beta 3</a>, the final version isn't expected until at least sometime in late January at the earliest.</p><p>One UI 7 has also been the source of much criticism and, funny enough, praise due to some major UI design changes. But while One UI 7's new design doesn't seem to be everyone's cup of tea, Samsung is delivering some major improvements for the S24 Ultra that will ultimately please fans in the end, especially as the newer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy S25</a> series approaches.</p>

<p>Ever since the Galaxy S24 Ultra's launch, users have been complaining about the display. Whether it was the graininess of the pixels or the permanent smudges that have started appearing on some people's phone displays, the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra's display has been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-galaxy-s25-ultra-needs-to-fix-four-major-s24-ultra-display-problems">a bit of a disappointment</a>.</p><p>Complaints have revolved around a few problems, some of which can be considered major given the high price of the Galaxy S24 Ultra. All Galaxy S24 Ultra units <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-grainy-mura-problem-reported">are affected by mura</a>, which means that each pixel isn't reaching the same brightness level as adjacent pixels. This doesn't just happen at high brightness, and it exposes a quality downgrade we didn't expect to see in a Samsung flagship.</p><p>We've also seen several instances of people getting permanent "smudges" on their screens. Based on several examples, it seems like it's the result of the oleophobic layer rubbing off prematurely. There's no way to fix this if it happens outside of replacing the outer glass entirely, so it's best to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-galaxy-s24-ultra-screen-protectors">put a screen protector on it</a> as soon as you unbox it to prevent this issue.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="WYyF49Mn6WpPDz9jXKmFEG" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-smudgy-screen" alt="Smudges on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra's screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WYyF49Mn6WpPDz9jXKmFEG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung might have fixed the dull screen issue about a month after launch but the company is still seeing complaints of reduced display brightness and color banding across social media. Some of the brightness issues have to do with thermal management, as the phone tones down the brightness after a few minutes to keep it from getting hot.</p><p>However, the biggest issue is that Samsung artificially reduces the maximum brightness by using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a>. This dimming method helps increase color accuracy on OLEDs at low brightness but Samsung is using it at all brightness levels for an unknown reason. Using PWM dimming at high brightness reduces the perceived brightness level of the display, something Samsung could fix it it offered a proper PWM-free dimming mode as rivals like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> do.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The Galaxy S24 Ultra's display has been the center of user complaints about the phone, ranging from display quality to early wear and tear on the glass.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>We've also seen several reports of users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/1aglx09/s24_ultra_scratch_resistance_is_awful/">on Reddit</a> getting micro scratches on their displays despite claiming to be careful with their phones. Smartphone glass has evolved a lot over the years, but there seems to be something different about the glass used on the S24 Ultra. My unit also has a few micro scratches despite it not being my main phone throughout the year.</p><p>Every time I've used the Galaxy S24 Ultra over the past year, I've had issues using the ultrasonic fingerprint sensor. While some folks prefer ultrasonic sensors, people like myself find them to be less reliable than optical sensors, especially when a screen protector is applied. Thankfully, the upcoming One UI 7 update <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-galaxy-s24-might-have-faster-fingerprint-unlocks-with-one-ui-7-beta">addresses concerns</a> of fingerprint sensor speed and accuracy and, so far in my testing, has made it substantially more reliable.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="bbBhSiwX97RD7qzGHxbzGm" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-with-oneplus-12-and-google-pixel-9" alt="Customizing the lockscreen on a Galaxy S24 Ultra with a green AI-generated wallpaper" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bbBhSiwX97RD7qzGHxbzGm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>If you love the square corners of the Galaxy S24 Ultra, you might want to hold on to the phone for as long as possible as Samsung is said to be rounding them off with future phones.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>But while the display might not be the best thing in the world, Samsung's design and build quality of the S24 Ultra's remaining hardware has shone through. The titanium frame has received plenty of praise and holds up well with use, although <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://r2.community.samsung.com/t5/Galaxy-S/Minor-Scratches-on-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-Titanium-Frame-Titanium/td-p/16200852">a few users</a> have found that certain cases can scratch the frame. It's strange, for sure, but something to look out for if you're still rocking a pristine Galaxy S24 Ultra.</p><p>While Samsung has been using <em>very square</em> corners on the Galaxy S Ultra line since the Galaxy S22, rumor has it that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> will do away with these for more rounded corners. Despite rounding out the corners, Samsung is reportedly making the sides of the phone completely flat all around.</p><p>This design would match that of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review">Galaxy S24</a> which received the flat treatment last year. Personally, I hate the flat side rail design and would rather see Samsung keep the curved sides from the Galaxy S24 Ultra, which are much nicer to hold and make it easier to pick the phone up from a table or other flat surface.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZpGswcHfE36tUgcaFkrEF6" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-One-UI-7-Beta-2-split-notification-shade" alt="The new split notification pane on One UI 7 beta 2 on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZpGswcHfE36tUgcaFkrEF6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra arrived with the first seven-year update promise Samsung has ever made for its phones. While that sounds nice on paper, Samsung will be roughly four months late in delivering its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> update by the time One UI 7 finally makes its public debut.</p><p>Android 15 certainly isn't the biggest update in the world but One UI 7 looks to be worth the wait. I tried out the second One UI 7 beta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">back in December</a> and was generally impressed with what I saw. Samsung <em>finally</em> ditched the age-old paginated app drawer for a vertical app drawer by default, although you can switch back to the old style if you prefer that.</p><p>The company is also using a new design for its multitasking interface that looks almost identical to an iPhone. Some people might not be happy with the change for this reason, but it's far more practical than the awful old side-by-side design. This design makes it easier to quickly multitask as you can "peak" at the next few apps while scrolling through the tiles while the previous design only showed one app's tile at a time.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="7GZMDwezjKoxMi77GUAjBU" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-one-ui-7-multitasking-02" alt="The new multitasking UI in One UI 7 on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7GZMDwezjKoxMi77GUAjBU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung is also borrowing Apple's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsungs-one-ui-7-might-take-a-big-page-out-of-apples-ios-playbook">split notification pane design</a>, making it so that the phone's notification pane only appears when swiping down on the left side of the status bar, while swiping down on the right side brings up a full-screen quick toggles pane. This design is polarizing as it's contrary to standard Android design, but some folks prefer the larger quick toggles pane to be the default.</p><p>Regardless of your preference, nearly everything can be customized out of the box to suit your preferences. The only exception, for now, is the multitasking interface, which usually requires <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-good-lock">Samsung Good Lock</a> to change. Thankfully, Samsung is said to be giving <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsungs-good-lock-is-going-global-with-a-fresh-redesign-in-one-ui-7">Good Lock a total overhaul</a> when One UI 7 officially launches later this month, so you should be able to change it if you're not a fan of the new design (or like one of the many alternatives Samsung has always offered).</p><p>Samsung's real strength has long been offering something for everyone, and the Galaxy S24 Ultra's software experience perfectly embodies that mantra.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-performance-and-battery-life-2">Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra: Performance and battery life</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="cUHxa7bj5cGp8nq2nL6pNg" name="Samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-performance-benchmark" alt="Running a performance benchmark on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cUHxa7bj5cGp8nq2nL6pNg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As we expected <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-galaxy-s24-support-ray-tracing">when Samsung announced it</a> last year, ray-tracing on phones hasn't caught on yet. Diablo Immortal launched its big ray-tracing update, but we haven't seen a huge push for using this technology on phones, presumably due to battery life and performance constraints that phones uniquely face when compared to consoles or PCs that push the same tech.</p><p>Overall, though, the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra still delivers stellar real-world performance. Newer phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> significantly outpace it in terms of performance and thermal limits, but that's fully expected from a new generation. For its part, the Galaxy S24 Ultra never feels sluggish, but Samsung tends to throttle brightness quite a bit when the phone starts to get warm.</p><p>This keeps performance high and prevents the phone from overheating, but it's annoying to have to deal with low brightness at the worst time: in the bright sun. Outside of this situation, however, the S24 Ultra performs admirably and should please even the pickiest of users, even a year later.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Overall performance is still fantastic even a year later, but the phone's display dims too quickly when the phone gets hot.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>One problem that only feels worse with time, however, is the dreadfully slow charging speed. Samsung, Google, and Apple's phones all still charge incredibly slowly, even with a "fast" 45W charger. Phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> can fully charge in about 30 minutes with the charger included in the box, but Samsung phones still take well over an hour.</p><p>Some people have gotten through this by having a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-charging-pads">great wireless charger</a> on their desk or in their car, but it doesn't replace the proper fast charging that most Android brands offer. At the least, battery life is still great a year later and more software-side tweaks in One UI 7 should further help keep battery life great over the seven-year lifespan of the phone.</p>

<p>When I published the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-camera-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra camera review</a> last year, I marveled at the improvements Samsung had made. The company had gone from mediocre to the best in most situations, barring just one big area: motion capture.</p><p>While the Galaxy S24 Ultra offered up some options to help reduce blurry moving subjects — usually kids or pets that won't hold still — its performance was still worse than the competition. As of a year later, this hasn't changed a bit. If anything, Samsung looks worse than ever because <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-camera-review">even OnePlus has fixed the same problem</a> that plagued its phones for a long time.</p>

<p>Outside of blurry moving subjects, the Galaxy S24 Ultra still suffers from an incredibly irritating slow shutter speed problem. When you press the shutter button to take a picture on a Galaxy S24 Ultra, there's a truly annoying lag that takes place in the camera viewfinder. I don't see this on <em>any</em> other phone on the market and it's something Samsung needs to address on the S25 Ultra.</p><p>Samsung still does an excellent job of portrait photos, but I've been less impressed with the phone's camera this year than I was last year. Low-light shots aren't as good as the Pixel 9 Pro or OnePlus 13, and even daytime portrait shots aren't as vibrant or beautiful as I expect. While photos from some newer Android phones might be better, the Galaxy S24 Ultra's video recording quality is still top-notch among Android phones.</p>

<p>With the Galaxy S25 Ultra on the cusp of being officially announced, you're probably wondering if it's still worth buying the Galaxy S24 Ultra. While I can't fully answer that question until the Galaxy S25 Ultra is actually announced, we know for sure that you can get a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/why-wait-for-the-s25-when-you-can-score-up-to-usd950-off-the-galaxy-s24-ultra-right-now">Galaxy S24 Ultra deal</a> that will save you hundreds versus waiting a week or so to preorder a Galaxy S25 Ultra.</p><p>The first question is how picky you'll be about any potential display issues you're bound to run into with the S24 Ultra. The display has garnered the largest number of complaints I've seen about the phone over the last year, and while some of them are from power users who nitpick the smallest details, plenty of problems have been noticed by folks who aren't tech-savvy, too. There's no guarantee that Samsung will fix any of these with the S25 Ultra, but it'll likely address at least a few.</p><p>You'll also need to consider the camera, which may be <strong>the </strong>biggest reason to choose something else. If you primarily take pictures of your kids or pets, you should consider a OnePlus 13 or a Pixel 9 Pro. Both take far better pictures of moving subjects, with the Pixel taking a slight edge in this category. If this particular photography category isn't big on your list, the S24 Ultra could be a great pick.</p><p>Lastly, you may want to consider grabbing a OnePlus 13 over either a Galaxy S24 Ultra or a potential Galaxy S25 Ultra for battery life and charging speed. Samsung phones, along with iPhones and Pixels, have long been among the slowest-charging smartphones on the market. That's never been truer in 2025 when phones like the OnePlus 13 take 20 minutes to top-up the battery while an S24 Ultra might take an hour and a half.</p>

<hr>
<p>WhatsApp is reportedly working on a fresh widget that brings Meta AI right to your home screen and snaps photos for instant AI analysis, all in one spot.</p><p>The new widget, spotted in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whatsapp">WhatsApp</a> beta 2.25.1.27 by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-for-android-2-25-1-27-whats-new/" target="_blank">WABetaInfo</a>, offers two handy features. You can tap the text field to chat directly with Meta AI or use the camera icon to snap a photo and send it for instant AI analysis or other tasks.</p><p>The widget, shown in a 4x1 grid layout, joins WhatsApp’s current 3x2 and 1x1 widgets.</p><p>The new Meta AI widget will be completely optional and will sit alongside WhatsApp’s existing widgets. Designed for convenience, it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-starts-testing-meta-ai-on-whatsapp">lets users chat with Meta AI</a> straight from their home screen, skipping the need to open the app.</p><p>Another standout feature of the new widget is its ability to combine quick photo capture with direct Meta AI access. You'll presumably be able to edit images, analyze content, or even ask questions about a photo and get smart, context-aware answers.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:211.13%;"><img id="hHKBMYjaxnd3RTeERgEure" name="Meta-AI-widget" alt="Meta AI widget on the home screen showing access to Meta AI and a camera button" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hHKBMYjaxnd3RTeERgEure.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="1689" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WABetaInfo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Just a heads-up, you’ll need access to WhatsApp’s AI chat features to use this widget. Since Meta AI is still being rolled out in stages and only available in certain territories, it won’t be available to everyone right away.</p><p>Right now, you can access a basic version of Meta AI through WhatsApp’s existing widgets, as noted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/whatsapp-new-meta-ai-widget-beta/" target="_blank">Android Police</a>. However, these don’t offer the full features or smooth functionality expected from the new Meta AI widget in the works.</p><p>A big difference is that the current widgets don’t have a camera shortcut for quick image capture and sharing for AI analysis, something the new widget will include. This shows just how much more seamless the upcoming widget is going to be.</p><p>Meta AI in WhatsApp brings a bunch of tools, all <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-ai-apps-llama-3-launch">powered by Llama 3.1</a>. It goes beyond basic chatbot features, offering a mode akin to Gemini Live meant for more lively and interactive chats. Plus, you can translate languages, summarize info, and even create images right within WhatsApp.</p>

Seeing as OnePlus and OPPO decided against releasing a new foldable phone in 2024, I've been wondering what a potential OnePlus Open successor would bring, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-2-might-outdo-the-honor-magic-v3-as-the-worlds-slimmest-foldable">now we might have an idea</a>.</p><p>Until the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> arrived, the Open was my daily driver, and I still find myself wanting to go back to it. However, after seeing the latest teaser from a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/1110411735/P9lMhlTL0">post on Weibo</a>, I'm really hoping that OPPO didn't "lose the plot."</p>

<p>What I mean is that there seems to be quite a bit of focus on how thin a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a> can get. It remains one of the main selling points of the 9 Pro Fold but is something that I don't even care about.</p><p>There were a few things that made the Open great, and the design was definitely one of them. But it's not the main reason why I fell in love with it, and I'm worried that we're in store for some unnecessary sacrifices just for the sake of being thinner than a #2 pencil.</p>

There were minimal performance gains with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, and outside of some foldable phones outside of the U.S., the Open offered the best cameras in this form factor.</p><p>I've even been impressed with OxygenOS despite it not being as feature-rich as what you'll find on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>. Then again, I don't think <em>any</em> foldable phone matches up with what Samsung phones can do, at least for now. But the Open gets pretty darn close, and I hope that even more functionality comes with the next major release.</p><p>What I don't want is for OPPO and OnePlus to fall into the trap of picking a primary selling point only to make sacrifices elsewhere, particularly where the camera is concerned.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="TyHPSrVEVebvBV8YXUTdwC" name="oneplus-open-7.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TyHPSrVEVebvBV8YXUTdwC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Open sports a massive module right smack dab in the middle of the back. Sure, this helps the Open <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-compared-the-z-fold-6-and-oneplus-open-camera-against-mother-nature-the-results-were-unexpected">stand out</a> from the crowd, but it actually houses a performant trio of sensors, headlined by the 48MP "Pixel Stacked" main camera. This is paired with a 64MP telephoto lens, with 3x optical zoom and 6x "in-sensor" zoom. Then, there's a 48MP ultra-wide lens that also doubles as your macro camera in a pinch and does a pretty good job.</p><p>All of that sounds pretty great, and the Open's camera system still holds up today. Google is partly to blame, as we don't have the same camera system as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">9 Pro XL</a> in the 9 Pro Fold because it likely would've made for a thicker phone. To me, it's a dumb reason, but maybe that's why I'm here writing about phones and not making those kinds of "upper-level" decisions.</p>

<p>What I'm trying to say is that I hope that the OnePlus Open 2 is even better than its predecessor in every way possible. If the phone is announced and the camera is the same (or a downgrade), I'm going to be extremely disappointed.</p><p>I've been wanting flagship cameras in foldable phones for years, but the only way that's been possible is to import something from abroad. The Open 2 has the unique opportunity to put both Google and Samsung to shame, and I just hope that it can hit the nail on the head.</p>

And thanks to Google&apos;s seven-year software promise, 2023&apos;s Pixel 8 Pro will continue to receive OS/security updates for years to come.</p><p>But what about the Google Pixel 9 series?

The newer Pro has more RAM and a slightly better Tensor chipset, but it&apos;s unlikely you&apos;ll notice much of a difference with regular, day-to-day tasks. If you&apos;re an Android enthusiast with some extra cash lying around, by all means go with the newer phone. But if you simply want a great phone that won&apos;t break the bank, the Pixel 8 Pro remains a masterpiece for the masses. </p>

<p>Monday morning brought in some exciting news from Nothing. A leaked email, allegedly from CEO Carl Pei and shared on X (formerly Twitter)<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-will-prioritize-ai-over-phone-3-but-is-that-the-right-call" target="_blank"> by @evleaks, </a>suggested that the company will be joining the big leagues, aka the ring of flagship phones, in 2025 with its Nothing Phone 3.</p><p>Like most flagship phones in the market, the upcoming Nothing phone is set to offer “breakthrough innovations in user interface” and will feature AI.</p><p>In June 2024<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-will-prioritize-ai-over-phone-3-but-is-that-the-right-call" target="_blank">, Carl Pei took to Twitter to announce</a> that the Phone 3 will be pushed to 2025 as the company prioritizes improving its AI systems. This is exactly what the recent memo stated as well, Pei added that Nothing will further strengthen its products by focusing on "expanding its camera hardware and software development teams by 50%."</p>

<p>The email stated that “a landmark smartphone launch” is set in Q1. While it's unclear if this is referring to the Nothing Phone 3, we anticipate that Nothing is waiting to reveal a new phone at MWC (Mobile World Congress) 2025 in Barcelona, Spain, as it did with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Phone 2a</a> last year.</p><p>Recently, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3-database-listing-chip-details-leak">Nothing smartphone was spotted in a Geekbench database, </a>with model number "A059." The listing states that this device in development could debut with 8GB of RAM and Android 15. It also adds that the phone will debut with a 6.5-inch OLED display and Qualcomm's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ai-is-coming-to-more-budget-phones-thanks-to-qualcomms-new-snapdragon-7s-gen-3">Snapdragon 7s Gen 3</a> SoC, making it unclear if this is, in fact, the Nothing Phone 3.</p><p>Another speculation is that the Nothing has three phones in active development but does not go into detail as to what those devices might be. It is rumored that the Nothing Phone 3 might debut with other sidekicks along with it, an elite Nothing Phone 3 Pro/Plus and the budget Phone 3a (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/nothing-is-ready-to-join-the-big-league-with-first-flagship-phone/" target="_blank">Android Police</a>).</p><p>As for how much the phone could cost, rumors state that the Phone 3 could be around the $600 mark. Talking more about the AI system, Pei stated that the company is "aiming at redefining the user experience with personal computing systems- creating technology that knows you, makes your life easier, and is present where you are."</p>

<ul><li>Samsung is reportedly packing a new 12nm process version of its LPDDR5X RAM, courtesy of Micron, into the Galaxy S25 series.</li><li>A Korean report claims this swap in process is due to the OEM running into "heat generation" issues with the 13nm process.</li><li>The Galaxy S25 Ultra is also rumored to feature upward of 16GB of RAM, which will be highest it has ever seen if the leaks prove true.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A new rumor about the Galaxy S25 suggests Samsung could give it an upgrade that keeps it nice and chill.</p><p>A recent report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.etnews.com/20250110000227">EtNews</a> (Korean) claims Samsung will place its newly developed RAM technology into the Galaxy S25 series (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2025/01/galaxy-s25-samsung-improved-lpddr5x-ram-chips.html">Android Headlines</a>). According to the publication, the new tech was developed using a new 12nm process instead of the 13nm process that the Galaxy S24 series rocks.</p><p>With this supposed change, there's one major reported difference: stored heat. The publication's "industry sources" suggest that this new LPDDR5X RAM in the Galaxy S25 will assist with heat generation.</p><p>So, it seems likely that this new form of RAM will generate less heat during continuous/rigorous tasks, thus facilitating an even cooler Galaxy S25 flagship series.</p><p>The change to 12nm was reportedly due to a "heat generation issue" when using the 13nm process. This reason has forced Samsung to swap its RAM chip manufacturer from its in-house kitchen to Micron. Those at Android Headlines add that these slightly upgraded RAM chips may be a little more efficient than what the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">Galaxy S24 series</a> was given.</p>

<p>Past RAM rumors suggest the Galaxy S25 Ultra <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-galaxy-s25-ultra-could-bump-up-ram-in-its-higher-end-models">could see a bump</a> in its higher-end models. The upcoming could see more RAM than previous generations as speculation claims its 256BGB variant could grab 12GB of RAM. What's more, the device's alleged 1TB variant could see roughly 16GB of RAM.</p><p>That rumor also tossed Samsung's Galaxy AI into the equation, stating the increase in RAM could be to better handle its on-device work. Perhaps, with what we're seeing about a new 12nm RAM process for the series, both could help as the Galaxy S25 will likely have a lot going on internally and software-wise.</p><p>Multiple ongoing tasks will surely create an increase in heat, but taking a small step — such as with its RAM — could aid it in the long run.</p><p>What caught everyone's eye last week was a huge Galaxy S25 series <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-specs-leak">specifications leak</a>. That seemingly revealed the full breakdown of the devices ahead of Samsung's confirmed release. The Galaxy S25 Ultra is rumored to see a 6.9-inch display with a 120Hz refresh rate and a 5,000mAh battery with 45W charging.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 has been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">confirmed</a> for a January 22 release, but don't forget about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">your official guide</a> to everything about the flagship trio leading up to launch.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung posted a short teaser video today (Jan 13), which seemingly alludes to a huge update for its AI, Bixby.</li><li>In the clip, the person involved is giving Bixby a list of tasks to complete, which include an online search and saving that information.</li><li>Samsung's executive vice president, Won-joon Choi, stated the company plans to bolster Bixby due to the rise in gen AI and LLMs.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung is ramping up the hype surrounding its next Unpacked event as a new teaser drops and teases is AI assistant.</p><p>The Korean OEM posted a short, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/AoX8nleSb64">17-second video teaser</a> on YouTube today (Jan 13) about a "True AI companion" (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-shows-off-bixby-upgrades-galaxy-s25-teaser-video/">SamMobile</a>). It seems that Samsung is preparing to upgrade Bixby with a better understanding/comprehension of long, complex commands for (likely) a range of topics.</p><p>In the video, the woman is talking to Bixby on her Galaxy device, which is only highlighted by a rising whimsical wave of blue energy.</p><p>Their command involves telling Bixby to search for an outdoor-seating Italian restaurant that is also "pet-friendly." Additionally, she asks the AI assistant to send it to another person — Luca — and to also "put it in my calendar."</p><p>While Samsung Galaxy users have the company's Galaxy AI to help with tasks, it's not <em>really </em>a "companion." So, as the publication also notes, this feels more like a nod at what's coming next for Bixby. What's more, the post speculates that Samsung may improve the AI helper with better NLP (natural language processing), which could explain the demonstration of this long command with various tasks woven throughout.</p><p>One thing to note is that Samsung has clearly stated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-teases-generative-ai-plans-bixby">it has no plans of giving up on Bixby</a>, per the executive vice president of Samsung’s mobile business, Won-joon Choi. Last spring, Won-joon Choi stated that the company needs to "redefine the role of Bixby" as generative AI and LLMs (large language models) continue to rise.</p><p>More importantly, Won-joon Choi teased that the work Samsung was doing with Bixby would facilitate more "natural conversations." The company's latest teaser seemingly does this. The company's executive vice president also stated that Bixby is a "key voice assistant" across its gadgets and gizmos.</p><p>Before that, Samsung did upgrade Bixby with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai-bixby-integration-announced">hands-free update</a> that brought Galaxy AI to the assistant. Utilizing the company's software, Bixby was able to leverage Live Translate, spelling corrections, webpage summaries, and more all by a user's voice command. This initially arrived for the Galaxy S24 before hitting a few past-gen phones.</p><p>There was also an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-major-gen-ai-bixby-rework-arrives">overhaul for Bixby</a> that arrived for an overseas market launch of a Galaxy foldable.</p><p>However, with what we've seen teased today, it's clear that there's more in store for Samsung's Bixby <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">on the Galaxy S25</a>. The flagship trio will launch on January 22. It's not far away and we'll finally be able to see if these new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-potential-bixby-relaunch">Bixby upgrades are worth it or not</a>.</p>

<ul><li>Google is reportedly working on a new button in Circle to Search to help users on Android become better gamers.</li><li>The button, currently titled "Get Game Help," will reportedly take a screenshot of your game and run it through the engine.</li><li>Google recently introduced barcode/QR code scanning in Circle to Search alongside help for complex math problems.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is seemingly working on taking its device-wide search software to the next level for Android gamers.</p><p>In an APK teardown, the folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/circle-to-search-get-game-help-apk-teardown-3515789/">Android Authority</a> state that Google is potentially developing a new help function for games. The publication reportedly spotted a new suggested option called "Get Game Help." What was discovered was pretty bare bones — though, the actual rollout may not expand much beyond it taking a snapshot of your screen before running a proper search.</p><p>With notable X tipster AssembleDebug assisting, the demo provided showed that Circle to Search will take a snapshot of your screen.</p><p>After placing it in the search field, it will supposedly "add some search text" on its own. This "text" looks to be the following statement: "Get help with this game." Curiously, Circle to Search doesn't specify (in its written query) what game the snapshot concerns.</p><p>From the quick test, Google Search can recognize the game in question; however, the results are extremely broad and don't necessarily <em>help</em>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:271px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:221.40%;"><img id="QUWwgxa2kdjgNUYu3r3oNP" name="google-circle-to-search-game-help-button" alt="Circle to Search may soon help users on Android become better gamers with online assistance." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QUWwgxa2kdjgNUYu3r3oNP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="271" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's no telling when this feature will arrive for Android users. The post states it was discovered in version 16.0.7 of the Google app.</p><p>Early on, one thing to note is how general Search's results are for this "get help with this game query." Once it arrives, it might be beneficial for users to re-write the AI's query to something more specific, which was also noted by the publication. Moreover, this feature could be of better to other games like Honkai: Star Rail or Zenless Zone Zero where the content is a little more defined — and the communities (think Reddit and X) for help.</p><p>The demo used Subway Surfer as an example and most of the results provided were basic as they covered Play Store results and TikTok videos.</p><p>Development is likely still progressing, so we'll have to keep our eyes peeled for an official launch later on.</p><p>Last summer, Google expanded its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/galaxy-z-fold-6-and-z-flip-6-get-new-circle-to-search-features">Circle to Search capabilities</a> by providing barcode scanning and help for math homework. When questioned, the company stated students could leverage Circle to Search for "symbolic math" equations and receive "step-by-step" help for how to solve them. Following its initial debut on Samsung's Galaxy foldables, Google dropped it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-circle-to-search-is-now-your-barcode-and-qr-code-scanner">on its Pixels</a> a couple of months later.</p><p>Circle to Search <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-circle-to-search-ai-powered-multisearch-rollout">also piggybacks off</a> Google's AI Overviews for users attaching a screenshot and a quick query.</p>

<ul><li>The Samsung Galaxy Ring now comes in sizes 14 and 15 and is available in 53 markets, including 16 new countries.</li><li>Two new sleep tracking features are available including sleep time guidance and a new sleep environment report that syncs with SmartThings.</li><li>The new mindfulness tracker feature lets users track moods, breathing, and stress.</li></ul>
<p>Samsung is working on making the Galaxy Ring more attractive than ever by expanding its health tracking features and ensuring that it fits more customers than ever before.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Samsung Galaxy Ring</a> now comes in sizes 5-15, two sizes larger than when I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">reviewed the Ring</a> last year. Those new sizes 14 and 15 come in all three colorways, including silver, gold, and black, and will debut on January 22, 2025, alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-unpacked-january-2025">upcoming Galaxy S25 series</a>.</p><p>Samsung also says it's available in 16 new countries including Cyprus, Czech, Greece, Hungary, Israel, Japan, Malaysia, Mauritius, New Zealand, Singapore, Slovakia, South Africa, Taiwan, Vietnam, and Zambia.</p>

<p>The first new Galaxy Ring software feature is the mindfulness tracker, which will be available in the Samsung Health app soon. The new mindfulness section of the app shows a calendar complete with easy-to-understand, color-coded faces that summarize each day's mood, breathing, and stress levels. This should help organize the data Galaxy Ring already collects more concisely.</p><p>Sometime in the first half of 2025, Samsung will add a new sleep environment report that will use SmartThings-connected devices to add temperature, humidity, air quality, and light intensity to your morning sleep report. To get these, you'll need to have a thermostat, air quality monitor, or light bulbs connected to your Samsung SmartThings account.</p><p>The second half of 2025 will bring another update to the Galaxy Ring that will suggest optimal bedtime and wake-up time based on collected sleep patterns, habits, and conditions. This new analysis should help users sleep better by being on a regular schedule instead of ending the night after a Netflix binge session.</p><p>While it'll be a while before this feature is available, the bright side is that this feature requires existing data for it to work effectively. If nothing, you'll likely have plenty of sleep data for it to analyze by the time Samsung delivers it.</p>

<hr>
<p>ASUS has officially announced the upcoming Zenfone 12 Ultra, a flagship that’s not following the compact phone trend.</p><p>The company revealed the news on X (formerly Twitter) that the Zenfone<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-11-ultra-review"> 12 Ultra will launch on February 6. That’s a bit earlier than last year’s Zenfone</a> 11 Ultra, which came out in March, so it looks like ASUS is pushing up its release schedule.</p>

<p>ASUS' launch announcement comes with a sneak peek at its advanced videography features. A teaser image shows off a feature for 4K video, ensuring the subject stays sharp and clear no matter how the shot moves.</p><p>After ditching the compact design for the larger Zenfone 11 Ultra in 2024, ASUS seems set to stick with this strategy in 2025. There’s no sign of a smaller Zenfone 12 model, with all the buzz and official teasers pointing to the Zenfone 12 Ultra as the main <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship phone</a>.</p><p>Back in August 2024, reports <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2024/08/17/exclusive-asus-zenfone-12-ultra-surfaced-but-its-not-coming-right-away/" target="_blank">surfaced</a> that ASUS started working on the Zenfone 12 Ultra after it showed up in the IMEI database. There’s been talk that the Zenfone 12 Ultra might share some features with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-9-pro-review">ROG Phone 9</a> series, suggesting ASUS could be blending some of its top-tier tech across its flagship devices.</p><p>In November, a Bluetooth SIG listing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/asus-zenfone-12-ultra-bluetooth-sig/" target="_blank">revealed</a> a device with the same model number as the ROG Phone 9 series, sparking rumors that it could be the much-anticipated Zenfone 12 Ultra.</p><p>As for specs, the Zenfone 12 Ultra is expected to pack a punch with the Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, a huge 5,800mAh battery, and a 6.78-inch LTPO AMOLED display. It’ll supposedly have IP68 dust and water resistance for durability, up to 512GB of storage, and 16GB of RAM.</p><p>ASUS also teased the role of AI in the Zenfone 12 Ultra, declaring on X, "Zenfone 12 Ultra unlocks the power of AI, so get ready to step into a new era of mobile photography excellence!"</p>

<hr>
<p>Multiple deadly wildfires in the Los Angeles area led <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/t-mobile">T-Mobile</a> and SpaceX to enable satellite texting for people impacted by the natural disaster in California. The feature uses Starlink satellites and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/t-mobile-customers-direct-to-cell-beta-registration">was set to undergo beta testing by T-Mobile customers</a> early this year. That beta testing period is still on the way, but T-Mobile and SpaceX activated the service for Android users in Los Angeles to help customers stay connected.</p><p>“T-Mobile and Starlink opened up T-Mobile Starlink Direct-to-Cellular service over impacted areas of Southern California to deliver wireless emergency alerts and SMS and enable 911 texting,” T-Mobile told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/t-mobile-and-spacex-turn-on-satellite-texting-for-los-angeles-fires/" target="_blank">CNET</a> on Thursday, Jan. 9 as firefighters struggled to contain the wildfires.</p><p>“While SpaceX's direct-to-cell constellation has not been fully deployed, we are once again temporarily making this early test version available for those who need it most,” the wireless carrier continued.</p><p>Satellite connectivity enables T-Mobile customers with select Android phones to contact loved ones and emergency services when cellular networks are unavailable. T-Mobile told CNET that commercial power loss in the region caused cell networks in and around Los Angeles to go offline, but added that it had "restored roughly half of the sites that were impacted by commercial power loss."</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/starlink-home-internet-review">Starlink</a> also announced the move in a post on X (formerly Twitter). “For those in the Los Angeles area, the Starlink team and T-Mobile have enabled basic texting (SMS) through our Direct to Cell satellites,” the post explains. “You can now text loved ones, text 911, and receive emergency alerts.”</p>

<p>New Year's resolutions have taken on a self-fulfilling prophecy of failure. Cold weather and returning to work sap your motivation.

It's far too easy to turn these features off or stop using them until the guilt of abandoning your 2025 goals ebbs away.</p><p>Smartwatches are only built to reinforce habits and hobbies that you already enjoy, not magically make you love exercise or counting calories.</p>

<p>Despite all that, I believe in using tech and New Year's resolutions to motivate myself. They work for me! I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/tech-and-apps-i-used-to-lose-30-pounds">lost 30 pounds last year</a>, ran more miles, hiked more steps than in 2023, and finished more personal projects — all with a Google Doc of resolutions and a smartwatch to motivate me. Believe it or not, I had <em>fun</em> following my resolutions.</p><p>Keeping in mind that I don't know what <em>your</em> New Year's resolutions for 2025 might be, let me help you "quit quitting" by running through a resolutions template that I think anyone can easily follow and that you can start any time or month, not just January.</p>
<h2 id="set-monthly-goals-with-moving-goalposts-2">Set monthly goals with moving goalposts</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:806px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="wTkUuuKod2TrqjYwKNCyuQ" name="Resolutions-example-steps" alt="A screenshot of a Google Doc file showing goals for hitting certain step counts per month, with bronze, silver, gold, and ace goals for each of the 12 months." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wTkUuuKod2TrqjYwKNCyuQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="806" height="453" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">My Google Doc for my 2025 New Year's resolutions, with dropdown menus for different goal tiers; you can easily organize your own Doc in the same way. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I'm no psychologist, but I think it's pretty obvious that people with the weight and pressure of a <em>year</em>'s expectations will quit when they can't keep up with ambitious goals. If you want to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-walked-10000-steps-a-day-for-one-month">walk 10,000 steps a day</a> to lose weight and then fail to do so a few days in a row, you won't bother restarting because you've already failed!</p><p>Now look at my personal walking and steps resolutions for 2025, above and below. Each month has a main gold-medal target — I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/why-i-challenged-olympics-track-and-field-athletes-and-why-you-should-too">love the Olympics</a> — with bronze and silver offramps for months where I fall short and a level above gold in case I'm feeling especially motivated that month.</p><p>Why organize my goals this way? Simple: Whether your goal is related to steps, calories, or whatever, you're going to have sick days, tough weeks at work, or even whole months where life's roadbumps derail or distract you. So, you need to plan for failure if you want to succeed.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1534px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="UHkJadh2w93hfb5ho4FR5c" name="Resolutions-example" alt="A Google doc file showing my goals for finishing a certain number of hikes and miles walked per year, with bronze, silver, gold, and ace benchmarks for any given month." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UHkJadh2w93hfb5ho4FR5c.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1534" height="863" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">My Google Doc for my 2025 New Year's resolutions, with bronze, silver, gold, and ace tiers for each month. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Even if I'm off my target pace for a given month, I can still hit my lesser targets, so I have a reason to persist. If I have a bad month, I still have 11 other months to shoot for gold; why quit?</p><p>If you're trying to read more books or cook new recipes, it's less daunting to aim for two a month than 20 that year. Maybe you skip a few months or only hit your backup silver goal with one book/recipe that month. But it doesn't matter: you're still outpacing last year when you gave up entirely.</p><p>The same goes for vaguer goals like making an effort to see friends more often or trying to drink or vape less often. Use an artificial monthly goal (only drink X times in January, plan a board game night for February) until it feels more natural without handrails, and don't give up entirely just because you chickened out the first month.</p><p>Eventually, these monthly goals will build a foundation of habits, so you do these things without needing to track them.</p>
<h2 id="treat-your-resolutions-like-a-living-document-2">Treat your resolutions like a living document</h2>
<p>One reason to make your resolutions monthly instead of annual is that you can change your targets if you realize you made them too easy or difficult but still want to keep at it. Plus, you can add <em>new</em> goals at any time.</p><p>It's hard to think about a goal like "swim more at the local pool" or "go hiking more" when it's snowing and the trails are too muddy to climb. Some ideas don't apply — or won't come to you — until months from now.</p><p>My advice is to make more short-term resolutions, like an aspirational to-do list. If you want to try homebrewing beer or joining a local sports league, add it to your resolutions doc with a generous timeframe for when to start or sign up so it doesn't fade out of your mind like other past fancies.</p><p>Adding new resolutions that you can quickly achieve throughout the year — and then moving on to something new — is the best way to keep things fresh. Otherwise, you'll get bored tracking the same stats and goals month after month.</p>
<h2 id="make-your-resolutions-fun-2">Make your resolutions fun</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="vDevfVsBWvJZUefw5yyrq8" name="San-Francisco-Bridge-Half-Marathon-Golden-Gate.jpeg" alt="Me standing in front of the Golden Gate Bridge during the San Francisco Bridge Half Marathon." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vDevfVsBWvJZUefw5yyrq8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Me, running the San Francisco Half Marathon </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>People don't like to think about difficult things, and most resolutions <em>are</em> difficult because they require changing how you lived your life in the past months or years.</p><p>I'm the kind of weirdo who loves running, so aiming to run more miles or beat my fastest half-marathon PR in 2025 is aspirational rather than painful to consider. You should associate your goals with positivity, not a chore or burden, or it's much harder to stick with it.</p><p>If you're invested in difficult resolutions like budgeting or cutting calories, make your overall New Year's resolutions more positive by throwing some fun gimmies onto your list, with no monthly timeline or difficulty curve.</p><p>Some of my resolutions are "beat 20 new video games in 2025" and "finish 12 new seasons of TV shows." It's no effort for me to finish these "resolutions," and I probably would have done so anyway! But that's the point.</p><p>My resolutions Google Doc is full of movies, shows, games, and books that I've been looking forward to. Checking them off my list lets me feel like taking care of my mental health is an accomplishment, and it feels more satisfying than sitting around watching YouTube or TikTok.</p><p>Plus, while I'm deciding which fun thing to do that night, I also scroll through my <em>harder</em> fitness or home improvement goals. Bribing myself with a fun resolution first makes it easier to plan out a difficult workout or project the following day.</p>
<h2 id="use-tech-that-reinforces-your-goals-2">Use tech that reinforces your goals</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="nscnS29GJni7WyKUPAeLU3" name="Garmin-Forerunner-965-walking-streak-2.jpeg" alt="A 31-day walk streak graph on the Garmin Forerunner 965" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nscnS29GJni7WyKUPAeLU3.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I wrote late last year about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-to-use-your-new-cyber-monday-smartwatch-to-shed-thanksgiving-pounds">using fitness tech to shed Thanksgiving pounds</a>, and while that holiday is long past, my advice still applies. Hourly stand reminders, walking more steps, using calorie apps like MyFitnessPal, and other tech tools are accessible ways to get healthier.</p><p>In my case, I use my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a> to guide my runs and then check my monthly stats like mileage, steps, and race times in the app to transfer over to my resolutions doc. It doesn't have to be Garmin; if your smartwatch of choice doesn't organize stats monthly, export to Strava or another fitness app that does because it's too easy to lose track if you log every activity manually.</p><p>Some fitness apps (like Garmin and Strava) have monthly challenges, but I think those are cherry-on-top rewards for working hard, not real motivators. If you start slacking off and stop closing your daily rings or see your VO2 Max fall, it's too easy to refuse to open the app because you know you won't like seeing your results.</p><p>A Google Doc or another note app can always remain open more easily, and you can highlight the stats <em>you</em> care about instead of getting overwhelmed with irrelevant data.</p>

<hr>
<p>YouTube Music just gave the 'Top Songs' section on artist pages a welcome update. The redesign aims to make it easier for fans to dive into an artist's biggest hits.</p><p>Before the update, artist pages showcased a list of five curated Top Songs upfront. You could tap 'More' to see the full list or start playback right away, with tracks flowing smoothly through the 'Up Next' queue.</p><p>The latest change, spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/10/youtube-music-top-songs-2/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, revamps the Top Songs section on artist pages with a scrollable carousel. Each page shows four tracks, and you can swipe through five pages to check out all 20 songs.</p><p>This new layout makes it super easy to check out the top hits of a newly discovered artist since it eliminates the need to tap in order to expand the Top Songs section. All you need to do is swipe through and explore their music effortlessly.</p><p>Nevertheless, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music">YouTube Music</a> keeps it simple with a handy 'Play All' button in the revamped interface, letting you instantly play all the songs in the carousel.</p>
<div class="inlinegallery  inline-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.44%;"><img id="3Ps4ZeMMQaNPMzHhpr5zHS" name="YouTube-Music-top-songs-carousel" alt="YouTube Music top songs carousel on artist pages" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3Ps4ZeMMQaNPMzHhpr5zHS.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="2424" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.44%;"><img id="ohZgeKEroGUJmKZobdG6PS" name="YouTube-Music-top-songs-carousel" alt="YouTube Music top songs carousel on artist pages" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ohZgeKEroGUJmKZobdG6PS.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="2424" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div>
<p>The carousel's design closely mirrors the 'Quick Picks' layout from the Home tab. This cohesive style also carries over to other sections like 'Long listens' and 'Trending.'</p><p>According to 9to5Google, the revamped Top Songs section is widely available on Android and iOS, but some users haven’t seen the new carousel or Play All button yet. Looks like YouTube Music is rolling it out in phases.</p><p>YouTube Music has been on a roll with updates lately. The latest tweak follows the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-music-monthly-audience-stat-test-detailed">introduction of a new "monthly audience" metric</a> on artist pages, giving fans a glimpse into an artist's reach and listener engagement. Late last year, the platform also added a much-requested feature: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-music-gains-a-crucial-feature-for-podcast-listening-and-sharing">shareable links</a>. Now, users can share specific timestamps in songs, podcasts, or other audio, making it easier to recommend the exact moment that hits just right, like the main YouTube app.</p>

<hr>
<p>Fresh reports from China hint at the Oppo Find N5's upcoming launch, and it's tipped to flaunt a super slim design wrapped in a titanium frame.</p><p>Originally rumored for a 2024 release, the Find N5 (from which the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-2">OnePlus Open 2</a> is taking inspiration) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-oneplus-open-2-might-launch-much-later-than-we-hoped">faced some unexpected delays</a>. There were even rumors it might get scrapped altogether. But recent leaks have put those worries to rest, showing that OnePlus and Oppo are still committed to making this book-style foldable a reality.</p><p>In a Weibo <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5121184775012675" target="_blank">post</a>, leaker Digital Chat Station shared that the upcoming Oppo Find N5 will feature a titanium chassis. They also claim that it will be the thinnest foldable phone yet (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/OnePlus-Open-2-World-s-next-thinnest-foldable-smartphone-tipped-to-be-made-with-titanium.945100.0.html" target="_blank">Notebookcheck</a>).</p><p>If these claims hold true, the upcoming Oppo model <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-2-thinner-design-rumors">could dethrone the Honor Magic V3 as the slimmest book-style foldable</a>. The Magic V3 currently measures 9.2mm folded and 4.35mm unfolded. This would set a new benchmark in the foldable market, though the leaker hasn't shared specific dimensions of the upcoming device.</p><p>While previous leaks have teased the OnePlus Open 2's look, they haven't confirmed the materials used. However, the idea of a titanium body seems plausible, given how popular this lightweight yet durable metal has become in premium phones.</p><p>Titanium’s strength and lightness make it a top pick for flagships like the Galaxy S24 Ultra and the upcoming S25 Ultra. So, if the OnePlus Open 2 uses titanium, it would fit right in with the latest design trends and further cement its status as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">premium foldable</a>.</p><p>In a separate Weibo <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/5888095979/P8MOkkQkw" target="_blank">post</a>, leaker Smart Pikachu shared a detailed look at the device’s key features. The design focuses on durability, with a triple-camera setup co-engineered with Hasselblad, including a periscope lens for better optics.</p><p>The tipster also claims that the phone will be powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset and support satellite communication. It could also pack a "nearly 6,000mAh" battery with wireless charging support.</p><p>Smart Pikachu also hinted at a February 2025 launch for the Oppo Find N5. This timing gives OnePlus a solid chance to lead the foldable market. With the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 not expected until later in the year, the Open 2 could have a strong, uncontested run, helping it grab market share and build a loyal following before its biggest competitor arrives.</p>

Unlike their larger foldable counterparts that open to reveal a larger tablet-like display, these phones go for a more compact approach by shrinking down to half their size, often with a cover screen for basic controls over notifications and more.</p><p>There isn't much in the way of added functionality as you get with larger foldables, but flip phones go for the "less is more" approach, which I have become quite enamored with in recent years. In the absence of compact "mini" phones, flip phones offer a nice medium, in a sense offering the best of both worlds.</p><p>However, while the experience of using one is fun, flip phones are far from perfect, and in some ways, they are a half step down from a conventional smartphone. Companies like Samsung and Motorola have worked for years to bring <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phones</a> up to speed with traditional smartphone models, and I think they're almost there.</p><p>So, what do I think a perfect flip phone look like, and could we achieve this?</p>

<h2 id="size-matters-2">Size matters</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4149px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vbzXkAgieD2nDxmoFAFZfC" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-review-13.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 folded on a ledge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vbzXkAgieD2nDxmoFAFZfC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4149" height="2334" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Flip phones are often seen as a more compact version of a conventional smartphone, which is true in some aspects. After all, you're basically folding down a phone to half its size. However, that introduces a new problem: the phone becomes twice as thick when folded.</p><p>This isn't that big of a problem with larger <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> (unless you're Samsung) because there's enough area to spread out the batteries and other components so that folding the phone gives you roughly the same thickness as a traditional smartphone, with the device getting <em>thinner</em> when unfolded.</p><p>With flip phones, the opposite occurs, and the phone gets thicker because you have to somehow squeeze two batteries, two displays, a folding hinge mechanism, and all the other components into the same size as a regular phone. The result is a phone that's often thicker than a folded <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> and even a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> (which is saying something).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4221px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="YRQTJ9P6J9rk777bFSQAcR" name="Google-Pixel-9-Pro-Fold-Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-hinge.jpg" alt="Pixel 9 Pro Fold next to the Razr Plus 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YRQTJ9P6J9rk777bFSQAcR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4221" height="2374" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The downside of this is that in my pocket, the phone doesn't take up as much surface area, which is nice, but it does protrude a lot more, which can look a little funny. More importantly, this thickness has prevented me from consistently using cases on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review" target="_blank">Razr Plus 2024</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review" target="_blank">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> because they just add even more thickness to the phones. And while I love how the Razr feels without a case, I'd feel much better having one on than not, but not if it makes the phone unnecessarily bulky.</p><p>My hope is that, somehow, some way, companies are able to minimize the thickness of the phones, perhaps by using thinner and denser batteries or tweaking the hinge designs even further. Of course, this has to be done without trade-offs like reduced battery life or compromising the integrity of the device.</p><p>I don't expect this to be figured out in 2025, but I hope to see companies working toward this goal</p>

<p>I've never been a fan of the tall 22:9 aspect ratio that flip phones have adopted. It's one thing when Sony started going with 21:9 aspect ratios on Xperia phones to achieve a more "cinematic" look, but there doesn't seem to be an aesthetic reason behind the tall screens on flip phones.</p><p>I find tall phones to be a bit of a nuisance for the simple reason that I tend to use my phone one-handed, and I know I'm not alone in this. It's one thing to have a display closing in on seven inches, but it's another thing to make it so that I have to completely shift the way I'm holding my phone in order to reach UI elements toward the top of the display.</p><p>Of course, we could start asking OEMs and developers to start changing their UI to better accommodate this, but that's an article for another time.</p><p>One flip phone that I think nailed this is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-moto-razr-2022-launch">Motorola Razr 2022</a>, which features a more natural-feeling 20:9 aspect ratio. It's a bummer that the phone never made it to the States and that Motorola switched to the taller aspect ratio in subsequent models, but I hope companies can move away from this</p>

<p>Flip phones aren't known for having the best cameras, especially when compared to more traditional flagship smartphones, and it's really a shame. After all, I'm spending the same amount of money or more for a foldable, so I should have camera quality that matches the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-camera">best Android camera phones</a>.</p><p>That's not to say it's all bad; in fact, flip phone cameras are getting better, as we've seen with the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Motorola Razr Plus 2024. It's not just a flip phone thing; companies like Google and Samsung tend to skimp out on camera sensors when it comes to foldable phones. It could be a size constraint thing or a cost issue, but either way, something's gotta change if we're gonna continue to shell out $1,000+ for a phone just to get lower-quality cameras.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3932px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="sxSwtaPe4AoDHdJBCD9iT8" name="OPPO-Find-N3-Flip-review-12.jpg" alt="OPPO Find N3 Flip tented from the side" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sxSwtaPe4AoDHdJBCD9iT8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3932" height="2212" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Not only that but flip phones are often constrained by the number of cameras they offer. Most tend to sport two rear cameras, and while a select few from companies like OPPO and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-pocket-2-launch">Huawei</a> have offered a third sensor, it's certainly not the norm. I would love to see more flip phones with a telephoto camera in addition to a wide and ultrawide.</p><p>Samsung has sort of worked out a happy medium with the Z Flip 6 by improving the digital zoom quality using AI. It's a decent effort to get past the lack of a dedicated telephoto camera, but a software solution can only go so far.</p><p>If you want a good camera system, you would actually save money by purchasing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review">Galaxy S24 Plus</a>, which has a third sensor and pretty great cameras. Even the cheapest "entry-level" flagship <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a> comes with a triple-camera system — with a 3x telephoto camera — and costs hundreds less, highlighting the discrepancy between traditional smartphones and flip phones.</p>
<h2 id="the-other-camera-problem-2">The other camera problem</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="66FMYDhBrM6ELGfymJGhCn" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-review-10.jpg" alt="Google Messages on the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/66FMYDhBrM6ELGfymJGhCn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As much as I would like to see more cameras on flip phones, that introduces a new problem that OEMs have to figure out: where are these cameras going?</p><p>Because of the ever-expanding cover screens on flip phones, OEMs have to get creative when it comes to the placement of the camera modules. The cameras have to hold space on the same square cover panel as the external display, and they can't obstruct the cover screen experience too much. OEMs have tried different methods with varying levels of success, but they all seem to have downsides.</p><p>The Razr Plus 2024 has one of the largest external screens you'll find on a flip phone, but because it takes up the <em>entire</em> cover panel, the company opted for cutouts for the cameras and flash. It works mostly fine, but because the cameras tend to cover certain app elements, Motorola lets you shift the app upwards in a condensed view to access that part of the app. Again, it works fine when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-set-up-use-motorola-razr-cover-screen-apps">using apps on the Razr cover screen</a>, but it's an extra step when doing something like sending a message and trying to tap the <strong>Send</strong> button, often located on the bottom right side.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vpvT2fjNbbhfNrHPegS9E8" name="TECNO-Phantom-V-Flip-2-review-15.jpg" alt="TECNO Phantom V Flip 2 cover screen with YouTube Music" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vpvT2fjNbbhfNrHPegS9E8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For the Galaxy Z Flip 6, Samsung went with an awkward cutout on the cover screen to avoid the cameras completely. The problem with this method is that the overall <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-set-up-and-use-apps-on-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-cover-screen">app experience on the cover screen</a> feels uncomfortably scrunched up. Meanwhile, other companies like OPPO and TECNO moved their external displays or software experiences to one side of the cover panel to avoid the cameras, providing a fully vertical app view. While it seemingly makes more sense, just about every app element is minimized, which actually feels less convenient in actual use.</p><p>So, how can we have both a large cover screen and a multi-camera system on a flip phone without one obstructing the other? The only way I can imagine this might work is to adopt under-display cameras so they won't get in the way, providing an unrestricted cover screen experience. Unfortunately, that could result in degraded camera quality, which takes me back to my previous problem with flip phones.</p>

<p>As I've stated, flip phones have come a long way from where they started, and I've been happy to see companies like Samsung and Motorola improve year after year.</p><p>In addition to improved camera quality, flip phones have become much more durable and are not able to withstand drops better. They can also be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-the-motorola-razr-plus-2024-waterproof">fully submerged in water</a>, and we've even started seeing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-waterproof">official dust resistance</a> ratings appear on phones, which should give consumers more peace of mind.</p><p>Battery life is one area that still lags, but that's slowly improving as well. In fact, companies have managed to catch up with and even exceed some traditional flagship smartphones. Samsung and Motorola fit 4,000mAh batteries into last year's models, bringing roughly all-day battery life to their phones. TECNO and Xiaomi took it to the next level with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-phanton-v-flip-2-review">Phantom V Flip 2</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-announces-mix-flip-and-mix-fold-4">Mix Flip</a>, offering massive 4,720mah and 4,780mAh batteries, respectively.</p><p>Those two phones also feature 70W and 67W charging, much faster than the speeds on Samsung's top-end <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>.</p>

<p>Flip phones are also reaching lower prices, making it a great time to buy one if you've been on the fence. With phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2024-review">Motorola Razr 2024</a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nubia-flip-5g-review">Nubia Flip 5G</a>, you can snag a foldable for as low as $500. That's about the same as you'd pay for some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best cheap Android phones</a> that don't flip, except now you get a much more interesting smartphone.</p><p>These are just some of the ways we've seen flip phones evolve over the years since their resurgence. With these changes and improvements, flip phones are becoming much more mainstream than their larger-screened foldable counterparts, and I can't wait to see how the form factor improve in 2025 and beyond.</p>
<h2 id="my-perfect-flip-phone-2">My perfect flip phone</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="aPWe8Qrh2AMDzZjTbs6aY6" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-vs-Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-4.jpg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 next to the Motorola Razr Plus 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aPWe8Qrh2AMDzZjTbs6aY6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now that I've outlined my current issues with flip phones and the ways the form factor has improved, it's got me thinking about what my perfect flip phone would look like in an ideal world where I could have my way when designing and building my own phone without restrictions.</p><p>Of course, no phone is perfect (although some of them come close), and my thoughts are likely to change throughout the year and in years to follow. For now, this is what I would like to see in a flip phone:</p><p>The device would feature a design similar to the Motorola Razr Plus 2024, complete with curved edges and an expansive cover screen. It would have a 6.7-inch display with a 20:9 aspect ratio and measure no more than 11mm when folded (roughly half that when unfolded).</p><p>The battery would have a capacity of no less than 4,000mAh, and the phone would charge at 67W with support for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/samsung-galaxy-s25-could-bring-qi2-revolution">Qi2</a> (with built-in magnets).</p><p>There would be three 50MP rear cameras hidden under the cover screen, including wide, ultrawide, and telephoto sensors, with camera quality matching something like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>. The front-facing camera would also be an under-display unit.</p><p>The UI? <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a>, but with the ability to natively run apps out of the box without needing to rely on Good Lock.</p><p>Basically, I want a phone built by Motorola with Samsung's software and Google's (or OnePlus's) cameras. Much of this sounds a bit farfetched, although who knows what flip phones will look like in a few years, especially when Google and Apple decide to launch their own models. Until then, I'll be looking forward to whatever Motorola or Samsung bring us in 2025.</p>

<ul><li>Google dropped Android 15 QPR2 Beta 2.1 to fine-tune connectivity, customization, performance, and stability in the beta channel.</li><li>The update includes January 2025 security patches and fixes issues like app crashes, freezes, and random reboots.</li><li>It also fixes a weird bug where Emoji Workshop settings pop up when changing wallpapers.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1hxn904/android_15_qpr2_beta_21_now_available/" target="_blank">pushed out</a> Android 15 QPR2 Beta 2.1 to Pixels mainly to fix some pesky bugs.</p><p>The latest update <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-qpr2-beta-2-is-here-with-our-first-look-at-the-working-linux-terminal-app">builds on Android 15 and QPR2</a>, bringing tweaks to improve connectivity, customization, performance, and overall stability in the beta channel. For developers, it’s their chance to test apps against the new features and system changes, making sure everything runs smoothly for users.</p><p>This release is pretty light on changes compared to the big QPR2 Beta 2 list, but that’s what you’d expect from a point release like this.</p><p>This update, with the build number BP11.241121.013, packs in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/january-2025-security-patch-rolling-out-for-google-pixel-devices-heres-whats-fixed">January 2025 security patches</a> along with Pixel-specific tweaks. The main focus is to fix those annoying issues like apps crashing, system freezes, and random reboots that some beta users have been dealing with.</p><p>Here's what's fixed:</p>
<ul><li>Fixed several issues that sometimes caused a device to freeze, crash, or restart unexpectedly. (Issue #380500068, Issue #381894854, Issue #378856187, Issue #384447026, Issue #384885640, Issue #385056337, Issue #385126181)</li><li>Fixed an issue where the Emoji Workshop options opened when selecting wallpapers from other categories in system settings. (Issue #384629413)</li><li>Fixed various other issues that were impacting system stability and connectivity.</li></ul>
<p>On top of that, this update fixes a weird bug where the Emoji Workshop settings would randomly pop up when choosing a new wallpaper.</p><p>This update also brings some solid improvements to system stability and network reliability.</p><p>Like previous Android 15 updates, this one works with the Pixel 6, 7, 8, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">9 series</a>, as well as the Pixel Fold, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>, and Pixel Tablet. If you’ve got one of these devices and want to try out the beta, just head to Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/android/beta" target="_blank">registration page</a>. There, you can pick the device you want to use for testing out the beta updates.</p>

<p>That's why you might have seen news about Samsung's "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-phone-subscription-club-service-detailed">phone subscription</a>" in the news this week. Thanks to some rather questionable articles on the matter, people assumed that Samsung was introducing some sort of subscription pricing to use the phones we're about to see at Galaxy Unpacked.</p><p>To be very clear — we're not. This is <strong>only</strong> for special AI services, even if it makes its way to the U.S. I hate that we call this a phone subscription because it's not; it's a software subscription that is no different than what Adobe or Norton offer for your PC. Phone stuff is weird sometimes.</p>
<p>Enough about what the AI Club is and that it might expand. Let's talk about the reaction. Why do people hate it when Samsung does the exact same thing that Apple and Google already are doing, for the same type of service?</p><p>If you use a new iPhone, you can use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">Apple Intelligence</a> features free until 2027, but to get the most from it you can connect it to a paid ChatGPT subscription that costs $20 a month.</p><p>If you use an Android phone in select countries, you can use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google Gemini</a> for free. To get the most from Gemini, you can subscribe to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One</a> plan that includes Gemini Advanced, which costs $20 a month.</p><p>Samsung has already said that all Galaxy AI features are free for phone and tablet users until at least the end of 2025. It <em>might</em> include an AI subscription tier in South Korea.</p><p>If it's OK for Apple and Google, it should be OK for Samsung.</p>

<p>Judging by the internet tech prosumer reaction, it's clearly not OK for Samsung to do it. That's because of the way we view Samsung in the West.</p><p>When you think of Samsung, you probably think of phones and the parts used to make phones. Samsung is well known as an electronics manufacturer and almost every phone has some Samsung parts inside of it. Even an iPhone.</p><p>Samsung is really good at this, too. There is no consumer outrage about the performance of a Samsung display on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16</a>. Samsung's memory and controllers are great and part of what makes your flagship phone so fast. The company's phones and tablets are no slouch either, and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> is one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best you can buy</a>.</p>
<p>When it comes to software, there isn't the same enthusiasm. The company seems to have finally built a great version of Android with recent versions of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI</a>, but most tech enthusiasts don't use Samsung's phone software very much or at all.</p><p>Samsung's apps are like the Stocks app on an iPhone and end up crammed in a junk folder if they can't be disabled. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/bixby">Bixby</a> (which isn't really that bad) is a laughing stock among Android enthusiasts, and what Samsung did to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsungs-tizen-powered-z1-rival-android-one-if-not-all-android">Tizen</a> should send some people straight to Dante's Inferno.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure pull-right inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="vCKKSdoGMEBfAG7KTfHgtE" name="tizen-z1-1.jpg" alt="Tizen on a Samsung phone." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vCKKSdoGMEBfAG7KTfHgtE.jpg" mos="" align="right" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1536" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-right expandable"></p></div></div></figure>
<p>This is what U.S. tech enthusiasts think of Samsung's software. You don't have to look very hard to find people saying they wish they could buy a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> that runs Google's Pixel version of Android, and there are plenty of people trying to hack just that onto their expensive phones. Most consumers don't know any better or even care and just use what's there, but die-hard techies are the people who get vocal on the internet about everything.</p>
<p>I would never pay for an AI subscription, at least until it offers more than a different way to feed me information that's already available. When that happens, I don't care if Samsung, Apple, or Google offers it — I'll buy whatever suits my needs best.</p><p>More than likely, we won't have to worry about this at all here in North America and this was just a handy excuse to complain about Samsung and AI in general.</p>

First, the specs of the devices leaked online, followed by the full renders with over 75 odd pictures of what we think is the actual Samsung S25 series.</p><p>The morning of Jan. 10 started off with pictures of official renders of the alleged Samsung Galaxy S25 series that were posted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-design" target="_blank">Android Headlines</a>. First up we see the S25 Ultra pictures that show rounded corners and an entirely flat display and sides for the phone. The back of the device is shown with its rumored four-camera array and lenses that could have black rims. The publication states the Galaxy S25 Ultra could see the following colors upon release: Titanium Black, Titanium Gray, Titanium Silver Blue, and Titanium White Silver.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus pictures reveal that they look a lot like their previous models, and each device features rounded corners, a triple camera array, and thin bezels. However, the only visible change is with the lenses, as those could grab the same black rings as the Ultra model. They are said to come in four colorways: Silver Shadow, Ice Blue, Navy, and Mint.</p>

<p>Along with the renders, the entire spec sheet of the models was also leaked by the same publication. The trio's entire spec sheet shows that the Ultra is rumored to grab a 6.9-inch screen with a 120Hz refresh rate. For its cameras, the device could see a 200MP primary lens, a 50MP ultra-wide-angle camera, a 50MP periscope telephoto camera, and a 10MP telephoto.</p><p>The S25 and S25 Plus could see a 6.2-inch Full HD Plus display and a 6.7-inch display, respectively. They will have a triple camera array featuring a 50MP primary camera, a 12MP ultra-wide-angle camera, and a 10MP telephoto lens. Both handsets will also have a 12MP selfie shooter on the front.</p>

"We can expect an acceleration in Android devices with Qi2 built in during 2025," the presser stated.</p><p>That said, part of the announcement was to highlight the new Qi2 Ready, which gives Android OEMs a workaround to bring Qi2 without embedding magnets into the phone. Instead, they'll have to use magnetic cases to bring full Qi2 compliance.</p><p>Samsung also stated in the press release that it will bring phones with the new charging standard.</p><p>"You can expect to see Android devices supporting Qi2 from Samsung Galaxy devices in 2025." This could only hint that the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Samsung Galaxy S25</a> series could be the first Galaxy phones to be compatible with Qi2 wireless charging and accessories. This could also be the start of a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/samsung-galaxy-s25-could-bring-qi2-revolution">major Qi2 revolution</a> after last year's HMD Skyline. And Samsung isn't the only phone brand helping bring Qi2 to more Android phones.</p><p>Google is doing the same, "Google is committed to the Qi2 wireless charging standard and increasing the penetration of Qi2 into Android handsets and other devices," the company said in a press release.</p><p>"Google is helping to achieve this goal by playing a leading role in the development of the upcoming Qi v2.2 standard, which includes Google's contribution of its own high-power wireless charging technology to WPC."</p>

It finally upgraded the PWM dimming rate to match the iPhone, and Samsung's new anti-glare filter made it easier to see in the sunlight.</p><p>But problems were brewing under the surface and have slowly cropped up over the last year, leading us to wonder if Samsung will fix them in the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a> series.</p><p>From grainy displays to dull colors, Samsung has some work to do on the quality and configuration of the display itself. We've also seen Galaxy S24 Ultra models with permanent smudge marks on the screen, a sign that the oil-resistant layer is wearing off prematurely.</p><p>Lastly, Samsung continues to be one of the only remaining companies that don't offer eye-friendly dimming options for folks sensitive to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a> and flickering LEDs. Here's everything Samsung needs to improve on the Galaxy S25 Ultra's display to retake the crown for the phone with the best display.</p>
<h2 id="grainy-displays-2">Grainy displays</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1796px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="HaN6EnSjhANoWUyrqSgZPc" name="samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-display-mura.jpg" alt="An extreme close up of the Galaxy S24 Ultra's panel at a brightness under 10%." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HaN6EnSjhANoWUyrqSgZPc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1796" height="1010" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Early on, users complained of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-grainy-mura-problem-reported">grainy displays</a>. While this is mostly noticeable at low brightness levels, some users have noted that they can see the grain even at regular or high brightness. This problem, technically known as "mura," is one we haven't seen so widely since the days of the Google Pixel 2 XL and it persists on Galaxy S24 Ultra displays today. You can see the uneven pattern in the image above which I captured using a microscope on my Galaxy S24 Ultra.</p><p>The grainy issue is caused by manufacturing defects where adjacent pixels aren't as bright as each other, making it look spotty or grainy. Pixels on an OLED are all individually lit and part of the manufacturing and calibration process is ensuring that each pixel meets a specific uniformity level.</p><p>It's not clear if Samsung is skipping this step or if the M13 generation is just particularly prone to this graininess issue. What is clear, however, is that no other phone with an OLED screen suffers from this issue in such a major way. One <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammyfans.com/2024/11/18/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-fixes-grainy-display-without-m14-oled/">November rumor</a> says that Samsung fixed the problem in the Galaxy S25 Ultra by using M13+ panels, but we'll have to wait and see if that's the case.</p>
<h2 id="permanent-smudges-2">Permanent smudges</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="WYyF49Mn6WpPDz9jXKmFEG" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-smudgy-screen" alt="Smudges on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra's screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WYyF49Mn6WpPDz9jXKmFEG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Everyone has had to wipe down their smartphone display from time to time to remove smudges and dirt, but some unfortunate Galaxy S24 Ultra users have found that the smudges on their screens <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-display-coating-premature-wear-out-3509276/">never go away</a>.</p><p>This is believed to be caused by a premature degradation of the oleophobic coating on the outside of the display. This coating is applied to glass to keep fingerprints and smudges at a minimum, as it's naturally resistant to water, oils, and other liquids.</p><p>The result is a display that looks permanently dirty, and only a replacement of the glass will fix the issue. Worse yet, an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/galaxy-s24-ultra-display-smudge-poll-results-3511629/">Android Authority poll</a> shows that potentially 50% or more of Galaxy S24 Ultra users are experiencing this problem. Our advice for Galaxy S24 Ultra owners without this problem is to get a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-galaxy-s24-ultra-screen-protectors">good Galaxy S24 Ultra screen protector</a> on your phone immediately.</p><p>Samsung <em>needs</em> to fix this problem on the Galaxy S25 Ultra. It's non-negotiable for a $1,200+ smartphone.</p>
<h2 id="better-dimming-options-2">Better dimming options</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="t9cRdEYEm2C7PAfierAyAU" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-one-ui-7-multitasking-01" alt="The new multitasking UI in One UI 7 on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/t9cRdEYEm2C7PAfierAyAU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As more and more research piles up, it's clear that using PWM dimming on displays and LED bulbs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/late-2024-led-flicker-research-smartphones">is causing health problems</a>. Since I began writing about this problem nearly two years ago, I've been able to help lots of people get rid of the headaches they'd been experiencing daily by recommending smartphones and light bulbs that don't flicker.</p><p>Unfortunately, Samsung is one of the worst offenders of flickering displays. Those displays are only getting harsher and more painful every year since companies are obsessed with making them <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-display">brighter and brighter</a>. The solution is extraordinarily simple, but Samsung so far has refused to talk about it or make any sort of accessibility changes for the betterment of its users' long-term health.</p><p>U.S. users, in particular, have almost no flicker-free options to choose from since Samsung, Google, and Apple all now equip every phone they make with flickering displays. Samsung has a real opportunity to get things right with the Galaxy S25 series and take the lead on eye health as the largest smartphone manufacturer in the world.</p><p>If companies like OnePlus, Nothing, Vivo, Xiaomi, Oppo, and many other brands can do it, Samsung can too.</p>
<h2 id="don-t-forget-the-fans-2">Don't forget the fans</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="4gpMuHf4NvR79YBDgV2mkc" name="samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-good-lock-module.jpg" alt="S24 Ultra showcasing Good Lock modules" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4gpMuHf4NvR79YBDgV2mkc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The last problem is the least egregious but one that probably irritated fans the most. At launch, the Galaxy S24 Ultra's display <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-washed-out-display-is-intentional">was duller than previous Galaxy flagships</a>.</p><p>I praised the more realistic colors of the display in my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra review</a>, and while Samsung did an excellent job of tweaking the colors to make them more realistic, the company seemingly forgot that some of its users love vibrant, highly saturated colors.</p><p>Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/first-major-galaxy-s24-patch">released a patch</a> about a month after the S24 Ultra's release addressing the issue and providing a vibrancy slider for folks that wanted bolder colors. Hopefully, the company won't forget this option when it launches the Galaxy S25 Ultra sometime soon.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The United States has added technology giant China-based Tencent to a list of companies designated as partners with the Chinese military, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-06/us-adds-tencent-to-chinese-military-blacklist-shares-decline">according to Bloomberg</a>.</p><p>Tencent is one of the ten biggest companies in the world, with ownership or investment in multiple game developers and publishers, and is the developer of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-wechat-and-why-trump-banning-it">WeChat</a>, one of the world's largest social media and messaging platforms.</p><p>Previously, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tiktok-wechat-be-banned-us-app-stores-sunday-september-20">WeChat was specifically named to be banned</a> along with TikTok by the first Trump administration, but this was halted by a federal judge and officially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/biden-undos-trumps-wechat-and-tiktok-bans">undone by the Biden administration. </a></p><p>Now, it appears the whole mess is happening again, albeit for a different reason this time.</p>
<p>In the past, concerns over WeChat centered around data collection and retention by China. This time, Tencent — WeChat's parent company — is under scrutiny because the U.S. thinks it has ties to the Chinese military. In statements to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337489/tencent-catl-us-defense-department-chinese-military-companies">The Verge</a> and Bloomberg, Tencent has denied these allegations and says it will work with the Department of Defense to be removed from this list.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.50%;"><img id="XLxKLTsUMCHMojknJA2bxG" name="tencent.jpg" alt="Tencent hallway" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XLxKLTsUMCHMojknJA2bxG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="532" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Zhu Min / Zuma Press)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In the meantime, being on the list doesn't block anyone from using Tencent's services or gaming titles. You can still play Valorant or League of Legends, and WeChat use in the States won't be interrupted in any way. It does, however, deal quite a blow to a company's reputation in the West, and Tencent's stock prices fell over seven percentage points with the news.</p>
<p>So what <em>does</em> this mean? WeChat is the brand most affected by anything that happens with Tencent because it is the company's biggest platform by far. With approximately 1 billion users in China alone, the platform dwarfs most other services of its type. It's worth noting that there are also over 4 million WeChat users in the U.S. who would be affected by any governmental action against Tencent.</p><p>Which could be coming. The Trump 2.0 administration will be as unpredictable as it was the first time whenever it comes to dealings with China. We could see this develop into a fill-on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/huawei-losing-access-android-updates-google-support-after-trump-trade-ban">Huawei-style banning</a> should the president decide to do it. We could also see it just go away if it's shown that Tencent really doesn't belong on this list. That is exactly what happened with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/xiaomi-latest-be-blacklisted-trump-administration">Xiaomi</a> when it was found to have been added in error in 2021.</p><p>Tencent was also in hot water with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/tencent-removes-two-directors-epic-games-and-relinquishes-its-right-unilaterally-appoint">Department of Justice</a>, which claims there are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-plans-get-epic-games-antitrust-motion-dismissed">antitrust</a> violations with the way Tencent and Epic Games (Tencent owns 35% of Epic) were running their Board of Directors. This has no direct relationship with the addition to any DoD lists but is ammunition should further action be considered.</p><p>In short, if you use WeChat on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">your phone</a> you don't have anything to worry about yet. Tomorrow, however, is another day.</p>

<ul><li>Shokz announced the OpenFit 2 wireless open-ear earbuds at CES 2025 on Tuesday.</li><li>The OpenFit 2 have 11 hours of battery per charge, dual low- and high-frequency drivers in each earbud, and IP55 water resistance.</li><li>The new earbuds are 1g heavier but have improved Bluetooth, tweaked earhooks, and a new physical button for controls.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Shokz announced the successor to my favorite wireless earbuds at CES 2025 on Tuesday, but it took me three days to see the news. Even though I'm out of the loop, I decided to cover the announcement late. I'm just that excited about it.</p><p>Ever since I reviewed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/shokz-openfit-review">Shokz OpenFit</a> wireless earbuds in late 2023, I've abandoned my old earbuds and worn them almost exclusively. Over a year of wearing them for training runs, hikes, and races, I've grown dependent upon their open-ear fit for keeping my situational awareness and letting my eardrums relax, while acknowledging some annoying flaws with them over time.</p><p>Now it looks like the Shokz OpenFit 2 will fix most (if not all) of my complaints with the first-gen earbuds.</p><p>Like the original OpenFit and the cheaper <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/shokz-openswim-pro-and-openfit-air-review">OpenFit Air</a>, the OpenFit 2 has a silicone earhook that lets the speaker sit directly over your ear, directing sound inside while leaving it open to hear your surroundings. It's a nice alternative to bone conduction headphones (like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/shokz-openrun-pro-2-review">Shokz OpenRun Pro 2</a>) if you're not a fan of them.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Shokz OpenFit have a relatively average battery life, finicky touch controls that frequently lead to dropped phone calls, and softer sound compared to in-ear earbuds. They also sometimes refuse to charge and stay connected to your phone while in the charging case, or die if they sit too long without the case being charged.</p>

<p>I'm waiting to hear back from a Shokz rep if that notorious charging connector issue has been fixed, as the OpenFit 2 charging case has the same look and 48-hour capacity as the first generation. But on every other front, the OpenFit 2 should be a major improvement.</p><p>It jumps from 7 to 11 hours of streaming per charge, with a 270-day standby time in-case instead of 10 days. They've added a physical button with single-, double-, and triple-click shortcuts like pausing music or answering phone calls; now the touchpad only controls volume and your voice assistant, which is a relief.</p><p>Most importantly for audiophiles, it adds two drivers instead of one, targeting lows and highs, with a larger bass driver than before and "OpenBass 2.0" tech to "enhance dynamic low-frequency vibrations directly into your ear."</p><p>I personally felt the OpenFit had good-enough audio quality with the bass boost EQ setting, and cared more about the eardrum comfort and unimpeded awareness than perfect surround sound. The OpenFit 2 will provide a lovely little boost for first-gen fans, but probably won't satisfy those who prefer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones-working-out">workout earbuds</a> with a proper seal and artificial transparency modes for richer sound, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/jabra-elite-8-active-gen-2-review">Jabra Elite 8 Active Gen 2</a>.</p><p>Other new upgrades include a redesigned flexible earhook that's supposed to "ensure a secure fit" with new, softer silicone than before, along with a jump from IP54 to IP55 water resistance (handling water jets instead of splashes) and new Bluetooth 5.4 support for triple the range away from your phone.</p><p>I intend to review the Shokz OpenFit 2 soon and see if they deliver on the company's promised improvements. But consider me quite optimistic, simply because the upgrades seem to directly address many first-gen users' complaints, including mine.</p>

This version costs the same but lasts longer, hits a louder and deeper sound, and can withstand more water and sweat.</p></p>
