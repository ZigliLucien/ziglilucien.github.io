I admit I fell off wearing my smart glasses in recent months as I relied more on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/shokz-openfit-2-review">Shokz OpenFit 2s</a> for open-ear streaming. But I decided better sun protection and the chance to snap a few photos mid-race would make them worth dusting off.</p><p>I ended up happy that I wore them, but the experience also reminded me why I typically only wear them in casual settings, <em>not</em> runs or workouts. I'm waiting to see if the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-with-display-rumor">3rd-gen Meta glasses</a> can do any better later this year, with or without the AR tech.</p><h2 id="snapping-away-2">Snapping away</h2><p>Things started off great. Despite being heavier than my regular glasses, my Wayfarer-style <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Metas</a> felt comfortable and covered up my eye bags for selfies after my 5am wake-up call. And at a race where everyone is snapping photos or breaking out their GoPros, I was less worried than usual about creeping people out with subtle glasses photography.</p><div class="inlinegallery

yank my phone out of my pocket and line up the viewfinder. I rarely take photographs during races when I'm focused on staying in the zone, but I ended up taking 22 photos and one finish-line video by the end.</p><p>San Jose is the farthest thing from a scenic course for good photos, but I wanted to test how these glasses performed before bringing them to, say, Big Sur or NYC.</p><p>I also streamed my Half Marathon playlist during the race to keep me motivated, but with my ears fully uncovered to hear anyone trying to pass me and courteously avoid stumbling into them. Since most races "highly discourage" or outright ban headphones, this is a real perk.</p><p>But wearing Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses during the race had its fair share of cons, too.</p><h2 id="my-three-main-issues-with-wearing-smart-glasses-during-a-race-2">My three main issues with wearing smart glasses during a race</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Zbs6FE7iQYqfKbPUdVcGua" name="Ray-Ban-Meta-Smart-Glasses-close-up.jpeg" alt="A close-up of the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Zbs6FE7iQYqfKbPUdVcGua.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I tend not to wear my normal glasses during runs because I can see well enough that it's never felt worth buying a strap to avoid them sliding down my nose. With my 50g Ray-Bans, it's clear I'll need to buy and strap on this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ray-ban.com/usa/accessories/ARB0002STray-ban%20lanyard-/8056597950282">thick, dorky lanyard</a> before I try another race with them.</p><p>They stayed in place for maybe 400m, but once my nose got sweaty, they started slipping. If I pushed them up, I immediately felt the weight bouncing and jiggling on my nose bridge before they slid down again.</p><p>I kept them in place by keeping my head tilted slightly up like some snooty nobleman in a BBC period piece, but it did take me a bit out of the zone to feel so rigid. And even if I wore the lanyard and they stayed in place, I suspect they'd still bounce uncomfortably because of the weight.</p><figure class="van-image-figure pull-right inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:133.33%;"><img id="NjqfQwqkz4bVz4FKeAvb4e" name="Meta-Ray-Ban-glasses-half-marathon-camera-sample-2" alt="A Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses camera sample at the San Jose Half Marathon showing the lead runners of the race in the far distance." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NjqfQwqkz4bVz4FKeAvb4e.jpg" mos="" align="right" fullscreen="1" width="3000" height="4000" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-right expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class="pull-right inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>My second problem is less dire: with no viewfinder, it's easy to forget in the moment that you need to get up close and personal with your Ray-Bans to get a clear photo. I would see something cool and snap a photo, only to later have to squint and zoom in just to remember what my subject was amidst the landscape.</p><p>In this photo, for example, I saw the lead runners finishing their out-and-back the other way and thought it'd be cool to capture them. But they're barely noticeable and blurry because I took the shot from way too far back.</p><p>The resolution is great for glasses, and the ultrawide effect recreates the feeling of standing in a memory rather than composing a photo. In particular, my video of the final sprint, which I can't embed here (sorry), looked startlingly smooth compared to how it felt in the moment.</p><p>The point being, I'm still glad I wore them. I can jog my memory of the course without having to pay $50 for photos of me panting past camerapeople. Next time, I'll know that I need to position myself <strong>right next</strong> to the subject first, or else the photo won't turn out well.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="osCcj5UBZceAcax3mf6NyS" name="ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-with-charging-case" alt="Special edition transparent Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses with their black leather charging case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/osCcj5UBZceAcax3mf6NyS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The real deal-breaker, though, is battery life. I took my Ray-Bans out of the case about 15 minutes before the start and didn't use them until then. At that point, I streamed music and took 22 photos and one video throughout my 1 hour 54-minute race, plus one accidental Meta AI trigger. As I cooled down, I checked my battery life: 8%.</p><p>Meta estimates its glasses will last four hours with "moderate" use and the right conditions, including "100 videos or up to 500 photos per full charge."</p><p>Smart glasses struggle with battery life in cold weather, but I wouldn't call mid-60ºF cold. Streaming music was part of the problem, so maybe I could wear my Ray-Bans <em>and</em> earbuds for another race and use the glasses solely for photography. I also forgot to disable the "Hey Meta" wake word, which can cause a decent amount of idle drain.</p><p>The biggest issue, though, is simply that my glasses are nearly two years old, and the capacity is fading. And since it's "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/help/ai-glasses/323557833356826/">not possible</a> to replace the battery inside your glasses" because it's soldered in, I'd have to spend $329 on another pair to get better longevity.</p><p>So if I ever wear these for a marathon, I have to accept that I'll only capture content for the first part of the race (unless I go from an average to Olympic-level runner).</p><h2 id="the-next-ray-ban-meta-glasses-need-some-kind-of-battery-revamp-2">The next Ray-Ban Meta glasses need SOME kind of battery revamp</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="LnU9jbJ5AfN5hdoTrsrCSZ" name="Meta-Ray-Ban-half-marathon-test-finish" alt="The author wearing Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses and a finisher medal at the San Jose Half Marathon." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LnU9jbJ5AfN5hdoTrsrCSZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Both my glasses and I were running on empty by this point </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We don't like it when our phone or watch needs more charging after a few years, but we expect it.

And unlike your phone, smart glasses and rings can't be disassembled to add a new battery, not without breaking them.</p><p>Power users will continue to shell out $300 every couple of years for new glasses, but for the rest of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/metas-ray-ban-smart-glasses-are-a-hit-and-its-now-planning-a-massive-production-ramp-up">2 million Meta glasses buyers</a>, they might hold off on buying the next version if the battery fades just as quickly, especially since Meta AI is the big selling point of the commercials <em>and</em> the worst source of power drain.</p><p>Having tested out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ar-running-glasses-arent-ready-yet-but-future-is-almost-here">running AR glasses</a> recently, I'm curious about the rumored Meta "Hypernova" glasses with a holographic display. Then I could see live stats like heart rate and pace without having to look down at my watch. But I wouldn't call this feature "essential" for race day.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="ob7Mi5R5eHLiy35stAmgVQ" name="Ray-Ban-Meta-smart-glasses-skyler-photo-2" alt="A photo of a Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses in the Skyler Shiny Chalky Gray style sitting atop a white-and-green towel next to the glasses charging case." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ob7Mi5R5eHLiy35stAmgVQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2251" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On a more fundamental level, I need the next generation of Ray-Bans to solve or mitigate the battery problem before I make them a regular race companion.</p><p>Ideally, it'd have a repairable design to allow for easily replaceable batteries.

Or there could be a battery saver mode that disables functions you won't need.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It’s the same handy feature that’s been on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> for a while now.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-13s-review">OnePlus 13s</a> launched in India with a new lock screen shortcut that jumps straight into Google Gemini. While the settings label it as "Digital Assistant from Google," <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-13s-gemini-lock-screen-shortcut-3564203/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>’s screenshot gives it away with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>’s unmistakable icon.</p><p>Gemini's lock screen shortcut made waves with the OnePlus 13s launch, but it turns out, it’s not just a 13s thing. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/06/06/oneplus-gemini-lockscreen-shortcut/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, this feature has been around on other OnePlus phones, like the 13, for a while now.</p><h2 id="not-new-just-noticed-2">Not new, just noticed</h2><p>And it’s not even tied to the newest software — the OnePlus 13 it was spotted on was still running a February 1, 2025 security patch, as per the outlet.</p><p>Gemini has pretty much taken over as the go-to AI on Android, and it's everywhere. You can launch it with a long press of the power button or the classic "Hey Google" hotword, among others, making it super easy to tap into what it can do.</p><p>Sure, most modern <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> let you fire up Gemini with a voice command from the lock screen, but that’s just the basics. What makes the dedicated lock screen shortcut special is that it launches the full Gemini app, not just a new query. That means you can jump right back into past chats and pick up where you left off, which voice activation just doesn’t offer.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:396px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:217.17%;"><img id="UTT9SdoiJEeN4qqJRfoq7g" name="OnePlus-13s-Gemini-lockscreen-shortcut" alt="lockscreen shortcut for Gemini on the OnePlus 13s" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UTT9SdoiJEeN4qqJRfoq7g.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="396" height="860" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:396px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:217.17%;"><img id="ednhtXicoENmQUqk3PMk7g" name="OnePlus-13s-Gemini-lockscreen-shortcut" alt="lockscreen shortcut for Gemini on the OnePlus 13s" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ednhtXicoENmQUqk3PMk7g.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="396" height="860" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>It's worth noting that Samsung phones do let you add Gemini as a lockscreen shortcut, but there’s a catch — you usually still have to unlock your phone to actually use it. That means no jumping straight into your chats or full Gemini features without hitting a security screen first. So, the shortcut’s there, but it’s not the seamless, one-tap access you’d hope for.</p><p>The OnePlus 13s is exclusive in India and China, packed with smart features that go toe-to-toe with Samsung’s best. It’s got writing help, real-time call and message translation, and deep Gemini integration baked right into its core apps. But the real flex is a physical AI button and the Gemini lockscreen shortcut.</p><p>Beyond the slick shortcut, the OnePlus 13s is the first to roll out OnePlus’s newest AI features. That includes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-ai-upgrade-for-oneplus-13-and-13s">OnePlus AI Mind</a>, a smart hub that keeps your screenshots, notes, and other bits easy to find later.</p> ]]></dc:content>

In my mind, this would open up a world of possibilities, in addition to being an easy way to access the host of AI features Motorola has packed into its Moto AI suite. However, the implementation leaves a lot to be desired, and frankly, the AI Key is often an afterthought when it easily could have been Motorola’s Action Button.</p><p>Its faults become even more apparent when we live in a world where AI is becoming more prevalent. Motorola’s implementation of it doesn’t really hold a candle to Google or Samsung, but it’s a decent first step. With that said, I think the AI Key is a great idea when done right, and both Google and Samsung would be insane not to consider implementing something like it in future phones.</p><h2 id="moto-ai-limitations-2">Moto AI limitations</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ycdkR38ux8uZtf9BbP6sBW" name="Motorola-Edge-2025-Moto-AI-catch-me-up-01" alt="Moto AI running on a Motorola Edge 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ycdkR38ux8uZtf9BbP6sBW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Motorola is trying to put its own spin on AI, a strategy that includes its own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a> chatbot. You can think of it as a conversational, but somewhat less functional, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> or even Bixby. It can answer questions and respond in a fairly natural way, but it can’t really do much on the phone, which sort of defeats the purpose of having an AI assistant/chatbot. Moto AI is a decent offering, but it still pales in comparison to Google’s AI or Samsung’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>.</p><p>On the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Razr Ultra 2025</a>, you can customize the AI Key to trigger the Moto AI overlay with a long press. Unfortunately, that’s the <em>only </em>option for the long press, which feels like a glaring oversight. You can’t set it to another digital assistant, despite Motorola literally filling the Razr Ultra 2025 with various options. It’s just Moto AI or nothing.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4089px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hgU4hPwJptqeQeMjBMRSMe" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-hands-on-15" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 AI key" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hgU4hPwJptqeQeMjBMRSMe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4089" height="2300" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Okay, fine, so I’ll use Moto AI. No big deal. The problem then is that when I press the AI Key to trigger Moto AI, I have to <em>then </em>press the mic button to <em>talk </em>to Moto AI, which is <em>usually </em>the case. This differs from how Gemini functions when set to trigger using the power button or corner swipe of the display; it automatically starts listening to you. The fact that I have to press another button to talk to Moto AI adds another seemingly unnecessary step, which feels cumbersome.</p><p>This probably has something to do with Moto AI automatically analyzing what’s on your screen when you trigger it, which allows it to provide suggestions on what you should do. However, I don’t see why it can’t do that, and let me talk to it at the same time.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xEfKGfryXxX5DRtQTPWaCW" name="Motorola-Edge-2025-Moto-AI-02" alt="Moto AI running on a Motorola Edge 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xEfKGfryXxX5DRtQTPWaCW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When I activate Gemini with a YouTube video open, for example, it will know that I’m watching a video and populate options such as “Ask about video” or “Talk Live about video,” but I still have the option to begin speaking to it when triggered automatically. This alone makes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a> much more accessible than, and why the “AI Key” should be expanded to just more than Motorola’s AI features.</p><p>On that note, the only other option when customizing the AI Key is a Double tap, which only lets you activate Catch Me Up and Remember This. Nothing else. Which means between a double press and or long press, you have a total of <em>three </em>functions available from the AI Key. It feels like a complete waste of hardware.</p><h2 id="samsung-was-on-the-right-track-2">Samsung was on the right track</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SPiiSqamYigAQx5GdrKWaQ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S8-bixby-key" alt="The Bixby Key and volume buttons on the Galaxy S8" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SPiiSqamYigAQx5GdrKWaQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For a while, Samsung phones used to include an additional Bixby Key, which at the time, felt like the company was trying to force Bixby on us. I remember not being a fan of the move, since I felt Bixby was always playing second fiddle to Google Assistant. However, as AI becomes more prevalent and capable, I wish Samsung hadn’t removed this button from its Galaxy phones and hope the company considers bringing it back.</p><p>The Bixby button may have been introduced as an easy way to access Bixby, but the company has given users at least <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-remap-bixby-button-your-galaxy-phone-launch-any-app">some level of built-in customization</a>. You could set one gesture, either a single tap or double tap, to open an app of your choice or trigger a Routine, while the other option would be used for Bixby.</p><p>What’s more is that users found ways to sideline Bixby completely by using third-party apps like Tasker, which made it possible to trigger Google Assistant instead. This is something I’ve looked into for the Razr Ultra 2025, but so far, I’ve not had much luck.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1582px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:65.23%;"><img id="wQW8YPQXvYPCKmseDAmuiK" name="bixby-remap-2.jpg" alt="Bixby Remap 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wQW8YPQXvYPCKmseDAmuiK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1582" height="1032" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Still, Samsung had the right idea by giving users options with the button while retaining its primary functionality.

One press captures content, a double press begins recording, and a long press opens Essential Space, allowing you to view all your saved content.</p><p>It’s not extremely customizable, but it already makes more sense than Motorola’s implementation, as it provides easy access to content in the hub in addition to having a function that can be activated with a single button press, something Motorola doesn’t offer. Not only that, but users are already finding ways to re-map the button, although hopefully Nothing will allow this sooner or later.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CfVxGY7YHyZyggmEY9z9NB" name="Essential-Space-Organized" alt="The Nothing Phone 3a and 3a Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CfVxGY7YHyZyggmEY9z9NB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>TECNO is another company that has added a One-Tap button to devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-phones/tecno-camon-40-premier-5g-review" target="_blank">Camon 40 Premier 5G</a>, which triggers its Ella AI assistant.

Although I would like to see Samsung implement the AI button again (and it definitely should), this would also be a very helpful addition for Pixel smartphones. Admittedly, the first and biggest reason I would love to see this doesn’t really have to do with AI.</p><p>For some time now, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>, including the Pixel 6 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">newer models</a>, have been defaulting to using the power button to trigger AI assistants. By default, turning off the phone now involves holding down the power button and the volume up button. This is different from how I’ve been conditioned to use the power button for many years, which previously only involved the singular button.</p><p>Fortunately, it’s easy to change to the “normal” way of using the power button on your Pixel or otherwise, but it’s always annoyed me that companies have moved to hijack the power button for purposes other than powering down. After all, there are other gestures I can use to open Gemini, such as swiping from the bottom corner of the display or double-tapping the back of the phone.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2u42Umpxe3p5YtqGi2Y93V" name="Gemini-Live-Plants-3" alt="Using Gemini Live to grow plants and diagnose problems." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2u42Umpxe3p5YtqGi2Y93V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That’s also where having a separate AI button would come in; it would be a perfect way to trigger Gemini on a Pixel.

The Razr Ultra 2025 had a great opportunity with the AI Key, but so far has squandered it with its limited options and somewhat underwhelming Moto AI offering. Google (and by extension, Samsung) should learn from what Motorola and others have done with their buttons, improve upon it, and free the power button from the constraints of AI.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Do you want a phone that costs too much, has a sub-par camera, a tiny battery, and isn't as durable? If so, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-launch">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge</a> is your dream phone.</p><p>This phone is a certifiable 100% bona fide flop. Samsung made too many compromises because someone at the company decided that people wanted a thin phone and were willing to spend a whole lot of money on it. It almost sounds like a script for a comedy.</p><p>Sadly, it's not. It's another example of Samsung testing the waters to see what we can be convinced we want, except this time it failed. But that's okay; Samsung can afford to fail.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s25-edges-early-sales-seem-to-be-as-slim-as-the-phone-new-report-claims">phone apparently isn't selling very well</a>, but that isn't surprising. Samsung going ahead with the idea, even though it's kinda dumb, isn't surprising either. The company does this sort of thing and has been successful in the past. You only <em>really</em> know if an idea is worthwhile <em>after</em> you try it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1024px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.50%;"><img id="gbc7DSQzgnFgEqgN6adt7F" name="galaxy-note-white-ac.jpg" alt="The original Galaxy Note next to the S Pen" src="https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gbc7DSQzgnFgEqgN6adt7F.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1024" height="681" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure><p>Samsung's willingness to do dumb shit brought us the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-review">Galaxy Note</a>. If you like using your Apple Pencil, you need to thank Samsung for reminding us that there are times when your finger just won't cut it. When the first Galaxy Note launched, it was a flop too. T-Mobile actually canceled its version after it was announced and sent to reviewers — I know because they sent me one. Making a big ass phone with a stylus sounded stupid at the time.</p><p>Nobody is saying that today; the Galaxy Note has evolved into the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best phone Samsung</a> has ever made. Fight me. The company is going to do the same with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">book-style foldables</a> and has already generated almost all the interest there is for them, simply by saying "YOLO" and doing it. I love it when Samsung does that, and I hope they never stop. Giving us 10 bad ideas is worth it when that good one hits.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2320px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AoHLkg7rrDhzmY37mzSUud" name="samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-lifestyle-widescreen.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra leaning against a wicker basket, standing upright with its backside shown off" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AoHLkg7rrDhzmY37mzSUud.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2320" height="1305" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Daniel Bader / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That's why the company decided phones needed to be thinner. Somewhere down the line, they will have perfected a way to do it without all the necessary drawbacks of today's tech. My opinion? Forcing a design to be this thin means <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-talked-to-the-brand-thats-revolutionizing-silicon-battery-tech">battery tech</a> has to be improved. A flop of a thin phone is step one to having a battery that's smaller, safer, and lasts longer.</p><p>Having said all of this — and I really do mean it all, I understand why this phone was built — let's take a look at what we actually got: a phone nobody was asking for and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/i-bought-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-but-no-one-else-did">nobody should buy</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2brMZ5ASdSxTc7usxWHJ5Z" name="Galaxy-S25-Edge-Silver-Thin-Profile-Buttons-11" alt="Right side buttons and thin profile on the Galaxy S25 Edge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2brMZ5ASdSxTc7usxWHJ5Z.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's thin. I don't think it's the thinnest phone ever, but you can't deny that it's thinner than anything else you can buy today (excluding foldables). However, it's thin at the expense of other features that make a phone good.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-slim-if-its-real-who-asked-for-this">I predicted this last January</a> when I said making a phone very thin using today's tech would mean you need to sacrifice battery life. I was slightly off; you also sacrificed camera quality, performance, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s25-edge-durability-test-gauntlet-results">durability</a>. But mostly the battery.</p><p>Right now, the batteries are brand new, and you hear people say they almost last all day or will last all day if you manage it correctly. In 90 days, it will be "I can get by topping it off at dinner time," and in 180 days, people will need to charge it even more often. That's how batteries work; the more you use them, the less you <em>can</em> use them.</p><p>As someone who used a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/pixel-phones-pick-new-features-start-june">Pixel 4</a> for a year, let me tell you that it only gets worse from here. A smartphone is useless without any gas in the tank.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="XxyfiGCNgNsQ2HTyRyJeVK" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review-12" alt="Battery activity results on Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XxyfiGCNgNsQ2HTyRyJeVK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Surprisingly, that's not enough to kill a phone at launch. People will want it because it's thin and can get by using a cable and a charger. What killed the S25 Edge was its $1,000+ asking price.</p><p>Samsung can pretend that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-top-exec-addresses-galaxy-s25-edge-battery-woes">they didn't compromise</a> to make a phone this thin, but even the people saying that know the truth. This is a prototype of the next big idea, and the only way for it to get better is to build it and work through it all. If it sticks around, we might love what it turns into.</p> ]]></dc:content>

In reality, the company has been trying to figure out mobile devices since 2009, before pivoting to apps that only offered specific editing features.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GWzSUiSHX2bjyLWih3XjkC" name="Photoshop-Express-Galaxy-Tab" alt="Photo editing software on an iPad Pro M4 (left) and Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Plus (right)." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GWzSUiSHX2bjyLWih3XjkC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Using Photoshop and Lightroom has become an essential part of my workflow, so needless to say, I was ecstatic to see it arrive on the Play Store.

The move came alongside a big new feature: the ability to find people, not just your devices. Right on cue, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-find-hub-app-redesign-rolling-out">the app got a fresh update too</a>—now called Find Hub—with new Device and People tabs to make that rebrand crystal clear.</p><p>Google is betting big on UWB (Ultra-wideband) to make Find Hub actually useful when you need it most.

Google is also gearing up to add satellite connectivity. That means even when you’re way off the grid with no cell signal, you can still stay connected with friends and family.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Marvel's Deadpool VR was announced at Summer Games Fest today, but I got to try an early demo in late May at Meta's offices in California.</p><p>Marvel's Deadpool VR stars Emmy-winning Neil Patrick Harris as the titular antihero and was developed by Twisted Pixel. Acquired by Meta in 2021, Twisted Pixel last made beat-em-up VR game <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/path-of-the-warrior/2032870023439846">Path of the Warrior</a> in 2019. Deadpool has evidently been years in the making.</p><p>The game felt like an immediate and obvious foil to 2024's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/batman-arkham-shadow-review">Batman: Arkham Shadow VR</a>, made by another Meta-acquired developer, Camouflaj. Both have professional voice actors, long story-driven campaigns, and demanding next-gen graphics. And yet they couldn't be more different in combat, movement, and tone.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="hjHzpAoQXNBfcakQUMcgHH" name="Marvels-Deadpool-VR-screenshot-slash-effect" alt="A Deadpool VR screenshot showing a bloody sword attack and comic-book script "SLASHIMI!" above a dying bad guy." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hjHzpAoQXNBfcakQUMcgHH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Twisted Pixel / Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Deadpool snarks his way around a SHIELD helicarrier, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mojoworld">Mojoworld</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Spirit_of_Xandar">Spirit of Xandar</a>, and other Marvel Comics multiverse locales that feel like polar opposites to the dark, grounded Gotham. And the violent gun and sword battles felt more chaotic and less structured than Batman's mix of timed punches and gadget combos.</p><p>It also sounds <em>very</em> different from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_(video_game)">Activision's Deadpool</a> from 2013, which heavily focused on the X-Men comics and characters like Wolverine and Rogue. Deadpool VR's cast stars more niche characters like Mojo, Lady Deathstrike, and Flag-Smasher, and the narrative doesn't seem quite as dependent on 4th-wall breaks as the old game.</p><p>Having spent nearly an hour bumbling through one of the early levels, I can share my thoughts on the best and worst parts of Marvel's Deadpool VR during my hands-on, as well as all the game info that Twisted Pixel shared with us during the Q&A afterwards.</p><h2 id="gory-creative-combat-and-silly-one-liners-2">Gory, creative combat and silly one-liners</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4Jof1MtYccs" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>My demo started fairly early on in Marvel's Deadpool VR storyline, with Deadpool's head being studied by an evil scientist on a stolen helicarrier before you control his headless body to kill the scientist and free yourself.</p><p>Then you run through the ship, guided by a hapless SHIELD rookie by comms as you learn the controls and combat. By default, you can grab a sword over your shoulder, gun from your hip, or grenade from your wrist, and more weapons will be introduced as the game continues like a bow and arrow.</p><p>When you take damage, parts of Deadpool will fall off, and you'll have to adjust your gameplay strategy accordingly (until they grow back).</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="AAM7zMAMQcvn2bZatsTG6H" name="Marvels-Deadpool-VR-screenshot-cutscene" alt="A screenshot of Deadpool's headless body about to slam a bloodied scientist's head against a desk, with cartoonish text "Was that a tooth?!" next to him." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AAM7zMAMQcvn2bZatsTG6H.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Twisted Pixel / Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I had the least trouble mastering gunplay, aiming your default pistol or picking up weapons along the way and blasting waves of foes. You can aim at specific body parts to blast them off or use a grapple weapon to fling or disarm foes.</p><p>But gun combat is fairly common in a lot of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">Meta Quest games</a>, and the developers want you to get more creative. For that, the focal point is the close-quarters combat. With the sword, you can dismember body parts, then pick them up and throw them at other enemies. You can counter attacks from shielded foes, or fling your sword at a far-away enemy before grabbing a new one.</p><p>The goal, Twisted Pixel said, is to "Say yes to the player" and "reward creativity," and that there was a "bunch of stuff that you guys didn't try" that we'd discover naturally across the campaign, but is available from the start.</p><p>The devs also promised things like a "boomerang sword" and "exploding bullets," and there will be custom moves you can use against specific enemies or with certain weapons.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="24v6m78PT2Yw9gRYmkGKyG" name="Marvels-Deadpool-VR-screenshot-violent-sword-combat" alt="A Deadpool VR screenshot showing an impaled head on a held sword with the headless soldier in the near distance." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/24v6m78PT2Yw9gRYmkGKyG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Twisted Pixel / Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, sword combat is also where I had the most trouble. I would swipe my sword at a foe and, for whatever reason, it would simply dance around their body with no effect while they hit or shot me. I especially struggled with shielded foes meant for close-quarters combat, who would wail on me while I swiped helplessly back.</p><p>I assumed it was a skill issue on my end, and I needed to master the timing of sword strikes better. But other journalists I spoke to after the demo agreed that sword attacks felt somewhat weightless.</p><p>The Twisted Pixel devs responded by saying they didn't want the reverse side of VR melee combat, where you simply hold your sword toward an enemy, "waggle it," and have it "chop people up instantly." They say they're "still working on" a "combination of animation, haptic feedback, and sound" to make sword impacts feel satisfying.</p><p>So I'm curious how it'll feel in the final version, with more practice. I'd say swordplay is the most important part of a Deadpool VR game, so I'm hoping they get it right.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="mAKH2oeLeJ6drmf5mRaPWH" name="Marvels-Deadpool-VR-screenshot-sword-combat" alt="A Deadpool VR screenshot showing Deadpool holding a sword and throwing knife as two ninja-like foes charge towards the player." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mAKH2oeLeJ6drmf5mRaPWH.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Twisted Pixel / Meta)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="yaZqsMWvJDow3EtTVRrtRH" name="Marvels-Deadpool-VR-screenshot-bow-and-arrow-combat" alt="A Deadpool VR screenshot showing the player holding a bow and arrow, pointing at a charging ninja enemy." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yaZqsMWvJDow3EtTVRrtRH.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Twisted Pixel / Meta)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="PN63uPW5fkRMo5rohWpCNH" name="Marvels-Deadpool-VR-screenshot-gun-combat" alt="A Deadpool VR screenshot showing Deadpool dual-wielding pistols pointed at a cyborg enemy leaping down towards the player." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PN63uPW5fkRMo5rohWpCNH.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Twisted Pixel / Meta)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="2Ai9zRfMFdprhZd7mii6GH" name="Marvels-Deadpool-VR-screenshot-sniper-combat" alt="A Deadpool VR screenshot showing the player pointing a laser-pointed sniper rifle at a foe across the room." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2Ai9zRfMFdprhZd7mii6GH.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Twisted Pixel / Meta)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Outside of combat, Deadpool runs and parkours around the stage, with double-jumping available for more flexible movement.

They said their version of Deadpool "pulls more strongly from the comics" than from the movie Deadpool.

If you know what specs you're looking for and in what sort of price range, one look at this chart will tell you which cable is right for you.</p><p>If you're still clueless, don't worry my friend. I've got you! Ask yourself a few questions and the answer will become clear.</p><p>First off, what phone do you use? If you're an Apple user with an iPhone older than the 15 series, obviously you'll need a lightning connector. Anker and Raycon are both great options. The Raycon cable is superior from every perspective, except for the cost. It's got swappable connectors so you can use it with all your other gadgets too. If you don't want to spend $35 on a cable, Anker will do just fine.</p><p>For my Android users, pick the Baseus 100W cable and don't look back. The 6ft variant is long enough for most use cases and the nylon-braided structure makes it highly durable. And get this, the 6ft version is only $10! That's the best deal you'll ever find on such a speedy USB-C cable.</p><p>Now, if you've got a wired pair of headphones, earphones, or in-ear monitors, you'll probably want to check out the budget-friendly JSAUX USB-C Headphone Charger too. This DAC adds a handy 3.5mm headphone jack to your smartphone, something all the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> lack these days. Since there's USB-C passthrough charging, you don't even have to worry about blocking off your Type-C port when using the adapter. For $13, that's as good as it gets.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Will it get cheaper, and is it worth it to buy the 2024 device when the next-gen flip phone drops? </p><p>After all, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 debuted last summer with a steep $1,099.99 price tag, so it&apos;s no wonder people have been looking for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/deals">deals</a>. At this point we can only speculate, but I&apos;ve been working launches like this long enough that I have a pretty good idea of what you can expect. Let&apos;s dive in. </p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-we-know"><span>What we know</span></h3><p>If the latest leaks and rumors are correct, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> will be revealed during a live Samsung Unpacked event in early July. The new clamshell foldable will likely be announced alongside the premium Galaxy Z Fold 7 and two Samsung smartwatches, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8 and Watch 8 Classic</a>. </p><p>The Z Flip 7 is expected to come loaded with a powerful Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, an updated design, and a larger cover display than ever before (think more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025">Motorola Razr</a>-esque). The flip phone is also certain to feature all of the latest Galaxy AI software features and seven years of guaranteed OS and security upgrades. As for the cameras, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/early-alleged-galaxy-z-flip-7-camera-specs-detailed">one rumor</a> has suggested that the Z Flip 7 will retain its predecessor&apos;s camera tech, which would be quite controversial among Samsung users if the leak proves accurate. </p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="muLAZxgnWdWVKXRtcCm2bH" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-Flex-Mode-Panel.jpg" alt="Galaxy Z Flip 6 Flex Mode Panel with Instagram running" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/muLAZxgnWdWVKXRtcCm2bH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Still, the biggest question mark comes down to the phone&apos;s price. After several generations without a price increase, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 was revealed last year with a starting price of $1,099.99, which was $100 more than its predecessor.</p><p>Will Samsung increase the price of its clamshell phone again in 2025? It&apos;s hard to say, but considering that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Motorola Razr Ultra (2025)</a> — the Flip&apos;s biggest competitor — was recently unveiled with a $1,300 price tag, I wouldn&apos;t put it past them. There&apos;s also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-might-hold-back-the-budget-galaxy-z-flip-7-model-until-late-2025">some speculation</a> that the Z Flip 7 will be announced alongside a more-affordable "Fan Edition" version of the phone, but details on that rumor are scarce.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-will-the-z-flip-6-get-cheaper"><span>Will the Z Flip 6 get cheaper?</span></h3><p>So now for the big question: will last year&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> finally get cheaper now that the Z Flip 7 is on the way? The answer may not be as simple as you&apos;d like. </p><p>The good news is that the top-rated flip phone is already being discounted fairly often by retailers and wireless carriers alike. As of writing, for example, the unlocked Z Flip 6 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D195JKYD"><strong>over $200 off at Amazon,</strong></a> while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.att.com/buy/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip6.html"><strong>AT&T is dropping up to $1,000 off</strong></a> the phone when you trade in and add a line. </p><p>Now, you might see those deals and be tempted to wait until the Z Flip 7 arrives to see if the price drops even further, but I&apos;d be careful. Retailers will often discount a phone <em>before</em> its next generation arrives to make room for new stock. This means that the Galaxy Z Flip 6 might be sold out on most sites by the time you&apos;re ready to buy, which gives you less leverage as a consumer.</p><p>But there&apos;s a bright side. Amazon&apos;s Prime Day sale is likely to be announced in the coming weeks, and if past year&apos;s are any indication, the event will fall right around the same time as the Galaxy Z Flip 7 announcement. <strong>This upcoming sale might be the best opportunity to get the Galaxy Z Flip 6 at a serious discount</strong>, as retailers all across the web will be taking on Amazon with competitive offers of their own. This puts you in the driver&apos;s seat, and it will likely result in some of the best Galaxy Z Flip 6 deals we&apos;ve ever seen. </p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="8a540a43-dcb6-468b-b250-8c0176ee90d9">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JrEgbbZSCjj6z4VY5Zx5XP.jpg' alt="Render of the blue Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Still a great flip phone</strong></em></p><p>Although it's about to hit last-gen status, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 remains a great <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phone</a> with a sleek, super-pocketable design, loads of AI features, and years of guaranteed software support.

This year, Spotify said it paid out over $10 billion to the music industry globally in 2024, marking the largest single-year payout by any retailer in music history.</p><p>The report also adds that nearly 1,500 artists generated over $1 million in royalties from Spotify alone in 2024. And 80% of these artists didn't have their song reach the Spotify Global Daily Top 50 chart. Meaning, without having a mainstream hit, they were still able to generate revenue.</p><p>The surprising part, however, is that Canadian artists seem to be thriving globally, and in 2024, Canadian music artists earned CAD<strong> </strong>$460 million in royalties on Spotify, which is almost double the earnings they made since 2019. Spotify says this was possible because Canadian-grown global stars like The Weeknd, Justin Bieber, Céline Dion, and more have built a strong foundation for budding artists.</p><p>"That’s not just streams; that’s sustainable careers being built in studios, basements, and tour vans from Vancouver to Halifax," the streaming giant added.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3imaMspAbZLSG2pt5DtEZT" name="The-Weeknd-on-Spotify" alt="The Weeknd on Spotify" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3imaMspAbZLSG2pt5DtEZT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Spotify)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Speaking of where these royalties were earned, Spotify says that 94% of the money earned by Canadian artists through Spotify came from outside Canada.</p><p>This means Canada has become one of the world's top music exporters, and that Canadian music is not only being streamed locally but also in "cities like Jakarta, Osaka, Melbourne, London, São Paulo, Berlin, Mexico City, and Seoul."</p><p>Since Canada is a bilingual country, its French music also saw a 15% growth in global Spotify royalties just in the past year.</p><p>For instance, "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://open.spotify.com/track/44A0o4jA8F2ZF03Zacwlwx">Québécois artist Patrick Watson’s 'Je te laisserai des mots'</a> was the most popular francophone track on Spotify globally in 2024, and the first French-language track to pass 1 billion streams," the report stated.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4083px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="xiSaKKC5vQVxF8rM7NZufU" name="Spotify-Jam" alt="Spotify Jam" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xiSaKKC5vQVxF8rM7NZufU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4083" height="2297" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Furthermore, Spotify says that Canadian women have also been at the front and center of music creation, and since 2020, their global streams on Spotify have also doubled. And as of 2024, "40% of Canadian artists earning over CAD $1 million on Spotify were women or in groups with both male and female members."</p><p>“This is what Canada sounds like—diverse, digital, and not just thriving domestically, but leading on the world stage. The data is clear in underscoring the vital role that export plays in sustaining the overall health of Canada’s music industry,” said Xenia Manning, director of Global Music Policy, Spotify.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The tipster alleges that Huawei is working on a sequel to its Mate XT tri-fold, which could be called the "Mate XT 2," if we're being incremental. There's supposedly more going on with this next phone by way of hardware upgrades.</p><p>DCS claims the tri-fold could sport a brand new, upgraded SoC (processor), possibly built off an "N-1" generation chip. In response to a comment, DCS said the chip could be Huawei's Kirin 9020. Additionally, the phone's imaging power could go up a level, though it's unclear just how far Huawei is willing to push its cameras.</p><p>Considering how early these rumors are, there's nothing concrete to go on (aside from the chip's apparent name drop). More than that, the tipster alleges Huawei's "Mate XT 2" could launch sooner than we think.</p><p>The phone could be eyeing a "second half of the year" timeframe, which kind of sounds like what the Chinese OEM did in 2024.</p><h2 id="the-tri-fold-surprise-that-is-the-mate-xt-2">The Tri-Fold Surprise that is the Mate XT</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2342px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="LRU4rJP9uDdMqnnXCJm4tj" name="huawei-mate-xt-promo-3.jpg" alt="Huawei Mate XT promo image" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LRU4rJP9uDdMqnnXCJm4tj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2342" height="1317" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Huawei)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Huawei <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-rollable-phone-pursuit-alleged-report">came out of nowhere</a> with its tri-fold, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-ultimate-design-launch">the Mate XT</a>, in September last year. Without talking about its eye-watering price tag (¥19,999/~$2,808), the device features a 10.2-inch display when fully unfolded. The phone quickly turns from something handheld to a phone-tablet. The publication reiterates the device's use of the Kirin 9010 processor, so it would make sense that Huawei might upgrade that key specification.</p><p>Additionally, the Mate XT debuted with a triple camera array, consisting of a 50MP lens with f/1.4 aperture, a 12MP ultrawide-angle lens, and a 12MP periscope lens.</p><p>With rumors suggesting we could see an imaging upgrade, maybe Huawei's looking at the ultrawide and periscope lenses. Of course, it would be nice if that primary lens jumped to 100MP or more, but we'll just have to wait and see.</p><p>Aside from Huawei, we're also expecting Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-teases-a-wild-new-foldable-phone-dropping-in-late-2025">to step into the tri-fold world</a> for the first time.

The email states this feature is designed to "streamline routine tasks" and provide "personalized" updates straight from Gemini to the user. In a subsequent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/scheduled-actions-gemini-app/">blog post</a>, Google states users will be able to ask Gemini to perform "a task at a specific time, or transform a prompt you're already using into a recurring action."</p><p>It seems Gemini will be able to cover a wide range of potential actions from users. For example, users can have a summary based on their emails in the morning from Gemini. Additionally, Gemini can collect and display sports scores for you, detail important calendar event roundups, and more.</p><p>What's more, Google says Gemini will work fine with "one-off" actions, too.</p><p>Your scheduled actions in Gemini will be housed on a new page in the app's settings. From there, users can change scheduled times or perhaps the action itself, as well as delete it entirely if needed.

This theory is also consistent with past years of the event, as the Galaxy Z Fold 6 was initially announced on July 10th, 2024 with a July 24th release date. </p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 is expected to be announced alongside the clamshell-style <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a>, plus we should be getting a release date for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8</a> and Watch 8 Classic. There's also a chance that Samsung will surprise-drop a first look at its triple-folding <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-tri-fold-name-change-hardware-specs-rumored">Galaxy G Fold</a>, but info on that phone is relatively scarce at this time. </p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="f7mGPGbcitjef6WE8oaYJj" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-12.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 review cover screen in-hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f7mGPGbcitjef6WE8oaYJj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For specs, the premium foldable is likely to feature the same Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset that powers the Galaxy S25 series, plus a new-and-improved "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-may-finally-bring-this-much-needed-upgrade-to-the-galaxy-z-fold-7">creaseless foldable panel</a>", two vibrant AMOLED displays, and the thinnest design of any Z Fold phone to date.</p><p>It's also quite possible that the Z Fold 7 will be more expensive than its predecessor, and considering that the 2024 model already started at a steep $1,799.99, we better hope that the preorder deals are especially good this year.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-will-the-z-fold-6-get-cheaper"><span>Will the Z Fold 6 get cheaper?</span></h3><p>So given the information detailed above, should you expect the Galaxy Z Fold 6 to get cheaper when the Z Fold 7 arrives? Well, it's complicated. </p><p>For starters, it's worth mentioning that the Galaxy Z Fold 6 is already being discounted quite heavily across most retailers. At the time of writing, for instance, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Handsfree-Interpreter-Manufacturer/dp/B0D18QJCPR"><strong>Amazon is slashing over 20% off</strong></a> the unlocked foldable, bringing the price down to $1,499.99. These deals are presumably meant to clear stock ahead of the Z Fold 7's release, and with the swift arrival of Amazon Prime Day (also slated for early July), it's unlikely that there will be many Z Fold 6 units <em>left</em> when the new foldable phone finally arrives. </p><p>In other words, I'd suggest that the best time to buy a phone is <em>right before</em> its next generation arrives, rather than right after. Sure, the Z Fold 6 might get a permanent price drop when its successor hits store shelves, but it's just as likely to be largely out of stock by that time (unless you're cool with a refurbished version). <strong>In conclusion, if you prefer unlocked </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/deals"><strong>phone deals</strong></a><strong>, Amazon Prime Day 2025 is going to be the best time to buy the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6. </strong></p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="cf31ab8c-d35f-433a-931f-77066ba9372b">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:98.61%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Qk9BrbQMCLYk6ofsRaMfP.jpg' alt="Galaxy Z Fold 6 render in white"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Premium foldable, premium price</strong></em></p><p>Although it's soon to be supplanted by the Z Fold 7, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 remains one of the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">best foldable phones</a> around, boasting a powerful Snapdragon chipset, two glorious 120Hz AMOLED displays, and excellent battery life.

According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/06/05/google-search-live-testing/">9to5Google</a>, which spotted the test, this experiment places AI Mode in the center with a familiar Gemini Live vibe. When activated in the main Google app, via a wavelength icon under the search bar, Search Live will welcome users with a descriptive splash page. The company states, "With Live, you can have a real-time voice conversation with AI Mode to find exactly what you're looking for."</p><p>After unmuting, users will be free to voice whatever their query is, similar to speaking in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/gemini-live-pixel-9-pro-grocery-list">Gemini Live</a> (even the UI is kind of the same).</p><p>Search Live will process your query and is said to deliver a "scrollable carousel" of results. This is likely similar to every other Google Search experience where, when receiving your answers, the most prominent (or best) result is first, with varying degrees of relevance beneath that. Users can, of course, interact with these results, tapping them for more information.</p><p>The publication states users can ask follow-up questions if they're still unsure; however, there's a chance <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-tests-experimental-ai-mode">AI Mode</a> will ask you to "clarify."</p><h2 id="google-s-highlight-ai-mode-2">Google's Highlight: AI Mode</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:267px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.72%;"><img id="B5tjnLpQPBAH93yu9HGWmQ" name="google-ai-mode-search-live-splash-page" alt="AI Mode's "Search Live" test displays a splash page explaining users can have a conversation with the feature for real-time results." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B5tjnLpQPBAH93yu9HGWmQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="267" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:276px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:217.39%;"><img id="NVogVeKWQfCuyUKExMv3mQ" name="google-ai-mode-search-live-results-example" alt="AI Mode's "Search Live" test will display a "scrollable carousel" of results for users to look through." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NVogVeKWQfCuyUKExMv3mQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="276" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>There are some little details, such as the "Transcript" button's existence isn't what it seems. The post states tapping this just lets you text chat with AI Mode, not receive written notes for reflection later. Moreover, this update is seemingly rolling out for Search Labs users in the Google app on Android and iOS. Users are also able to continue their conversations with Search Live even when the app is in the background.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-i-o-2025-the-biggest-announcements-from-ai-to-android-xr">I/O 2025</a> was jam-packed with information regarding AI Mode, Gemini, M3 Expressive for Android, and more. We're here to talk about AI Mode, and that new feature stood out, as Google announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/ai-mode-levels-up-with-new-ai-features-stealing-google-searchs-spotlight">integration with Project Astra</a>. In short, this upgrade will soon bring conversational capabilities to AI Mode when using your phone's camera. The feature will be able to see what you see, taking in everything it needs to before delivering your results.</p><p>Additionally, AI Mode is set to gain <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://deepmind.google/technologies/project-mariner/">Project Mariner's capabilities</a>, too. What this will do is let the feature "understand" all elements of a website. This will take away some manual tasks from the user, like filling your online cart with items to purchase. Instead, you can ask AI Mode to scour the web, find some gameday tickets for you, and it'll do just that.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Additionally, Samsung will offer buyers up to <strong>$500 in instant trade-in credit on the phone</strong>, along with three free months of Samsung Care Plus, and access to early upgrades through the New Galaxy Club program.</p><p>It's worth noting that the Samsung Galaxy S25 is our pick for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones#section-best-small-phone">best small Android phone</a> on the market. With a really vivid, 6.2-inch AMOLED display and excellent photo and video capabilities, the S25 has a lot to offer to the modern smartphone user. Samsung also guarantees seven Android OS updates, making it more future-proof than some competitors. Similar deals are also available for the S25 Ultra and S25 Edge for a limited time, if you're interested in upgrading from the base model.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="f05f3bdd-02da-4691-b8e3-db34ae703de3" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy S25 (256GB): $859.99" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy S25 (256GB): $859.99" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-s25/buy/galaxy-s25-256gb-unlocked-sm-s931udbexaa/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:554px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="p7pcw6vmJ48V2Sjh6xgGrL" name="Samsung Galaxy S25 in Pinkgold official render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p7pcw6vmJ48V2Sjh6xgGrL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="554" height="554" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy S25 (256GB): </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-s25/buy/galaxy-s25-256gb-unlocked-sm-s931udbexaa/" target="_blank" data-dimension112="f05f3bdd-02da-4691-b8e3-db34ae703de3" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy S25 (256GB): $859.99" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy S25 (256GB): $859.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$859.99</del> <strong>From $299.99 with trade-in during the Discover Samsung event</strong></a></p><p>The 2025 Discover Samsung Sale comes with a ton of nice deals, including free storage boosts for the Galaxy S25, S25 Ultra, and S25 Edge.

In almost every case, the answer isn't what people want to hear, and it looks like that will be the case with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>, which is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-is-getting-qi2-1">rumored not to include built-in MagSafe charging</a>.</p><p>I've said it before, and I'll say it again: stop expecting it. Not that those magnetic Qi2 chargers aren't handy; I certainly see the appeal to people who can't or won't set their phone down long enough to charge, and millions of dollars have been spent to let you know that you should want it. When a phone launches and you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-buying-time-with-galaxy-s25-qi2-implementation">need to buy a case</a> to use the magnetic accessories, you're disappointed.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:960px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:60.10%;"><img id="gUnm8fpf7MSkase53rkqEh" name="Samsung-galaxy-z-fold-ultra" alt="Samsung teases a Z Fold Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gUnm8fpf7MSkase53rkqEh.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="960" height="577" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Nothing anyone can say is going to change that. But you can find some solace in knowing that you have a new phone that supports <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20231115984149/en/Qi-v2.0-Standard-for-Wireless-Charging-Is-Now-Ready-to-Provide-Enhanced-User-Experience" target="_blank">the technical specifications</a> that are newer, safer, and better, even if you had to buy an ugly case to get the magnetic parts. And you should be thankful the "right" players <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-will-come-to-more-android-phones-in-2025-with-help-from-samsung-and-google">pushed for the latest Qi charging specs to be split off this way</a>, because engineers who design phones surely hate magnets.</p><p>That's half said in jest, but it's partially true: unless you specifically designed a phone with magnets in a particular place, they are going to interfere with the way it's supposed to work. Magnets can mess up electronics, especially a device as complicated as a phone.</p><h2 id="but-apple-can-do-it-2">"But Apple can do it!"</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="psYSd2jGSX3bC8R3dvGC9L" name="Moonside-MagLight-lifestyle-5.jpg" alt="Moonside MagLight and companion accessories" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/psYSd2jGSX3bC8R3dvGC9L.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Yup. And Apple "invented" the idea of using a trio of magnets to hold a wireless charger in the right spot. Then it built a phone around it. It was such a novel idea that Apple wanted to share it and gave it away, becoming part of the Qi2 standards. Thanks, Apple.</p><p>But Samsung is not Apple. Samsung has been working on phone design years ahead of the actual release date, and doesn't want to go back to the drawing board, so it can be more like an iPhone. We probably shouldn't want them to do it, but that means we have to buy a case, and we grumble about it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yEhpLmBzkxgQH49kzCAoNW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-review-08" alt="Galaxy S25 Plus in hand with a case on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yEhpLmBzkxgQH49kzCAoNW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I think the current system works perfectly. If you want to attach your charger, Pop Socket, or whatever else you want with magnets, you can. In the meantime, Samsung doesn't have to scrap a lot of work, and we may get the next big thing we never knew we wanted or needed from them.</p><p>Perhaps it should include a Qi2 Ready case inside the box with the phone instead of charging money for it, though. Just a thought, Samsung.</p><p>One day, we will see a new Samsung Galaxy with magnets built in, just like we'll see a Pixel with them, unless some better way to charge comes along. Maybe even next year. Until then, know that companies aren't doing it to piss you off; they are doing it because it's the best way right now.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p> ]]></dc:content>

However, it's time to include OnePlus in the mix thanks to the OnePlus Pad 3.</p><p>There are trade-offs to consider, no matter what flagship tablet you're looking at. Samsung's Galaxy Tab S10 lineup is comprised of just two models, and despite dropping Qualcomm, both are still more expensive than the Pad 3. On the other hand, Samsung offers the most software features of the bunch, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> and DeX Mode.</p><p>In terms of pure design, you can't deny that the iPad Pro looks the part. Unfortunately, cracks begin to form when it comes to the software, not because of the app ecosystem, but due to iPadOS itself. Not to mention that this is the most expensive tablet of the bunch for the base model.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-pad-3-should-you-buy-it"><span>OnePlus Pad 3: Should you buy it?</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="kRz7rTtnrWGzv5hZDCgsMN" name="Back of OnePlus Pad 3" alt="Back of OnePlus Pad 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kRz7rTtnrWGzv5hZDCgsMN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p><ul><li>You want the best flagship Android tablet.</li><li>You suffer from PWM and need a tablet that isn't OLED.</li><li>You want a device that has a few extra features, but doesn't try to do too much.</li></ul><p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if...</strong></p><ul><li>You prefer an OLED display.</li><li>You need a tablet with LTE or 5G connectivity.</li><li>You want a tablet that has a dedicated Desktop Mode and don't want to wait.</li></ul><p>The OnePlus Pad 3 really gets a lot of things right, as it's both performant and has a premium design.

Now that you do, you can take full advantage of it. But there are a few things to note as well.</p><p><strong>You won't lose your playlist</strong></p><p>You don’t need to worry that transferring a playlist from one service to YouTube Music will remove it from that host service. The playlist will still exist there. (Though you will lose access everywhere it exists if you no longer subscribe to a paid service).</p><p><strong>Changes don't sync</strong></p><p>Note that if you make changes to the version of the playlist in YouTube Music, these modifications won’t sync with the other one. So, if you add or remove a song or two, for example, you’ll have to go back to Spotify, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/apple-music-youtube-music-playlist-transfer">Apple Music</a>, or your other service as well to mirror that change manually. If you want to get around that, always update the playlist in the main service then transfer it over again whenever you’ve made big changes so the two playlists are in sync.</p><p><strong>Easily transfer an entire Apple Music library</strong></p><p>A useful tip: if transferring from Apple Music, you can use the handy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/c69125f5226e448dabf4f816c3264388">Add Entire playlist to library shortcut</a> first to instantly create a playlist with all your songs. From there, you can then transfer your entire library to YouTube Music in one fell swoop as a new, massive “playlist”.</p><p><strong>Some songs might not match</strong></p><p>If there are songs that aren’t available on YouTube Music within the playlists you try to transfer, you won’t be able to transfer them. You should receive a notification, however, advising that the song could not be matched. Playlists with podcasts are not supported and cannot be imported to, or exported from, YouTube Music.</p><p><strong>The process can take long for larger playlists</strong></p><p>Since the process can anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours depending on how many playlists you want to transfer and how many songs, plan to do this when you’re at home and can keep your device plugged in and fully charged.</p><h2 id="transfer-away-2">Transfer away!</h2><p>The feature is one of the reasons YouTube Music is among <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">the best streaming music apps</a>. It’s a great way to keep all your favorite playlists from different services in one place, accessing them when and how you want. You can integrate YouTube Music into your existing set-up without having to go through the gruelling task of recreating playlists you already worked so hard to build.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="e30545e5-5a0a-4dee-a048-ec3dfed5e140">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FJQLviZPvGH4qrdXhNCMxG.jpg' alt="YouTube Premium logo"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">YouTube Premium</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Upgrade your experience</strong></em></p><p>YouTube Music is free to access, but there are limitations and ads.

It’s a simple move that could seriously level up scrolling through media in busy group chats.</p><p>At present, you can react or reply to photos and videos in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-first-things-to-do">Google Messages</a>, but every time you do that with another media, it kicks you back to the main chat. This feels a bit annoying when you're trying to go through a bunch of media at once.</p><p>This new way of viewing media is about to address this shortcoming. Instead of leaving one photo and hunting through the chat for the next, you’ll just swipe left or right to flip through recent or older pictures. Plus, a handy bar at the bottom lets you drop comments or reactions without missing a beat.</p><p>Android Authority managed to get this feature up and running and even shared a demo to show how it works in real life.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uboynFivFTc" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><h2 id="lost-media-no-more-digging-2">Lost media? No more digging</h2><p>While swiping through media is a bit more helpful, it won’t cut it for digging up older stuff. That’s why Google is adding a dedicated media overview you can find in the chat details. Tap the new “Images” section, and you’ll get a neat timeline of every photo and video shared, kind of like what you see in some of our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-text-messaging-apps">favorite messaging apps</a>, such as WhatsApp.</p><p>These tweaks might seem small to most, but if you’re always swapping pics and videos, they’ll make a big difference. And Google has been on this grind for a while—earlier this year, it was already testing threaded replies for media, so it’s clear Google wants to make Messages way better for handling visuals.</p><p>It’s still in the works, but it could drop for everyone in the next few months. Either way, it’s shaping up to be a solid upgrade.</p> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Chargeasap is a new accessory manufacturer that's doing good things with charging tech. I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/power-charging/chargeasap-flash-pro-ultra-25000mah-275w-power-bank-that-does-it-all">tested the Flash Pro Ultra</a> a few weeks ago, and the 25,000mAh power bank held its own against Anker and UGREEN's offerings. The brand also sent over its GaN charger, and I've been using it for the better part of a month now.</p><p>The Zeus ticks all the right boxes: it has four charging ports in total, going up to 140W individually and delivering a total power budget of 280W. That's considerably more than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/ugreen-nexode-pro-gan-chargers-launch">UGREEN Nexode Pro</a> I use while traveling, which hits 160W in total. Another feature I like is that the Zeus has a built-in panel that shows real-time charging details, and this is quite handy — I normally rely on USB-C cables with integrated power meters to see these details.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5121px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.34%;"><img id="TKxccBWr5E8LeTmBYxrNKf" name="Chargeasap Zeus" alt="Chargeasap Zeus 280W GaN charger review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TKxccBWr5E8LeTmBYxrNKf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5121" height="2885" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The downside is the cost; the Zeus <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://chargeasap.com/products/270w-zeus-charger">retails for $219 in the U.S.</a>, and that's more than twice the cost of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Charger-Compact-MacBook-Pixelbook/dp/B0CCVPB4PC">160W Nexode Pro</a>. Clearly, Chargeasap is positioning the additional features as a key selling point of the charger, and it has other niceties — you get a set of plugs in the box that allows the charger to double a global travel plug that can be used anywhere, and that brings much-needed versatility.</p><h2 id="the-zeus-has-unmatched-versatility-2">The Zeus has unmatched versatility</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="ZYcwZw6YyMBktHNQCJopYf" name="Chargeasap Zeus" alt="Chargeasap Zeus 280W GaN charger review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZYcwZw6YyMBktHNQCJopYf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Basically, this is an all-in-one GaN charger that works anywhere in the world, and with the higher power budget, you'll only need the Zeus to charge all of your devices on the go. On that note, the charger is smaller and lighter than most options in this category; a decent achievement considering you're not missing out on any features.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5075px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="weaVod2egrMRdLtAUNGRNf" name="Chargeasap Zeus" alt="Chargeasap Zeus 280W GaN charger review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/weaVod2egrMRdLtAUNGRNf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5075" height="2859" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The rectangular design is easily portable, and I like that the Zeus comes in a white color variant; far too many chargers are just sold in a grey or black color, and the white model stands out. Coming in at 320g, it doesn't weigh too much either, and you get a pouch that holds the travel plugs and the charger with relative ease.</p><h2 id="it-s-designed-to-charge-all-your-devices-at-once-2">It's designed to charge all your devices at once</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5134px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="3W7N9jPsr7smaBdhznFRNf" name="Chargeasap Zeus" alt="Chargeasap Zeus 280W GaN charger review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3W7N9jPsr7smaBdhznFRNf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5134" height="2892" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Coming to connectivity, the Zeus has a single USB-A port that goes up to 65W, and three USB-C ports. The main and secondary USB-C connectors hit 140W over the USB PD 3.1 protocol, and the other port maxes out at 100W. What I like the most is the integrated OLED panel; it shows real-time charging info, and it makes all the difference if you're charging several devices at once — like I do all the time.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="5bAvaF5FRph2dxGCUvWYUf" name="Chargeasap Zeus" alt="Chargeasap Zeus 280W GaN charger review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5bAvaF5FRph2dxGCUvWYUf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The charger has foldable blade plugs as standard, and you can slot in U.K., Australia, and an angled two pin connector if you're traveling. Build quality is great, and I didn't see any issues with the Zeus in the month I used it. It tends to get a little hot when all ports are in use, but that is the case with all GaN chargers, and it doesn't overheat.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="8wTyyDKHsRQ6J2ffvpTXUf" name="Chargeasap Zeus" alt="Chargeasap Zeus 280W GaN charger review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8wTyyDKHsRQ6J2ffvpTXUf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The USB-C port handles PPS up to 65W, making it a good choice if you've got a Samsung device. Interestingly, the USB-A port has the VOOC charging protocol, but it's limited to 22.5W, and I was able to charge the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/oppo-find-x8-ultra-review">Find X8 Ultra</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">Find N5</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-13s-review">OnePlus 13s</a> with relative ease. Of course, you can also use the regular USB-C PD connectivity with these devices now, but if you've got an older BBK phone, the Zeus is definitely handy.</p><h2 id="all-the-power-you-need-anywhere-you-want-it-2">All the power you need — anywhere you want it</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4936px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="3eW9TLroiJtXNxPUtiwn8f" name="Chargeasap Zeus" alt="Chargeasap Zeus 280W GaN charger review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3eW9TLroiJtXNxPUtiwn8f.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4936" height="2780" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another differentiator is that the Zeus is able to handle charging two 140W devices at the same time. That is a big deal, and it allows the charger to go up to 280W in total. This is the rundown of the power budget you get with the Zeus:</p><ul><li><strong>USB-C1/C2 out (140W max):</strong> 5V/3A (15W), 9V/3A (27W), 12V/3A (36W), 15V/3A (45W), 20V/5A (100W), 28V/5A (140W)</li><li><strong>USB-C3 out (100W max): </strong>5V/3A (15W), 9V/3A (27W), 12V/3A (36W), 15V/3A (45W), 20V/5A (100W)</li><li><strong>USB-A out (65W max):</strong> 5V/3A (15W), 4.5V/5A (22.5W), 5V/4.5A (22.5W), 9V/3A (27W), 12V/3A (36W), 15V/3A (45W), 20V/3.25A (65W)</li><li><strong>USB-C1 + C2 out (280W max):</strong> 140W + 140W</li><li><strong>USB-C1/C2 + USB-C3 (240W max): </strong>140W + 100W</li><li><strong>USB-C1 + C2 + C3 (270W max): </strong>140W + 65W + 65W</li><li><strong>USB-C1/C2 + USB-A (205W max): </strong>140W + 65W</li><li><strong>USB-C1 + C2 + USB-A (270W max):</strong> 140W + 65W + 65W</li><li><strong>USB-C1 + C2 + C3 + USB-A (255W max):</strong> 140W + 100W + 15W</li></ul><p>The charging potential is a key advantage, and I was able to use the Zeus with my Honor MagicBook Pro 16, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x200-ultra-review">Vivo X200 Ultra</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-ipad-pro-m4-13-inch-long-term-review">iPad Pro M4</a>, and over a dozen accessories without any issues. The charger delivered consistent power, and I didn't see any issues whatsoever in this regard.</p><p>To sum up, the extensive feature-set combined with 280W power budget means the Zeus is now my go-to choice as a travel GaN charger. It has all the accessories I need while traveling, and having an OLED panel lets me see how long it takes to charge all connected devices. It is on the costlier side, but you also get double the charging potential of most GaN chargers available today, and that's an achievement in and of itself.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="242b11d8-98d6-4d4e-b2be-cf3de8fa92c8">            <a href="https://chargeasap.com/products/270w-zeus-charger" data-model-name="Chargeasap Zeus 280W GaN Charger"><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:102.95%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dNGmon3jovSdW5wpZ9f6YX.jpg' alt="Chargeasap Zeus"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Chargeasap Zeus 280W GaN Charger</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>With all the power you need and a portable design that works globally, the Zeus is one of the best GaN chargers you can buy today. </p></p>                </div>                <div class="pro-con"></div>            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

But the clock is ticking on Samsung's "free" AI features. And at some point, Galaxy Watch owners may have to ask themselves whether they're willing to pay for the best version of Samsung Health.</p><p>It started last year when Samsung revealed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> and wearable insights like Energy Score and AI-based Wellness Tips for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Watch 7</a>. It promised at the time that its AI tricks "will be provided for free until the end of 2025 on supported Samsung Galaxy devices."</p><p>At the January Unpacked, Samsung revealed a much longer list of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/im-more-excited-about-galaxy-unpacked-samsung-health-features-than-galaxy-s25">AI-based health features</a> coming this summer: Vascular Load tracking to determine daily "strain on your heart," a "personal health coach" for LLM-based "insights" for your health questions, an "antioxidant index" with "tailored meal plans and recipes," and mood check-ins.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:64.97%;"><img id="RRQnekYhcCfDoP7UzSmjtC" name="Galaxy-Unpacked-Vascular-Load-example" alt="The Vascular load (Labs) submenu in Samsung Health that shows your heart's activity level from day to day, as well as a summary of the data: "Steady: Your vascular load is consistent.

And we can expect even more, based on this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/one-ui-8-feature-runners-virtual-coach-guidance-rumor">recent leak</a> about a Samsung "Running Coach" that'll have you run for 12 minutes to judge your fitness baseline and then build a "personalized training plan" for you.</p><p>Additionally, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/my-8-favorite-things-about-the-one-ui-8-beta" target="_blank">One UI 8 beta</a> introduced food log reminders and a "Together" feature that challenges your friends to match your weekly running distance.</p><p>Until we hear otherwise, all of this should be free for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8</a> owners. I've been waiting for Samsung to pair its dual-band GPS accuracy with better running guidance and an equivalent to the training load info that Garmin, Apple, and Fitbit offer. That's why the Running Coach-Vascular Load combo sounds tantalizing.</p><p>My worry, though, is that this is all bait on the hook for an eventual Samsung subscription. I could easily see Samsung building up its stockpile of health tools before making a Fitbit Premium or Google One AI equivalent very soon.</p><h2 id="waiting-for-the-other-shoe-to-drop-2">Waiting for the other shoe to drop</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="aicnph6WTXLfmFefVdmFdh" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-and-Watch-6-Classic" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic (left) sitting atop the Galaxy Watch Ultra (right)." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aicnph6WTXLfmFefVdmFdh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In an ideal world, we'd trust that Samsung simply wants to improve its app to make it more competitive against Apple Health, as a boon for people who pay for its products.

Garmin, in particular, held back on releasing new features so that it could shove them all into its subscription and mitigate profit losses from tariffs.</p><p>I'd guess Samsung is taking the reverse approach: It wants to hook us with free Galaxy AI perks, then throw them behind a paywall and deal with the blowback then. After all, it did <em>warn</em> us it would charge for AI eventually.</p><p>Perhaps I'm worrying over nothing, and we'll still receive free auto-generated nutrition plans, running plans, and the health coach's services even after 2025. However, Samsung will examine its health and AI competitors, which charge $10–20 per month, and see that its customers have few alternatives left to turn to.</p><p>If Samsung starts to paywall even some of these tools in 2026, it'll make the Samsung Health experience <em>very</em> different, closer to the free, watered-down version of Fitbit.</p><h2 id="would-you-pay-for-a-samsung-health-subscription-2">Would you pay for a Samsung Health subscription?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CNFEsF8R8aG7BJUiZccGnK" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-ui-8-beta-1-running-together" alt="The Together feature in the Samsung Health app on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CNFEsF8R8aG7BJUiZccGnK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Maybe this speculation is premature. But when I saw that rumor about the Samsung Health Running Coach, exactly what I'd been waiting for, I had to remind myself to look this gift horse in the mouth before letting myself geek out. It's AI-generated, like the other new features.</p><p>I could see Samsung offering one overall Galaxy AI plan for all your devices, similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One</a> AI Pro plan. Or else it could keep the phone AI subscription separate from the Samsung Health Coach subscription.</p><p>So let's assume that Samsung Health goes from a free app to a paywalled one sometime next year. Are you excited enough by AI coaching, nutrition, and health data that you'd pay for it after the free trial ended? Would you continue using Samsung Health but ignore the AI tricks entirely? Or would a paywall push you to look elsewhere for a different fitness app?</p> ]]></dc:content>

Because of the way Android is developed and distributed, you've always been able to build it yourself, to your own specifications.</p><p>Let's be honest, though; it was fun for some people, but traditionally it's been a pain in the ass that few people are able to do. Troubleshooting cryptic commands to build some software overnight that might not even work is something most people don't feel like even trying. I don't blame anyone; it can be a headache, no matter how fun you might find it.</p><p>The good news is that you don't have to do it yourself any longer, and companies like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-murena-one-is-pure-android-not-pure-google">Murena</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/eos-review-privacy-focused-android-without-google">e-foundation</a> are doing all the hard work for you. And you know what? They make a really damn good product, one I think everyone needs to check out for themselves, and it's called /e/OS.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yB5aSK3ZTrZcPkks9nxJVL" name="Murena-Fairphone-4.jpg" alt="Murena Fairphone 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yB5aSK3ZTrZcPkks9nxJVL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Murena)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I don't hate Google. The company does a lot of things I don't like, but it also does a lot of things I do like. I choose to embrace Android for a reason: I think it's the best commercially available platform and offers the most choice, so the things you buy do what you want them to do.</p><p>When you take the best parts of Android and work to turn it into software built for users instead of financial gain, the results are amazing. With the release of /e/OS 3, it's reached the point where it's a good choice for everyone.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pVoaO6sFXZs" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>You have access to every feature you can think of that doesn't require a giant tech company to act as an overseer. Secure cloud backup? It's there. An intuitive interface that can be customized to work best for you? That's there, too.</p><p>So are all the apps you love because it's Android; you can even access a network tool to help you find your phone when you lose it, without Google or Apple shepherding how you're doing it. While the software has been more than usable for a while, the latest version takes the final step. It's as good or better than Google's Android or iOS.</p><p>There are two reasons why now is the perfect time to check out what /e/OS has to offer. First, and most important to a lot of us, is that you probably won't have to spend any money.</p><p>The software is designed to run really well on modest hardware (remember when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-go">Android was that way</a>?), so it will likely work with your last phone if you didn't trade it in for something new and shiny. It will even work well on phones as old as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-pixel-november-update-squashes-the-first-round-of-android-15-bugs">first Google Pixel</a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-5-specs">OnePlus 5</a>. You can find a list of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://doc.e.foundation/devices" target="_blank">221 supported models here</a>, but if you do have a few dollars to spend, you can also buy it preloaded on phones from Murena and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/fairphone-5-ifixit-perfect-repairability-score">Fairphone</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1851px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="GUCSaY8eKAjJMzgxZsQBT" name="e-os-3-smartphone" alt="/e/OS 3 on a smartphone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GUCSaY8eKAjJMzgxZsQBT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1851" height="1041" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Murena)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You can also trust the software, much more than you can trust anything else. I'm not saying you shouldn't trust Google, Apple, or Samsung, but /e/OS is 100% open-source, and an entire development community pores through the code to make sure it does exactly what it is advertised to do. Nothing more, nothing less.</p><p>A good portion of Android is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/aosp" target="_blank">still that way</a>, but much of what you'll find in a new phone comes from Google or the company that made it, and they aren't sharing how it works. To know exactly what a Google Pixel can do, you have to either be part of the development team or trust the development team.</p><p>To know exactly what an /e/OS phone can do, you simply need to read what is made freely available to everyone. No marketing team or sales division is acting as a middleman between you and what you want to know.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1678px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:57.63%;"><img id="4nWrBwRHNS8YAn5VeyQRkA" name="AOSP.jpg" alt="AOSP" src="https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4nWrBwRHNS8YAn5VeyQRkA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1678" height="967" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Trying it is easy, too. You will need a computer with sufficient space to download the installer and files themselves; the process is straightforward. Make sure your phone is up to date, works, and has a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-cables-android-auto">USB cable</a> plugged in. The simple installer walks you through everything else.</p><p>But maybe you're not ready to leave Google or Apple behind, and that's fine. Both companies offer great reasons to buy their products and are a good choice for everyone on most fronts.</p><p>If you're interested in privacy, having a little more control over your digital life, or even curious about what else is out there, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://e.foundation/e-os/" target="_blank">head over to the e-foundation</a> and have a look.

The video gives viewers a peek into his memorable moments, as he shares stories looking back at some of his photos.</p><p>A short snippet of the video has been doing the rounds on TikTok, where Chan shows off his Pandas to the world. While these Pandas are definitely adorable, what caught our attention was the phone he was using. It looks like one of the latest foldable devices, due to the obviously visible hinge in the center.</p><p>When we looked a little closer, we saw that the phone is small enough to be held in one hand, and sleek too, when unfolded.</p>                    <blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@people/video/7511799977451080990" data-video-id="7511799977451080990" style="max-width: 605px; min-width: 325px;">                        <section>                            <a target="_blank" title="@people" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@people">@people</a>                            <p></p><a target="_blank" title="♬ Lofi - Domknowz" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/Lofi-6799585653702019073">♬ Lofi - Domknowz</a></section>                    </blockquote>                <p>The device's form factor has led us to believe that it could either be the Huawei Mate X6 or the Honor Magic V3. Upon comparing screenshots from the video clip with his Honor Magic V3, Android Central's Nick Sutrich noted that they appeared to be identical phones. He specifically pointed out the battery icon, hinge piece, and corners of the device as being a match to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review">Honor Magic V3</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, others on the team speculate that Jackie Chan actually uses the Huawei Mate X6. It's a bummer that we don't get to see the rear panel of the device; it would've made it easier to guess. As for why we think it's mostly a Huawei Mate X6, it's because Chan has a history of owning Huawei phones.</p><p>The actor has been spotted using Huawei phones since 2016, and in 2019, when a fan gave Jackie a Huawei phone at an event, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://cnalifestyle.channelnewsasia.com/8days/jackie-chan-seen-buying-huawei-phone-once-said-all-chinese-people-should-use-chinese-products-429166">he reportedly pulled out three Huawei phones</a> and said, “I use Huawei and have several of them. Chinese people should use domestic products.

Chan was seen browsing through different models and inquiring about them with Huawei staff.</p><p>According to someone present at the store, the actor wanted to buy the newly launched Mate 60  but was told it was out of stock and could only be pre-ordered. Later, he ended up getting the Huawei Mate X3. Considering Jackie Chan's fascination with the brand, our speculation is leaning towards the fact that the actor owns the new Huawei Mate X6, which was launched in November 2024.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Fortunately, most mobile service providers offer their customers some degree of international coverage, you just need to choose the data plan that works for you (and your budget). </p><p>Up until recently, only the most expensive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/best-unlimited-data-plans">unlimited plans</a> gave users international coverage, but that's swiftly changing as the wireless landscape gets more competitive. The Big Three (Verizon, T-Mobile, and AT&T) already include roaming in Mexico and Canada, but if you want faster speeds or data outside of North America, you'll need to do a little research.

You start by choosing a plan at a base price, and then you mix and match perks based on your needs any given month, each of which cost $10 per month. This can be super convenient if you have a trip coming up, because you can easily plan ahead by adding perks like TravelPass and hotspot data without any real commitment beyond the month in question. </p><p>The Unlimited Ultimate plan also gives you unlimited talk, text, and 15GB of high-speed data in over 200 countries worldwide. Once the 15GB runs out, you'll still get unlimited data at 1.5 Mbps, which is more than sufficient for most simple tasks. With a starting price of $90/month, the Unlimited Ultimate plan can be pretty expensive if you're just signing up for one line, although the price drops considerably when you bring the family along.</p><p>Alternatively, you could also sign up for a more affordable Verizon plan and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.verizon.com/plans/international/international-travel/travel-pass/"><strong>simply use TravelPass</strong></a>. This feature costs $12/day and gives you unlimited talk, text, and data in over 200 countries. Once you add TravelPass to your Verizon account, you'll only be charged for the days you actually use the service, which can come in handy if you generally rely on Wi-Fi calling when overseas. </p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-budget"><span>Best budget</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:801px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:52.06%;"><img id="iW3ezBdsDXPBMzSRVTddME" name="visible-smile-169.JPG" alt="Visible smile logo on phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iW3ezBdsDXPBMzSRVTddME.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="801" height="417" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Visible)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="2-visible-plus-pro-2"><span class="title__text"><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/visible-review">2.

You also get 4K UHD streaming quality, unlimited mobile hotspot data, and a five-year price guarantee so you won't have to worry about your phone bill suddenly getting more expensive. </p><p>Travelers will enjoy free talk, text, and 2GB of data in Mexico, Canada, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands, after which speeds will begin to slow. Subscribers to the Plus Pro plan will also get two days of Global Pass every month, which gives you unlimited talk, text, and 2GB of high-speed data in over 140 countries worldwide. That may not seem very generous, but you can also save up to 12 of these unused Global Pass days to use when traveling, which is pretty good for only $45 per month. Alternatively, you can pay for the annual version of the Visible Plus Pro plan and receive 24 Global Pass days to use at your convenience. Global Pass can also be purchased a la carte for $10 per day. </p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-premium"><span>Best premium</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1990px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="BvTcxLK4iRKgLdiYgUZd9T" name="T-Mobile-Store.jpeg" alt="T-Mobile store sign" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BvTcxLK4iRKgLdiYgUZd9T.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1990" height="1119" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="3-t-mobile-experience-beyond-2"><span class="title__text">3.

There are also a few surprising perks that I haven't seen anywhere else, such as free in-flight Wi-Fi and discounted hotels and rental cars if you book through T-Mobile Travel. International calling will still cost $0.25 per minute, but it's easy enough to just use Wi-Fi calling when you're overseas. </p><p>The problem is that the Experience Beyond plan is quite expensive, costing over $100 per month for a single line.

Use a 5G-compatible <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> and you'll even get 5G service in over 90 of the aforementioned countries. </p><p>Google Fi's Unlimited Premium plan starts at $65 per month for a single line, but you'll save some cash by adding up to four lines on your account. All things said and done, it's a pretty reasonable price for what you get, as long as you don't rack up costs overseas with those $0.20/minute phone calls.</p><ul><li><a href="#main"><strong>Back to the top^</strong></a></li></ul><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-choose"><span>How to choose</span></h3><p>There are plenty of great <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cell-phone-plans">phone plans</a> for folks who regularly travel abroad, but that doesn't mean that there's a one-size-fits-all solution. Before you settle on one plan, it's important to consider your needs as a device user, your budget, and of course, your destination. </p><p>For starters, it's best to look at your current wireless plan and see what it offers. Do you only need talk and text on your travels? If so, how much? Do you need data for navigation or surfing the web? Asking yourself these questions is a great place to start when choosing a plan for your journey. And who knows, maybe your carrier already has a great option that'll work for you. </p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vBJsLpu2HdkkTFV4avmuSi" name="visible-sim-card-passport-hero.jpeg" alt="Visible SIM card sitting on top of US passport" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vBJsLpu2HdkkTFV4avmuSi.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you can't get coverage from within your destination of choice, you could also look into your carrier's Wi-Fi calling policy. Wi-Fi is readily available in most countries across the globe, and if you don't frequently send texts or use data while traveling, it could be sufficient for your needs abroad.</p><p>Another piece of advice I'd offer is to watch out for <em>how </em>carriers describe their international coverage. For example, there's a big difference between "free calls <em><strong>in </strong></em>XX countries" and "free calls <em><strong>to </strong></em>XX countries". Both are useful perks, but they mean very different things. One will let you make calls from inside another country, while the latter example means that you can only call other countries from <em>inside the United States. </em>It may seem like an obvious distinction, but it's easy to get mixed up if you aren't careful. </p><p>Lastly, it's important to remember that many carriers offer international coverage a la carte, so you may not need to switch to an entirely new plan to use your provider's network overseas. Verizon, for instance, offers TravelPass in over 210 countries worldwide. It costs just $12 per day and can easily be activated on any of Verizon's data plans.</p> ]]></dc:content>

There's an entire category of headphones and earbuds you may not be as familiar with: sleep headphones. These products can simultaneously block out unwanted sounds and play your favorite music, podcasts, or white noise to ensure you get a perfect night sleep, whether you're in your bed or on a flight overseas.</p><p>If you've ever tried wearing some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">best wireless earbuds</a> to bed, you probably know that regular earbuds aren't that comfortable for sleep. That's why <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/quieton-31-sleep-earbuds-review">sleep earbuds</a>, sleep headbands, and sleep over-ears exist — they are designed specifically for comfort in all sleeping positions. Most sleep earbuds are characterized by a low-profile design that rests within your ear canal, while open earbuds, sleep headbands, and sleep over-ears avoid it altogether.</p><p>There are a bunch of different reasons for why you might want to wear a pair of earbuds or headphones to sleep. Maybe you sleep with someone who snores or live next to a noisy train station. While traveling, you might want to block out airplane turbulence or car noise to catch some sleep. Whatever your needs are, these best sleep headphones and earbuds will help you get the perfect night's sleep.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_hero" data-id="5916d48b-4a68-46fc-b4b0-10c19d48d9d5">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9YcaTcDkUmB766JceRMYbk.jpg' alt="A product render of the Anker Soundcore Sleep A20 against a white background."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Anker Soundcore Sleep A20</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Best overall</strong></em></p><p>Anker's Soundcore Sleep A20 hit all the right notes, providing comfort and battery life at an affordable price point. The earbuds' low profile mean people can wear them to sleep regardless of their sleeping position, including side sleepers. In sleep mode, the Sleep A20 can last for 14 hours straight, for a total of 80 hours with the charging case. You also get a digital sound library of sleep sounds and Bluetooth 5.3 support for playing anything you'd like. </p></p>                </div>                <div class="pro-con"></div>            </div>        </div>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_hero" data-id="a9a91468-b2aa-411b-a4e8-82929eca031e">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AAnMyexpeTfzZok2vd3cJh.jpg' alt="The Anker Soundcore Sleep A10 product render against a white background."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Anker Soundcore Sleep A10</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Best budget pick</strong></em></p><p>If you like the Soundcore Sleep A20 but wish they were a bit cheaper, the Sleep A10 are your perfect sleepbuds. They're slim and designed for side sleepers just like the newer model, and are cheaper. With a more modest 10-hour battery life in sleep mode, these will still get you through the night. Passive noise canceling and low-frequency audio production help make this a great budget choice for a good night's sleep. </p></p>                </div>                <div class="pro-con"></div>            </div>        </div>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_hero" data-id="5c157a94-f31e-4386-aa63-251797532c7b">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/szqDkb46mgzcshziHwHpU9.jpg' alt="The Ozlo Sleepbuds product render against a white background."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Ozlo Sleepbuds</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Best premium pick</strong></em></p><p>For those who want the absolute best sleep earbuds, there are the Ozlo Sleepbuds.

The closest thing to a one-size-fits-all solution are the Anker Soundcore Sleep A20, which are affordable and comfortable sleepbuds aimed to fit in a variety of sleeping styles. They have neat tech inside, including an MEMS electrical sensor to track your sleep and create a quality score. With these earbuds, you may be able to ditch your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">smartwatch</a> or fitness band.</p><p>The Sleep A20 earbuds come with a pre-loaded sleep sound library, but also work as standard Bluetooth earbuds. In sleep mode, you can get up to 14 hours of battery life on a single charge — that's more than enough for even the longest snooze sessions. At $160, the Anker Soundcore Sleep A20 strike a nice balance between premium features and affordability.</p><p>Those on a budget might prefer the Anker Soundcore Sleep A10, the older model that's available for a $30 discount, sometimes more. It still offers solid battery life and features aimed to help you get a good night's sleep.</p><p>On the other end of the spectrum, there are the Ozlo Sleepbuds, which cost a lump sum of $350. For that, you get a premium set of earbuds and a companion charging case with a bunch of sensors and features. The earbuds include a sleep-detecting accelerometer, and the case offers a tap detection, ambient noise detection, an ambient temperature sensor, and an ambient light sensor. All these factors can be used to determine your quality of sleep, and a built-in alarm helps you wake up.</p><p>Plus, you get Bluetooth Low Energy support for ultra-low power draw and Android features like Auracast. Though, for many, the price is too high with limited feature advantages compared to the Sleep A20.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rPyAhMqzK2ox3a94gBShWZ" name="nothing-ear-open-cu-in-hand-cu.jpg" alt="Nothing Ear (open)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rPyAhMqzK2ox3a94gBShWZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Having anything in your ear can be uncomfortable for some sleepers. If that sounds like you, we have some outside-the-box picks for favorable sleeping environments. For starters, you can consider the SleepPhones — a headband that covers your eyes and sports inbuilt speakers for media playback outside your ear canal.</p><p>There are also the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/nothing-ear-open-review">Nothing Ear Open</a>, which are open-ear buds that remain outside your ear canal. They're bulkier than the other in-ear options, but can be used in a variety of situations, like fitness and everyday wear. Side sleepers should pass on the Nothing Ear Open, but they're an excellent option for people who sleep on their back or stomach. Side sleepers can also opt to only wear one earbuds for a more relaxing experience.</p><p>A pair of over-ear headphones can come in handy for sleeping in upright positions, making them an amazing choice for airplane trips, train rides, and long road trips. For that, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sonos-ace-review">Sonos Ace</a> are impossible to beat. They feature comfortable memory foam and vegan leather materials for comfortability and aren't too heavy. Plus, you get active noise-canceling — most in-ear sleepbuds only use passive sound isolation.</p><p>With USB-C and a 30-hour battery life with ANC active, the Sonos Ace can be your travel companion every step of the way. They're a great pair of everyday headphones, too.</p><p>When choosing a pair of sleep headphones, you should consider whether you're willing to spend money on a dedicated care of night earbuds. If you aren't, the Nothing Ear Open or Sonos Ace may be a more value-oriented option, as they can be used all day <em>and</em> all night. Regardless, you can't go wrong with any of the headphones or earbuds on this list for sleep.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Google says these auxiliary systems will include users with a video production tool, an external camera, or a document camera. What's bringing this capability is a new option within your <strong>Settings > General </strong>tab.</p><p>Users will find a new "Share content from camera" toggle. After enabling, users should find their external cameras within the Presentation icon's "Camera" option in a meeting.</p><p>Google threw in something extra, stating its support for external cameras will bring 1080p and 30fps streaming quality.</p><p>While sharing external content becomes easier, Google Meet's update adds extra improvements for device-based presentations. The post states screen shares will have upgraded video quality, which improves the viewing experience when the presenter is scrolling or showing a video. Starting a screen share becomes faster, alongside a small UI update to make starting presentations and controlling them easier.</p><p>Google ends by stating a small QoL update lets an older presentation resume if a second presenter ends their sharing session.</p><h2 id="google-meet-s-in-the-spotlight-2">Google Meet's in the Spotlight</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1047px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:57.31%;"><img id="exPxz2Jc6wy6MWCyfnrs7A" name="google-meet-share-content-from-camera-example" alt="Google Meet's latest update brings a "share content from camera" option for external camera use." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/exPxz2Jc6wy6MWCyfnrs7A.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1047" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1036px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:57.92%;"><img id="swrbG79YWSHtD5LgQ9kZ8A" name="google-meet-external-camera-selection-ui" alt="Google's external camera update for Meet lets users select which camera to use when beginning a presentation." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/swrbG79YWSHtD5LgQ9kZ8A.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1036" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>It seems this update isn't coming to regular end-users, as Google's patch notes only highlight Workspace users. Those with Business, Enterprise, Frontline (Standard), Enterprise Essentials and Enterprise Essentials Plus, Education Plus, and individual Workspace consumers will see these Meet updates.</p><p>Those on Google's rapid-release domain will see the update beginning this week (June 4), while those on the Scheduled-release domain will begin on June 11. The update should wrap up in ~15 days for both domains.</p><p>Google's been improving the Meet experience since earlier this year when an update for Android brought a redesign and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-mixed-things-up-with-its-meet-redesign">a spotlight on emoji reactions</a>. The company said that update from February is designed to "organize features more intuitively." Moreover, emoji reactions took a front row seat during conference calls, so users can quickly react without playing with menus.</p><p>For computers, Google Meet started rolling out its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-meet-color-sampling-tile-redesign-rolls-out">classy new tile design</a> for callers in April. Meet now utilizes its "color-sampling" capabilities to grab colors from your profile picture and apply them to your card's background. It's also worth mentioning that Google Meet will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-meet-to-sunset-legacy-duo-features-in-september">soon sunset all legacy Duo features</a> in September.

However, to combat this, Samsung developed software to "detect" signs of sleep apnea via the Galaxy Watch, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-expands-global-availability-of-sleep-apnea-feature-on-galaxy-watch-series">that's now rolling out to more people</a> globally. In a blog post, the Korean OEM states its sleep apnea detection feature on the Galaxy Watch is arriving via the Samsung Health Monitor app in 34 European markets.</p><p>The company warns that "availability may vary depending on country-specific registration in some European markets."</p><p>Samsung states this is possible due to the feature's recent reception of CE marking in the European Economic Area. This marking states the Galaxy Watch's sleep apnea feature has met the European Union's health, safety, and environmental standards for consumers.</p><p>More than that, Samsung is bringing sleep apnea detection to users in Australia and Singapore. The company states it also had to walk through the appropriate governmental processes in order to bring the feature here, as well. The feature has obtained clearance via Singapore’s Health Sciences Authority and the Therapeutic Goods Administration in Australia.</p><p>Consumers in these regions with a Galaxy Watch 4 series device <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-hands-on">or newer</a> (with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> or higher) will have access to Sleep Apnea.</p><h2 id="improving-sleep-2">Improving Sleep</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:907px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.15%;"><img id="cFLw2jEqX3jvMiHKepaLyX" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-sleep-apnea-global-expansion" alt="Samsung's Sleep Apnea feature present on a Galaxy Watch." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cFLw2jEqX3jvMiHKepaLyX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="907" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung's been on a journey to improve users' sleep health via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-could-detect-blood-pressure-sleep-apnea-like-galaxy-watch">this Sleep Apnea feature since 2023</a>. It was then that the Korean OEM announced its sleep health feature had successfully passed through South Korea's Ministry of Food and Drug Safety. This meant the feature could launch on supported Galaxy Watches in the country as soon as "early 2024."</p><p>The Sleep Apnea feature leverages the Galaxy Watch's BioActive Sensor to alert users to potential signs of the medical condition. While Samsung says it is useful, it's not recommended for those who've already been diagnosed with sleep apnea.</p><p>Luckily for U.S. folks, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-sleep-apnea-detection-us-fda-approval">the FDA passed Samsung's feature</a> through, meaning it could arrive on Galaxy Watches in the States. That announcement stated the feature could be utilized by consumers aged 22 or older; however, there's a requirement for the watch. If you're interested, you must wear your Galaxy Watch to bed as often as possible. Samsung says the device needs to track your sleep for more than four hours within a ten-day timespan.</p><ul><li><strong>Smartwatch deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/searchpage.jsp?st=smartwatch&_dyncharset=UTF-8&_dynSessConf=&id=pcat17071&type=page&sc=Global&cp=1&nrp=&sp=&qp=&list=n&af=true&iht=y&usc=All+Categories&ks=960&keys=keys"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/search?q=smartwatch"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=smartwatch&crid=19YAPQ38561AK&sprefix=smartwatch%2Caps%2C138&ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_1_10"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/watches-audio-accessories-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/search/smartwatch"><u><strong>Dell</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Currently, Call Notes will automatically play a spoken message explaining to the person on the other end of the call that it is being recording. Soon, that might change, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-phone-call-notes-toggle-teardown-3564540/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> reports users could be able to turn off this spoken message in a future update.</p><p>The team at Android Authority tore down <strong>version 178.0.765584175-publicbeta-pixel2024</strong> of the Phone by Google app and found references to a toggle that would effectively disable the spoken Call Notes message. It's called <strong>Play audio tone instead of disclaimer</strong>, and the feature appears to work exactly like you'd expect based on its name.</p><p>Within the latest Phone by Google version APK, there are two new audio files that presumably relate to this feature. Android Authority surmises that they may be different tones for the beginning and ending of a recording session.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HV4oFxou98WazcAsXE34KC" name="google-pixel-9-call-notes-transcript.jpg" alt="Call Notes summary and transcript on the Google Pixel 9 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HV4oFxou98WazcAsXE34KC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A chime or tone would make it harder for the average person to discern whether their call is being recorded with Call Notes. Unless you're a Pixel user with access to the feature, it's unlikely that you'd know these new Call Notes sounds are really disclaimers that a conversation is being recorded.</p><p>Of course, there is a clear benefit to people recording who want to be subtle, as this feature could remove the awkwardness that the current level of transparency can create.</p><p>At the moment, it's unclear when, or if, this feature will arrive in the stable Phone by Google app. The fact that it is visible in the Phone by Google app beta signals that this is something Google is toying with, but it's not a confirmation that a change will certainly be made.

Now Garmin has thrown its hat in the ring with a U.S. patent for tracking your glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels.</p><p>You can use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ppubs.uspto.gov/pubwebapp/static/pages/ppubsbasic.html">U.S. patent search</a> to find patent number "20250134464," which outlines how Garmin could use its watches' photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals — commonly used for heart rate and blood oxygen — to determine a "user's glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level."</p><p>As the patent explains, HbA1c checks the volume percentage of your blood's hemoglobin proteins that are "glycated," or bound or coated with glucose. Because glucose stays attached to red blood cells for their four-month lifespan, HbA1c "provides a long-term indication of the average blood glucose level...and is typically not impacted substantially by a single meal or activity."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2550px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="b4AGgPiVyDirFpJekzHyRR" name="Garmin-blood-glucose-patent-figure-4a" alt="A Garmin patent figure showing an "electronic fitness device" placing pressure on "human tissue," with various components calculating the level of pressure and sending it to the processor along with PPG data." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b4AGgPiVyDirFpJekzHyRR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2550" height="1434" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p>"Determining and monitoring HbA1c levels can help with the management of glucose and insulin," the patent continues, as diabetics want to maintain their blood levels below 7%. And lowering it below 5% "is believed to improve and maintain an individual's overall health."</p><p>Since, currently, people must draw blood to test levels, it's easy for people to be unaware of their growing HbA1c levels, or to avoid frequent testing because of the discomfort. That's why this "would be of great benefit to users of a wrist-worn device," to have this data available painlessly and continuously, the patent suggests.</p><p>This patented tool wouldn't replace the spot-check blood tests diabetics use on a daily basis. For that, Garmin partnered with Dexcom so you can continuously see your mg/dl of glucose from an attached Dexcom patch on your Garmin watch.</p><p>Instead, this seems more like a preventative tool that would warn prediabetics of bad glucose trends and encourage better fitness and nutritional habits to bring down your HbA1c gradually over weeks and months.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="QEBmLRKeY5w3sQJqFyXZQR" name="Garmin-blood-glucose-patent-figure-2b" alt="A Garmin patent figure showing the bottom sensors of a Garmin watch, with dotted lines pointing to a zoomed-in look at the sensors with various labeled components." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QEBmLRKeY5w3sQJqFyXZQR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What's the hold-up on seeing this feature in Garmin watches now? The patent warns that "conventional electronic fitness devices" will struggle to provide accurate data in this area. Pressure from a tight band can compress your blood vessels, and the size of your ligaments and bones will also skew the results.</p><p>So the watch's processor will need to determine a "pressure metric value" to compensate for these effects and provide accurate results. Garmin's patent outlines how it will attempt to pull this off, but it'll need FDA levels of accuracy before we'd ever see this HbA1c tracking feature in a consumer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a>.</p><p>Samsung execs have openly shared plans to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-exec-health-forum-glucose-monitoring-highlighted">put blood glucose tracking in a Galaxy Watch</a>, while Apple is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/31/apple-watch-glucose-monitoring-feature/">"many years away" from glucose tracking</a> despite several patents on the subject.

In short, this test puts Chrome on trial, seeing how well its "critical components" perform within the Blink rendering engine. In the recent 139 dev build test, which Chrome conducted on an Apple MacBook Pro M4 with iOS 15, the browser achieved a score of 52.35, its highest yet.</p><p>While this beats out how Chrome <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.chromium.org/search/label/the%20fast%20and%20the%20curious">scored last year</a> on the Speedometer 3 test, Google says this is all thanks to several additional optimizations.</p><p>It's not a huge number; however, Google states its optimizations have resulted in a 10% overall improvement for Chrome since August 2024. Google says this 10% boost could save all Chrome users roughly "58 million hours" when browsing, thanks to reduced website loading times.</p><p>To do this, the company says its Chrome team "focused on refining fundamental rendering paths across the entire stack." But achieving faster browsing speeds also meant Google needed to rethink how the browser leverages a computer's CPU caches.</p><p>Moreover, Chrome's improvements saw a major shift in how it optimized memory layouts. Google's team also reduced the number of "non-relevant" items Chrome caches. The post adds that an update to Chrome's usage of Apple Advanced Typography technology (for font shaping performance) speeds up the browser wherever text is.</p><h2 id="chrome-s-getting-faster-2">Chrome's getting faster</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MoqaNuc7sYrwQGd2Usbkcj" name="Google-Chrome-Android.jpg" alt="Google Chrome logo on a phone screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MoqaNuc7sYrwQGd2Usbkcj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google Chrome has consistently worked on its browsing speed in recent history, and its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chrome-blows-the-competition-away-in-speedometer-3-tests">stunning Speedometer 3 tests</a> in 2024 were no exception. Since the benchmark debuted, Google said its browser improved by roughly 72%. What it highlighted last year was optimization for slower functions, which directly contributed to Chrome's overall speed increase.</p><p>Additionally, Google said Chrome was outfitted with better memory usage when drawing shapes while also cutting out "redundant" processes.</p><p>The latest test and the one from 2024 focused on computers, but that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chrome-doubled-its-speedometer-scores-on-android-with-the-help-of-snapdragon-8-elite">doesn't mean Android phones were left out</a>, especially those with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>. A new version of Chrome, specifically enhanced for higher-end Android devices, doubled its old score on the Speedometer 2.1 test. There's no single way users will notice Chrome's improvements on mobile devices, as Google says these upgrades will affect all facets of browsing. Opening large documents should be a lot smoother and quicker, just to name an aspect.</p><p>With Qualcomm's latest flagship chip, Chrome on Android scored 33.3, blowing its old 18.4 score out of the water.</p><p>Regarding its recent test, Google says it will continue to enhance Chrome's browsing capabilities, and more updates will be on the way.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The tablet is believed to be coming in only one colorway, the Storm Blue.</p><p>The screen boasts of being the best tablet display, measuring 13.2 inches, featuring 3.4K resolution, and a 7:5 aspect ratio. Underneath, alongside the flagship Qualcomm chipset, it features 12GB of RAM and 256GB of onboard storage. Additionally, it also has a vapor chamber cooling system to ensure users have a smoother high-end gaming experience.</p><p>The prominent aspect of the OnePlus Pad 3 is its massive 12,140mAh battery capacity, with support for 80W Supervooc charging. It promises 17-hour-long video playback, 70 days of standby, an extra 18 percent battery with a quick 10-minute charge.

Rumors have swirled about Apple creating an ultra-slim iPhone 17 Air, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review">Galaxy S25 Edge</a> was soon teased in January 2025, launching in May. While the company may have thought it had finally won a major race against the Cupertino-based tech giant, the Galaxy S25 Edge might turn out to be yet another case of Samsung focusing and allocating resources in the wrong places.</p><p>I bought the Galaxy S25 Edge, and even <em>I </em>can see the phone's apparent flaws. I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/3-reasons-id-instantly-buy-an-ultra-slim-phone-like-the-rumored-galaxy-s25-slim">asked for Samsung to make this kind of ultra-thin smartphone</a> way back in November, in fact. To make this kind of controversial, niche device a hit, Samsung needs to address its flaws head-on. Not pretend they don't exist, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-top-exec-addresses-galaxy-s25-edge-battery-woes">which is what it's doing</a>.</p><p>Even fans of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy">Samsung Galaxy</a> product line seem to <em>hate</em> the Edge, and that isn't an exaggeration. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/samsunggalaxy/comments/1kltccf/what_are_your_thoughts_on_the_galaxy_s25_edge/" target="_blank">Posts</a> on the Samsung Galaxy subreddit — a place where you'd expect the sentiment around Samsung devices to be somewhat favorable — are littered with complaints about the new device. One comment called the Galaxy S25 Edge the "dumbest Samsung ever" and added that it was "overpriced, unnecessary, and false advertisement." It has over 100 upvotes.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ErMAYgHCMkvNch3RFBGxvZ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-5" alt="The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge compared to an iPhone 16 Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ErMAYgHCMkvNch3RFBGxvZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge (left) compared to the iPhone 16 Pro (right). </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s25-edges-early-sales-seem-to-be-as-slim-as-the-phone-new-report-claims">hasn't disclosed early sales figures for the Galaxy S25 Edge</a>, which is somewhat odd for the company. It often shares sales data from its pre-order and launch period in its home market of South Korea, but it neglected to do so for this launch. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-is-struggling-to-sell-the-galaxy-s25-edge/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a> reports that its sources say sales are below expectations for the smartphone.</p><p>If that's true, I'm not surprised. Samsung's messaging regarding the Galaxy S25 Edge has been far from clear. Instead of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/doechii-x-edge-live-event/" target="_blank">collaborating with Doechii</a>, the brand should have tried to convince people that the Galaxy S25 Edge <em>isn't</em> a flawed smartphone. Samsung should remind them that all the thick, heavy, and bulky smartphones on the market are really the flawed ones.</p><p>That's why I bought the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-vs-iphone-16-pro">to replace my iPhone 16 Pro</a>. The latter is thick and heavy to the point that it's inconvenient. All the feature advantages it has over the Galaxy S25 Edge are inconsequential because of its size. I don't want to hold the phone up at a concert and use its 5x telephoto lens because it's heavy. Nor do I want to keep it in my pocket at the gym, or fight a weight imbalance when using the on-screen keyboard.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tuPHaVDkhBn62k9zCiCyUZ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-6" alt="The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge with an Anker MagSafe battery pack attached." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tuPHaVDkhBn62k9zCiCyUZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Galaxy S25 Edge can go more places and do more things <em>because</em> it is thin, not in spite of its thickness.

Charge your phone when you can throughout the day, like in your car or at your desk, and the Galaxy S25 Edge can free you from a big-battery smartphone that feels like a brick.</p><p>That's how I would've pitched the Galaxy S25 Edge to smartphone users.

Last year, Samsung copied Apple in designing the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">Galaxy Buds 3 Pro</a>. Things got so bad a Samsung executive was reportedly furious with the so-called "design plagiarism."</p><p>More recently, Samsung introduced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review">One UI 7</a> with iOS-like features, such as a split notification shade and quick settings panel. Longtime <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oneui/comments/1kk9kxe/oneui_70_is_now_too_ios_for_me/" target="_blank">Galaxy users aren't happy</a>. And to top things off, the Galaxy S25 Edge looks like a carbon copy of the iPhone 16 from the back.</p><p>All these controversial changes aren't working. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/insight/top-10-bestselling-smartphones-q1-2025/" target="_blank">Counterpoint Research</a> recently revealed that the top four best-selling smartphones in the first quarter of 2025 were all iPhones. The first Samsung phone on the list earned the fifth-place slot, and the flagship <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> fell to seventh place. For perspective, the Galaxy S24 Ultra was the fifth best-selling phone in Q1 2024 a year ago — also behind four iPhones.</p><p>Samsung doesn't appear to be adapting or adjusting to feedback. With software updates like One UI 7 and phone releases like the Galaxy S25 Edge, it's creating products that its top supporters actively dislike.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WFoTTsChjLzmiZvU9VhvwX" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-2" alt="The side profile of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WFoTTsChjLzmiZvU9VhvwX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's a good phone that I think is misunderstood, and I blame Samsung for that, not the contrarians. The company made a phone that it needed to really sell to its customer base, despite its shortcomings, and it hasn't. Instead, Samsung is bullishly (and foolishly, I would say) saying that the Galaxy S25 Edge isn't a flawed phone at all.</p><p>"We really designed this from the ground up to be thin. The goal was to be thin without compromise," said Blake Gaiser, Samsung's director of smartphone product management in America, in an interview with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/phones/samsung-phones/exclusive-samsung-exec-shuts-down-the-galaxy-s25-edge-haters-talks-triple-foldable" target="_blank">Tom's Guide</a>. Gaiser also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-top-exec-addresses-galaxy-s25-edge-battery-woes">didn't do much to address the concerns of people who aren't happy</a> with the phone's 3,900mAh battery or lack of a telephoto lens.</p><p>Samsung can't seem to read the room, and that's true regardless of whether I love the Galaxy S25 Edge (which I do).</p> ]]></dc:content>

Instead of launching the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-4">Quest 4</a> anytime soon, the company is said to be hustling to get a whole new lightweight headset out by 2026. This one will reportedly have a separate compute pack, ditching the all-in-one style we’re used to.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/meta-prioritizing-puffin-for-2026-pushing-out-quest-4-to-2027/" target="_blank">UploadVR’s sources</a>, Meta has pulled the plug on "Pismo Low" and "Pismo High"—the two headsets that were in the running for the next Quest. That pretty much means we’re not seeing a true Quest 4 until at least 2027.</p><p>The outlet reports that Meta is betting big on a super lightweight headset for 2026, powered by Horizon OS. Internally called “Puffin,” this new device is shaping up to ditch the bulk of past Quest headsets in favor of something way sleeker and easier to wear.</p><h2 id="compute-on-the-go-2">Compute-on-the-go</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="y3hwKe6dJGGZrjKtLCGf5C" name="meta-quest-3-covering-cameras" alt="Covering the cameras on a Meta Quest 3 while wearing the headset" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y3hwKe6dJGGZrjKtLCGf5C.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Puffin takes a different route—it offloads the processing power to a small external puck instead of cramming everything into the headset. It is said to be small enough to stash in your jacket pocket. While that might sound a bit like Apple Vision Pro’s external battery setup, there’s a key difference here that sets Meta’s take apart.</p><p>The scoop first dropped last year via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/meta-considers-mixed-reality-glasses-code-named-puffin" target="_blank">The Information</a>. Instead of the bulky look, Puffin is said to resemble a chunky pair of glasses and reportedly weighs under 100g.</p><p>On top of that, the device is supposedly ditching the usual controllers and going all-in on hand tracking.

Since acquiring Oculus in 2014, the company has produced nearly a dozen different VR headsets, and while VR's commercial success is tepid when compared to smartphones, Meta's ambitions always went beyond becoming the next PlayStation or Nintendo.</p><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">AC thVRsday</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LGmZZrc8DWcxmZm6RRUYbC" name="ac-thvrsday-logo.jpg" caption="" alt="AC thVRsday logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LGmZZrc8DWcxmZm6RRUYbC.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text">In his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/ac-thvrsday">weekly column</a>, Android Central Senior Content Producer Nick Sutrich delves into all things VR, from new hardware to new games, upcoming technologies, and so much more.</p></div></div><p>A new partnership with Anduril, a company founded by Palmer Luckey, who was <em>also</em> the founder of Oculus VR, ensures that Meta's ambitions see fruition in the near future. That's because this goes beyond mere commercial or gaming products and, instead, is geared right toward the U.S. government and military, which scoffs at the idea of spending tens of billions on any given day.</p><p>Anduril's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.anduril.com/article/anduril-and-meta-team-up-to-transform-xr-for-the-american-military/">press release</a> notes that technologies that will be delivered have "been funded through private capital, without taxpayer support, and [are] designed to save the U.S. military billions of dollars by utilizing high-performance components and technology originally built for commercial use."</p><p>That last part is the most important. It signals to me that the money Meta Reality Labs has spent over the past decade will finally receive the public justification that Mark Zuckerberg has been seeking, and the expansion provided by new government projects will transform R&D projects like Meta Orion into fully commercialized counterparts.</p><h2 id="roll-out-the-assembly-line-2">Roll out the assembly line</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:52.20%;"><img id="Jk3UECN7i7RF3Wi6pzBVY" name="meta-orion-assembly-line" alt="A product render of special edition Meta Orion smart glasses on an assembly line belt" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Jk3UECN7i7RF3Wi6pzBVY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1069" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Adobe Stock / Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The last two years have seen a significant increase in the availability and demand for smart glasses. I would argue that 2023's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review" target="_blank">Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses</a> were the first smart glasses product that made any real waves in the sector, and even then, that didn't even happen until Meta AI support was rolled out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-multimodal-ai-video-calling-update" target="_blank">six months after launch</a>.</p><p>Now, we're looking at a year where we could see a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-with-display-rumor">third-generation Ray-Ban Meta</a> release alongside a new pair of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/my-demo-with-googles-ar-glasses-went-better-than-the-one-on-stage">Google AR glasses</a>, as well as a smattering of other companies, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-project-aura-google-io-2025-xreal-eye" target="_blank">such as</a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-project-aura-google-io-2025-xreal-eye"> Xreal</a>.</p><p>However, none of these glasses appear to be as advanced as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Meta Orion</a>, which felt very much like a pair of glasses with a Meta Quest headset somehow crammed inside. Of course, there's a very good reason for that: cost. In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynLm-QvsW0Q">an in-depth interview</a> last October, Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth noted that production-level Orion glasses would cost $10,000 a pair if Meta started selling them last Fall.</p><div><blockquote><p>What better way to fund expensive assembly lines than with the help of seemingly unlimited military budgets?</p></blockquote></div><p>That's because the technology to mass-produce something like Orion simply doesn't exist. It could be built, yes, but it would cost <em>billions</em> to do it, and that cost would have to be passed on to the consumer in the form of $10,000 glasses that only a few rich enthusiasts would be able to justify.</p><p>So, what better outlet to fund this eventual road to commercialization than the U.S. government, and more specifically, the U.S. military? After all, the 2025 fiscal budget alone for the Department of Defence amounts to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3703410/department-of-defense-releases-the-presidents-fiscal-year-2025-defense-budget/#:~:text=The%20President%27s%20Fiscal%20Year%202025%20Budget%20Request%20for%20the%20Department,people%2C%20and%20succeeding%20through%20teamwork." target="_blank">$849.8 billion</a>, or roughly 14 times what Meta has spent on R&D over the past decade.</p><p>The military won't be terribly concerned with $10,000 glasses if they can finally achieve the goal Microsoft's Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS) project tried to achieve in 2021 for the cost of around $20 billion. Anduril took over that contract this year in February, and now it's partnering with Meta to ensure its cutting-edge AI-powered software is backed by Meta's bleeding-edge AR hardware.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZgJbwGhdEApmwWDwVfTiM6" name="meta-project-orion-ar-glasses-hands-on-04.jpg" alt="Photo of Nick Sutrich wearing and using the Meta Orion AR glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZgJbwGhdEApmwWDwVfTiM6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Palmer Luckey's return to working with Meta is only one part of the miracles that had to occur for this future to pan out. Luckey was fired from Facebook two years after the company acquired his Oculus VR company, likely due to political reasons. "The people who ousted me, who orchestrated my destruction, who seized my baby from me, are not even at Meta anymore," Luckey said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.threads.com/@heaney_555/post/DKQdTFjIjkJ?xmt=AQF0wNqNu-DcDWwbIguM5jRl-jUm5LmpJlq0E3J0JXF-Ew">in an interview</a> last month.</p><p>This made it possible for Luckey and Zuckerberg to form a new partnership that would benefit both of them, helping to bridge the gap between AR and VR technologies that Luckey had created with those that Meta has funded since he departed from the company nearly a decade ago.</p><p>Better yet, Luckey notes that these new headsets <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/gVXPERyRjOA?si=01TngSzb6cwai09E&t=3015">will be entirely made in America</a>, yet another miracle that seemed impossible in an electronics industry almost entirely dependent on China.</p><div><blockquote><p>Palmer Luckey's return to Meta's good graces ensures something huge is on the horizon.</p></blockquote></div><p>In fact, the partnership appears to encompass all of Meta's Reality Labs experiments, including Meta AI and its associated components.  "The collaboration builds on Meta's existing Reality Labs investments and its work supporting adoption of its Llama open source AI models for national security uses by the U.S. and its closest allies."</p><p>Once the assembly lines are built and resources are in place, it's a clear road to the affordable, American-made smart glasses that were once a part of science fiction. It could even be the path to something far greater than smart glasses, if all the right resources are in place to move more manufacturing to the U.S.</p><p>At the very least, it's the path that Zuckerberg can use to claim he's been right all along, amidst the visionless stock market investors who have complained their way through the last decade of Reality Labs' spending.</p> ]]></dc:content>

With a gorgeous PANTONE-certified vegan leather back, a better water and dust resistance rating than you'll find on any other phone in this price range, battery life that'll last longer than you expect, and super-fast 68W charging, this phone looks good doing what it does best.</p><p>It's even got <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a> packed in, and while <em>all</em> the AI features from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Motorola Razr Ultra</a> aren't here, it does feature some of the most prominent ones. But so much of the experience is needlessly held back by a slow processor that struggles to do even the most basic tasks. Swiping home takes far too long, and tasks like opening the camera or switching apps make this feel more like a phone half its price.</p><p>That doesn't mean there are no redeeming qualities here — the camera is quite excellent, for instance — but the experience is so held back by this processor that it's impossible to recommend at full price. If you really want one, wait for a good deal and get it for a lot cheaper, or just choose a Pixel 9a or OnePlus 13R, instead.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-motorola-edge-2025-price-availability-and-specs"><span>Motorola Edge 2025: Price, availability, and specs</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Pepc5Uw2LsaFz5XLgc5XKk" name="Motorola-Edge-2025-display-hello-moto-setup" alt="The initial "Hello Moto" setup screen that appears when you first turn on the Motorola Edge 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Pepc5Uw2LsaFz5XLgc5XKk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Motorola Edge 2025 will be available in the U.S. unlocked on June 5 at Best Buy, Amazon, and Motorola.com for $549.99.

While some folks will be unhappy with the curved glass, it makes for a gorgeous phone that, when combined with the vegan leather back, makes it hard not to admire it constantly throughout the day.</p><p>It's also quite thin and light feeling thanks to the tapered edges, and the choice of PANTONE Forest Green is simply stunning. It's hard to find a better looking phone than this, even if it means finding a good tempered glass protector will be tough.</p><p>On top of being thin and light, this is one of the elite phones to feature an IP68/IP69 water and dust resistance rating, meaning it can take a real beating, be put in the dishwasher, and still come out running like a champ. It's also got a giant 5,200mAh battery inside that gives this stellar battery life, and 68W charging ensures you only need a few minutes to top the phone up before heading out the door.</p><div

Both phones feature a lot of similar tools, like AI art generators, great ways to transcribe recordings, and more. Motorola sets itself apart with some unique features like Catch Me Up, which can instantly take all those notifications and give you an executive summary, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/how-use-moto-ai-playlist-studio">AI playlist</a>, which can give you a curated music playlist in seconds.</p><p>Much of this is powered by the new Moto AI button on the left, which can be customized to your liking. If you don't like this, you can disable the key altogether. It's nice to have that feature!</p><p>If I had any one critique about Moto AI, it's that I wish it were a bit more proactive. Catch me up would be great if it automatically ran when I unlocked the phone after an extended period of time, for instance. I think this is an excellent start, though, and Motorola will certainly tweak and improve things over time.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-motorola-edge-2025-what-s-not-good"><span>Motorola Edge 2025: What's not good</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rNFXzFjPrPc8cK25YXYWnC" name="Motorola-Edge-2025-home-screen-03" alt="The home screen of the Motorola Edge 2025 in its default configuration" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rNFXzFjPrPc8cK25YXYWnC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Editorials</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI: everything you need to know</a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-motorola-magic-canvas">How to create AI-generated wallpaper with Moto AI</a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/how-use-moto-ai-playlist-studio">How to create an AI-generated playlist with Moto AI</a></p></div></div><p>The MediaTek Dimensity 7400 inside this phone holds everything back substantially. It's not a bad processor, but it doesn't belong in a $550 phone. Period. Motorola sells the international model of this phone under the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-edge-60-fusion-announced">Motorola Edge 60 Fusion</a> name, and it's roughly 30% cheaper than the Motorola Edge 2025.</p><p>As I've used this phone over the past week, I've encountered numerous performance issues, including hitches, lags, and stutters. These are not present in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">Google Pixel 9a</a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a>, both of which are in the same price range.</p><p>Turning off the silly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ram-boost-explained">RAM Boost feature</a> helped performance for me, but it didn't erase the lags and stutters completely. This processor is also not performant enough to even run Minecraft's Vibrant Visuals setting at a playable frame rate. It's really a shame because, while this processor is marginally faster than last year's Edge 2024 processor, it pales in comparison to other phones at this price range.</p><div><blockquote><p>While most elements of the phone are excellent, the slow processors holds the entire experience back.</p></blockquote></div><p>While Motorola says the display is better than last year's, my own tests tell me otherwise. The small bump in resolution isn't worth the tradeoff in refresh rate, and this display has mura issues in addition to using color dithering to fake deeper colors than the panel can actually produce. Motorola still ships it with the excellent full DC dimming mode that I lauded the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-2023-review">Motorola Edge Plus 2023</a> for, but the aggressive dithering means this isn't a great display for sensitive eyes.</p><p>The Motorola Edge 2025 is only slated for two OS upgrades and three years of bi-monthly security updates. By comparison, Google and Samsung offer seven years of both at this price range, and companies like OnePlus offer five years, further reducing the value of this phone.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-motorola-edge-2025-competition"><span>Motorola Edge 2025: Competition</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="h89PYP9Hr4tnMLVQUwC8Wo" name="OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13R review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h89PYP9Hr4tnMLVQUwC8Wo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Motorola's biggest problem is that there is steep competition at this price point. If you're buying unlocked, your money is better spend on a Google Pixel 9a or a OnePlus 13R. My recommendation would be the OnePlus 13R for several reasons.</p><p>The OnePlus 13R features a substantially faster processor — nearly 200% faster, actually — plus four OS updates and six years of security updates. That's double what Motorola offers. It's not going to have quite as many AI features as Moto AI offers, but I don't think those things are device sellers, just fun stuff to have.</p><p>The Google Pixel 9a is a great second choice that comes in a little cheaper at $499. The Pixel 9a also delivers a faster processor than the Motorola Edge 2025, but not as fast as the OnePlus 13R's processor. It upgrades the software update policy to seven years of OS <em>and</em> security updates, though, so this is a phone that you can potentially hold on to for a long time.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-motorola-edge-2025-should-you-buy"><span>Motorola Edge 2025: Should you buy</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wA5y2ow7qmts2XPvdcgqiT" name="Motorola-Edge-2025-camera-01" alt="Taking a macro shot of red flowers with the Motorola Edge 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wA5y2ow7qmts2XPvdcgqiT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p><ul><li>You can get a great deal from a carrier.</li><li>You love Motorola's design, including the excellent vegan leather backs.</li><li>You want a phone with excellent battery life and fast charging.</li></ul><p><strong>You should not buy this if...</strong></p><ul><li>You get easily irritated by phones with slower processors.</li><li>You want to hold on to your phone for more than three years.</li><li>You hate curved screens.</li></ul><p>For the second year in a row, Motorola has made an excellent Edge phone that is simply too expensive for its own good.

You'll experience plenty of stutters and lags as you use the phone, and while turning off RAM Boost helps some, the experience is simply worse than other phones you can get for the same price. Plus, with only three years of updates, it's going to last half as long as a Pixel 9a or OnePlus 13R.

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>My wife summed up the OnePlus 13s perfectly: "this just looks like a smaller iPhone, but with Android." That's basically what it is to use the OnePlus 13s; while it is good to see OnePlus making a compact device — the OnePlus X came out a decade ago — the 13s ends up deviating a bit too much from the manufacturer's design language.</p><p>Look, I get that most phones these days have a similar design, and I'm okay with that; switching to a flatter profile allows brands to slot in massive batteries, and that's undoubtedly a good thing. But with the 13s, it feels like OnePlus intentionally tried to make a device that's as close to the iPhone as possible, and it isn't just the hardware design — the changes to OxygenOS bring it closer to iOS.</p><p>I had the OnePlus 13s for over a month, and I used the device extensively in that time. This is what you need to know about OnePlus' compact flagship, and whether you should pick it up.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-13s-specs-price-and-global-availability"><span>OnePlus 13s: Specs, price, and global availability</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="LeWaEqBKVwUhoGaSAn5T93" name="OnePlus 13s" alt="OnePlus 13s review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LeWaEqBKVwUhoGaSAn5T93.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>OnePlus unveiled the 13s in India on June 5, and the phone is going on sale in the country in the coming weeks. The device is identical to the OnePlus 13T that debuted in China back in April, with two differences: the 13s has a smaller 5,850mAh battery (the 13T has 6,260mAh), and the 13s gets a 32MP selfie camera with autofocus.</p><p>The 13s is available in two configurations: the base model with 12GB/256GB storage is going on sale in India starting at ₹54,999 ($640), and there's also a 12GB/512GB model that costs ₹59,999 ($699). The device basically slots in between the OnePlus 13R and OnePlus 13, and it isn't quite as affordable as I thought it would be.</p><p>Why the name change to 13s, you ask? OnePlus says it did so to highlight the fact that this is a smaller phone. As to why it didn't do so in China, your guess is as good as mine. Although the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a> is available globally, OnePlus isn't selling the 13s outside India, and the 13T is exclusive to China.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>OnePlus 13s</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.32 -inch 120Hz LTPO AMOLED, 2640x1216, 1600 nits max</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>OxygenOS 15 based on Android 15</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Chipset</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite, Adreno 830, 3nm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>12GB LPDDR5X</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB/512GB UFS 4.0</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear camera 1</p></td><td  ><p>50MP Sony Lytia LYT-700, PDAF, OIS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear camera 2</p></td><td  ><p>50MP Samsung JN5 tele, 2x optical zoom</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Front camera</p></td><td  ><p>32MP GalaxyCore GC32, autofocus, 4K video</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ingress protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP65 dust and water resistance</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6.0, limited 5G bands, NFC, dual-band GPS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Security</p></td><td  ><p>Optical in-screen sensor</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Audio</p></td><td  ><p>USB-C, stereo sound, AptX HD, LDAC, LHDC 5.0 </p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>5,850mAh battery, 80W charging</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>150.8 x 71.7 x 8.2mm, 185g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Green, Pink, Black</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-13s-design"><span>OnePlus 13s: Design</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5050px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.34%;"><img id="oyLyqYW39pBzTkzpvZpRz" name="OnePlus 13s" alt="OnePlus 13s review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oyLyqYW39pBzTkzpvZpRz.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5050" height="2845" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>The OnePlus 13s has a compact design with a good in-hand feel. </strong></li><li><strong>However, the design closely resembles that of an iPhone. </strong></li><li><strong>The phone is limited to IP65 water resistance, and the optical fingerprint sensor isn't in an ideal location. </strong></li></ul><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Roundups</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-small-android-phone"><strong>Best compact phones<br></strong></a><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones"><strong>Best affordable phones</strong></a><strong><br>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones"><strong>Best OnePlus phones</strong></a></p></div></div><p>OnePlus says the 13s has a "stunning new design," but what it actually looks like is an iPhone.

OnePlus made several changes to the software this year, and the design brings it closer to iOS. A new addition is AI Plus Mind, a feature that collates photos, notes, and other data in a single location. If you have any information you'd like to save — bills, event QR codes, and so on — just press and hold the Plus Key, and it gets saved to Mind Space.</p><p>The utility uses machine learning to extract relevant information. If that sounds familiar, it's because Nothing's Essential Space basically does the same thing, and if anything, Google's Pixel Screenshots has a similar utility. I'll admit that it is useful in certain scenarios, but as of now, it doesn't do much other than summarizing information.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="Bq8UuJomJEBE2pqYV9y5G3" name="OnePlus 13s" alt="OnePlus 13s review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Bq8UuJomJEBE2pqYV9y5G3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You can't take your data out either, so it is tied to the device. As it stands, there isn't much to justify the feature, but it's clear that the manufacturer sees AI as a point of differentiation (like every other phone brand), so it should get better features in the coming months.</p><p>Most of the time, using the software on the 13s was an exercise in frustration. I migrated data from the Vivo X200 Pro, but it didn't install everything — basic apps like Amazon and Swiggy didn't show up, and I had to go to the Play Store and download these again. This is never an issue on other devices, but I ran into the same problem on the OnePlus 13 earlier this year, so I'm highlighting it.</p><p>Background memory management continues to be very aggressive, so if you have an app in the background, it will be shut down after a few hours. There is intermittent lag when browsing in Chrome, and it could just be a case of the device not being optimized ahead of launch, as I didn't see this issue on the regular model.</p><p>And then there's the usual AI-backed features. You get AI Search and AI transcribing along with translation, and they do a decent enough job. There's a new AI Call Assistant, and it is meant to provide real-time translation. I tested it with Hindi to English, and it just didn't do a good enough job translating the call on the fly; the resultant text was wrong in many areas, and it wasn't able to handle entire sentences.</p><p>Coming to updates, the 13s will get the standard four years of Android updates alongside six years of security patches.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-13s-the-alternatives"><span>OnePlus 13s: The alternatives</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="z8HbCAz4dXgnQR3uQFhnma" name="iqoo-13-16.jpg" alt="iQOO 13 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/z8HbCAz4dXgnQR3uQFhnma.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I like the OnePlus 13R, and although it isn't as fast as the 13s, you won't notice any difference in daily use, and it has a bigger AMOLED panel and larger battery.

You get standout battery life, and the main camera takes good photos and videos.</p><p>That said, I'm not a fan of the design or the software. OxygenOS 15 is now veering so close to iOS that it just doesn't have any originality left, and there are enough annoyances with bugs that it wasn't enjoyable to use the phone. I'm sure these will be resolved a few weeks after the phone goes on sale — that's always been the case in the last three years — but I don't see why these couldn't be addressed beforehand, like every other phone manufacturer is able to do.</p><p>Most of the time, I felt like I was beta testing the 13s. The OnePlus 13 continues to be an outlier in that it didn't have any of these issues out of the box, and with the 13s, OnePlus is back to its usual shenanigans of launching a phone before it's ready. If you're willing to wait a few weeks (or even months), then the 13s has the potential to be a decent enough choice in this category. But as it stands, it just doesn't measure up.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The phone shares the same silicon as the OnePlus 13, and you get the 13R's main camera and a massive battery.
