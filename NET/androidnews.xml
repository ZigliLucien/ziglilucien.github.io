Make sure to <a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=androidcentral.com" target="_blank"><strong>set Android Central as a preferred source</strong></a> in Google Search, and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should"><strong>find out why you should</strong></a> so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>Google's recent Quick Share update, intended to streamline file sharing between Pixel 10 devices and Apple users, has inadvertently led to Wi-Fi connectivity issues, leaving many users frustrated as their connections drop at the mere touch of the app (as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://piunikaweb.com/2025/11/27/pixel-10-quick-share-airdrop-wifi-bug/">Piunika Web</a>).</p><p>Some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/389198355?hl=en">users took to Google's forum</a> to report that opening the Quick Share menu immediately kills the phone's Wi-Fi connection. The user said that as soon as they opened the sharing menu to send a file, the Wi-Fi disconnected. And when they try to reconnect while the menu is open, the network list shows their network, but they won't connect to it.</p><p>According to several reports so far, this issue stems from the new Quick Share extension update (1.0.815689706). According to another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1p3320u/wifi_drooping_issues_after_installing_quick_share/">user on Reddit</a>, their Pixel 10 Pro XL began malfunctioning immediately after the Quick Share extension update. After a quick troubleshooting of the extension, they were able to confirm that the Wi-Fi issue stemmed from this update alone.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="uVPvRdGgC9SE7kcFMPTVa5" name="google-pixel-10-vs-10-pro-obsidian-side-01" alt="Comparing the obsidian colorsways of the Google Pixel 10 with the obsidian Google Pixel 10 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uVPvRdGgC9SE7kcFMPTVa5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What could likely be causing this issue, according to Gemini, is that the standard Wi-Fi hardware (like in the Pixel) is usually built for Wi-Fi Direct (a standard protocol). But now with this new update, Google could be forcing this hardware to emulate <strong>AWDL</strong> (a proprietary Apple protocol), which could be causing the network to get glitchy and drop out.</p><p>While Google hasn't yet officially addressed the issue, some temporary workarounds are being passed around that could help fix this issue. Pixel 10 users have two options to choose from: You can either choose to get rid of this extension until a fix arrives, by heading to <strong>Settings > Apps > See all apps</strong>, locating the "Quick Share extension," and selecting "Uninstall updates."</p><p>Or, if you urgently need to send a file to an Apple device, you can temporarily bypass the driver conflict by manually toggling your Wi-Fi off before opening the Quick Share menu; this forces the transfer to happen via Bluetooth or mobile data, though you may need to restart your phone afterward to connect back to your Wi-Fi.</p><p>Android Central has reached out to Google about the issue, and we'll update this article once we have more information.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Make sure to <a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=androidcentral.com" target="_blank"><strong>set Android Central as a preferred source</strong></a> in Google Search, and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should"><strong>find out why you should</strong></a> so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>Google has stealthily slashed access limits for its popular Gemini 3 Pro and Nano Banana Pro tools, adjusting free-tier users' daily prompts amid soaring demand, leaving many to navigate new restrictions without prior warning in a rapidly changing digital landscape.</p><p>Since its debut, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-3-pro-googles-new-ai-model-aims-to-redefine-multimodal-understanding">Gemini 3 Pro</a> used to let you make five prompts a day, but now Google only promises “basic access,” meaning the limits can change based on demand. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/nano-banana-goes-pro-with-refined-design-consistency-and-accuracy-in-the-gemini-app">Nano Banana Pro</a> also cut the number of free image creations from three to two per day. Google didn’t make a big announcement about these changes; they just showed up on the updated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/16275805" target="_blank">support page</a>, first noticed by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/11/27/gemini-3-pro-free-limits/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>.</p><p>More people are using Gemini 3 Pro than Google probably expected. The model offers better reasoning, more features, and clearer visuals thanks to Nano Banana Pro’s improved rendering engine.</p><p>This high demand puts a lot of strain on Google’s servers, especially since access is free. To avoid problems, Google is quietly reducing free access so the platform keeps working well for everyone.</p><p>The move also nudges heavier users — people who rely on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/gemini">Gemini</a> for research, writing, or content creation — toward paid upgrades like Google's $20/month AI Pro Plan if they want stable performance and consistent access to the top-tier model.</p><h2 id="forced-downgrade-2">Forced downgrade</h2><p>Under these new limits, free users aren’t locked out entirely, but hitting the cap now pushes them back to Google’s Fast model.</p><p>NotebookLM is also running into some capacity issues, as per Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/NotebookLM/status/1993387297081827346" target="_blank">post on X</a>, so a few of its smarter tools are getting dialed back for now. Free users can’t access Infographics or Slide Decks at the moment, and even Pro subscribers are seeing new limits to help keep the service stable for everyone.</p><p>For casual users, these new limits might not be a problem. If you only ask a question or two each day, you may never reach the cap. But people who use Gemini 3 Pro for daily work will notice the restrictions right away.</p><p>The situation is even more frustrating because there’s no clear indicator of how many prompts remain — the system simply switches models when it decides you’ve had enough for the day.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Notably, while competitors increased the lengths of their installment plans to 36 months, T-Mobile's installments — officially called equipment installment plans (EIPs) — remained at 24 months and 0% interest. Now, it looks like T-Mobile is finally following in its competitors' footsteps, and is launching 36-month installment plans  for certain products.</p><p>This doesn't come as a major surprise, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/t-mobile">T-Mobile</a> mistakenly added 36-month installment plans to its website in June 2025, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://tmo.report/2025/06/t-mobile-might-be-switching-to-36-month-installments/" target="_blank">The Mobile Report</a>. Those quickly disappeared and the 24-month terms remained until this weekend, when T-Mobile rolled out 36-month installment plans for smartwatches and tablets. Customers now only have the option of paying for their device in full or choosing a T-Mobile installment plan with a term length of three years.</p><p>The updated terms heavily incentives T-Mobile subscribers to remain with the carrier for the length of the installment plan, and avoid upgrading their devices earlier. Like many carriers, T-Mobile entices users to sign up for installment plans by offering credits and promotions that lower the overall cost of a new device. Those "get a new phone on us" deals only apply when you sign up for an installment plan.</p><p>Signing up for a T-Mobile installment plan technically doesn't lock you into paying for your phone service for the full three years. However,  those promotional device credits are paid out on a monthly basis. That means if you cancel service or need to upgrade your device early, you'll be on the hook for the remaining installment plan balance. In other words, people who buy tablets and smartwatches through T-Mobile installment plans can only upgrade every three years now, as opposed to two, if they want to get all their promotional credits.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CaZPop38EcXFxyZTngNwWZ" name="t-mobile-postpaid-magenta-on-s20.jpg" alt="T-Mobile Magenta plan information on an S20+" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CaZPop38EcXFxyZTngNwWZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samuel Contreras)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The change is yet another occurrence where T-Mobile is caught using tactics it previously mocked competing carriers for employing. Just earlier this month, T-Mobile's consumer group president acknowledged how 36-month installment plans limit upgrades and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-switch-carriers-att-t-mobile-verizon-sprint">carrier-switching</a> at the Wells Fargo Summit (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/t-mobile-36-months-installments-eips-tablets-watches_id176095" target="_blank">PhoneArena</a>).</p><div><blockquote><p>Remember, there was, you know, two of our competitors had, you know, introduced financing constructs over 36 months. That probably artificially suppressed some of the upgrade activity, some of the switching activity in the marketplace.</p><p>John Freier, President T-Mobile Consumer Group</p></blockquote></div><p>The big question is whether T-Mobile's longer installment plans will eventually extend to smartphones. For now, the 36-month term lengths only apply to tablets and smartwatches. If applied to smartphone plans in the future, T-Mobile would lose yet another differentiating factor between it and competitors like AT&T and Verizon.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Typically, Samsung's device colors offer their distinct coloring on the back panel, leaving the frame with a lighter, almost metal hue. What Ice Universe suggests is that Samsung will change its darkest hue by wrapping the coloring over its edges, especially around its display.</p><p>The tipster states, "This time, the Galaxy S26 Ultra black version features a black frame." However, it seems consumers might be in for a slight visual anomaly if this happens.</p><p>The post on X states, "overall visual bezel is inevitably wider," because of the black edges around the display. The bezels are the black border around a display, a distinct marker that separates the display from its edges. If that <em>and </em>the frame is black, it might give the illusion that the S26 Ultr has massive bezels, when that (might not) be the case.</p><p>User comments on X have gone separate ways, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/emn_mora/status/1994011013981548727?s=20">some users praising</a> this potential, while others claim we're <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/joemama_0609/status/1993877598196388200?s=20">headed for scratch central</a>. Another tipster, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/theonecid/status/1993865319237210232?s=20">theonecid</a>, chimed in with a mock-up rendering of what a true Jet Black Galaxy S26 Ultra could look like. The frame is a little glossy, not quite as matte as what the series currently offers. It remains to be seen what Samsung truly does with the colors next year.</p><h2 id="looking-to-26-2">Looking to '26</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This time, the Galaxy S26 Ultra black version features a black frame, not the lighter silver, so the overall visual bezel is inevitably wider.<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1993859554291896566">November 27, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>We've <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s26-ultra-renders-leak">had some renders</a> for the Galaxy S26 Ultra leak before, though these were more about the possible design changes Samsung could implement. It's currently rumored that the S26 Ultra may adopt a more Galaxy Z Fold 7-style approach by adding that little island beneath its vertically lined cameras. This would, as you'd expect, give a bit of a camera bump, which the S25 Ultra lacks, aside from the camera protrusions.</p><p>Everything else, such as button placements, remains relatively the same in those leaks.</p><p>A more recent whispering from November claims that the S26 Ultra may <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s26-ultras-new-design-could-change-how-selfies-are-taken">change how users take selfies</a>. The selfie camera itself isn't rumored to change (big surprise), but what is potentially changing is the size of the lens cutout. Rumors claim the size could increase to 4mm, meaning users could have a slightly wider FOV (field of view) for their selfies.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It might be wise to look outside the box and ditch your usual OEMs. It's time to say hello to the OnePlus 13.</p><p>Samsung has a stranglehold in North America, and that's largely down to the manufacturer cozying up with phone carriers a decade and a half ago. The result is that the brand utterly dominates sales, to the extent that it is seen as the default Android choice when mulling a new purchase.</p><p>This has led to Samsung coasting in recent years, rolling out what is basically the same phone year over year. Thankfully, other manufacturers do things differently, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/one-year-with-the-oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a> in particular has been a real standout this year. The phone has a stunning design, monstrous internals, battery life that will make every Samsung user envious, cameras that hold their own against the Galaxy S25 Ultra, and a better AMOLED panel.</p><p>In short, the OnePlus 13 is a much better phone than anything Samsung has to offer at the moment, and the best part is that because it's been out for the better part of a year, it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Smartphone-Snapdragon-SUPERVOOC-Hasselblad/dp/B0DP8KZLQ3?th=1"><strong>discounted to $699 right now</strong></a>. Without overstating things, this is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best phone</a> you can get for this amount, and nothing else outshines it — even the newer OnePlus 15.

The OnePlus 13 has excellent fluidity, amazing internals, standout battery life, and great cameras.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You don't want a good phone, and want to continue using whatever Samsung comes out with every year.</p><p>Even after nearly a year of availability, the OnePlus 13 is a terrific phone. The hardware has no signs of slowing down whatsoever, and it continues to be incredibly fluid in regular use — both at mundane tasks as well as gaming.</p><p>The design has aged well too; the unique leather texture is great to hold and use, and I like that it isn't as grainy as usual leather, instead featuring a softer finish. The in-hand feel is excellent, and even though it has a 6,000mAh battery, it isn't that heavy.</p><p>On that note, battery life is excellent, and I still get a day's worth of use. The AMOLED panel is among the brightest, and you get a level of fluidity that you just don't see on most devices today. It doesn't miss out on any of the extras either, and you get a charger in the box.</p><p>Best of all, the cameras are fantastic; the Hasselblad tuning makes a real difference, leading to photos with great dynamic range and color vibrancy. If anything, I like the OnePlus 13 to the OnePlus 15, and it's much better than the Galaxy S25 Ultra and every other Samsung phone.

It's a way to experience <em>full body</em> rumble from your games, music, movies, or anything else in your life that makes sound. Woojer's patented technology intelligently turns sound into haptic feedback, and it does so without mixing in the noises you don't want.</p><p>Assume you're playing an online game like Call of Duty or even a VR game like Forefront and want to feel the shooting and explosions, but not the voices of the other players. Woojer <em>already</em> automatically cancels out things like voices and music while gaming because it understands that gamers want to feel effects, not ambient music or other players' voices.</p><p>Conversely, if you're playing a game like Lumines Arise on your Steam Deck, the pumping bass of the music will perfectly vibrate into your <em>inner soul</em> thanks to the Woojer Vest 4. It's impressively immersive and brings a whole new dimension to all your entertainment. I use it every time I play a VR multiplayer game like Breachers or Forefront, but it's also excellent for non-VR games when you really want to get in on the action.</p><h2 id="how-does-a-haptic-vest-work-2">How does a haptic vest work?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="32CMByQaLeiora4S67tJQj" name="woojer-series-3-app-main-screen" alt="The Woojer app with a Woojer Haptic Vest 3 connected" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/32CMByQaLeiora4S67tJQj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Whether you're using a Woojer Vest 4, Woojer Body Strap, or one of Woojer's older products, they all work the same way. You load the Woojer app onto your smartphone and then turn on your Woojer vest. The app automatically connects to your Vest or Body Strap and gives you full control over the volume, haptic intensity, mode, and more.</p><p>From here, you'll either plug a pair of wired headphones into the Woojer unit or pair Bluetooth headphones <strong>to the Woojer</strong> via the app, matching the vibration perfectly in sync with the sound. Lastly, you'll plug your source into the Woojer unit — I most commonly connect my Meta Quest 3 or Steam Deck via the included 3.5mm audio cable — to feed sound into the Vest or Body Strap. You can also use Bluetooth to wirelessly stream your music to the vest.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="n8LAeNEzqvnq6ueWhS5Jd4" name="woojer-body-strap-4-with-steam-deck" alt="A Woojer Body Strap 4 next to a Steam Deck playing Lumines Arise" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n8LAeNEzqvnq6ueWhS5Jd4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>And that's it! There's no other configuration needed unless you want to select a specific mode or change settings in the Woojer app. It's impressively simple and is far easier than how older haptic vests and straps used to work. I enjoy this most for gaming, but they're also great for really feeling the beat in your music or turning an average at-home movie into a theater-like experience with full body rumble.</p><p>If a full vest is too much for you, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/woojer-hifi-haptic-body-strap-4-compatible-with-ps-345-xbox-series-x-one-360-nintendo-switch-3ds-black/J3R8WH8PC4/sku/6641955"><strong>Woojer Body Strap 4</strong></a> is also available for <strong>$30 off</strong> (pictured above next to the Steam Deck) and offers a single point of rumble that can be placed on your chest, stomach, back, or even your leg, if you prefer.</p><h2 id="more-cyber-monday-2025-quick-links-7">More Cyber Monday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Cyber Monday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Cyber Monday (so far)</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Cyber Monday (so far)</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Cyber Monday (so far)</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

It's called Adaptive Clock, and manages font size, orientation, and location based on your lock screen wallpaper. However, users have reported for months that Adaptive Clock hasn't been working as expected, as documented by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oneui/comments/1nv0z71/the_new_adaptive_clock_isnt_working/" target="_blank">Reddit posts and comments</a>.

It would add a premium offering to the existing Edge 70 lineup, which debuted in some regions earlier this month. Now, reliable leaker Evan Blass is reporting the Motorola Edge 70 Ultra will indeed be powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 chip, confirming an earlier rumor. This would put the Edge 70 Ultra behind flagship models like the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025, but ahead of the rest of the Edge 70 series.</p><p>It'll be the first non-folding "Ultra" model from Motorola in a few years, since the brand skipped an Edge 60 Ultra for the previous generation. In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/1993765192635945389" target="_blank">post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Evan Blass says the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chip will be inside of Motorola's unannounced flagship, codenamed "Urus." Blass adds that this model will be likely branded as the Motorola Edge 70 Ultra.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Qualcomm's just-announced Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 SoC is set to power Motorola's upcoming, non-foldable flagship, codenamed Urus and likely branded as Edge 70 Ultra.<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1993765192635945389">November 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>The leak comes mere days after Qualcomm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/snapdragon-8-gen-5-announced">officially announced the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 mobile platform</a>, which sits below the flagship Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 mobile platform. The lower-tier chip is still considered a flagship offering, built on TSMC's 3nm process node and packing solid AI and gaming performance. The chip could be paired with an Adreno 829 GPU and 16GB of memory in the Motorola Edge 70 Ultra.</p><h2 id="motorola-edge-70-ultra-rumors-point-to-snapdragon-8-gen-5-not-elite-2">Motorola Edge 70 Ultra rumors point to Snapdragon 8 Gen 5, not Elite</h2><p>This report from Blass confirms an earlier leak, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/leaked-benchmarks-detail-motorola-edge-70-ultra-snapdragon-8-gen-5">revealed the Chinese variant of the Edge 70 Ultra</a> in alleged benchmark results. That rumor claimed the phone's model number could be <strong>XT2603-1</strong>, and it was thought the phone could be branded the Moto X70 Ultra. Now, it's looking more like Motorola will go with the Motorola Edge 70 Ultra name.</p><p>The leaked benchmarks claim the Edge 70 Ultra scored 2,636 on single-core tests, while it earned 7,475 for multi-core performance. That's below what we've come to expect from Qualcomm's Elite-branded chips, but still impressive.</p><p>With Motorola's non-folding flagship allegedly opting for the lesser Snapdragon 8 Gen 5, the company's only phone to sport the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-confirms-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 processor</a> could be the Motorola Razr Ultra 2026.</p> ]]></dc:content>

I had over 75 phones delivered this year, and whether it's the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-is-the-most-exciting-phone-around">tri-folding Huawei Mate XT</a>, the incredibly-thin <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">OPPO Find N5</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-magic-v5-review">Honor Magic V5</a>, the vibrant <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-17-pro-review">iPhone 17 Pro</a> (I got the orange one), or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/oppo-find-x8-ultra-review">Find X8 Ultra</a> with its outstanding cameras, there have been plenty of standouts this year.</p><p>Most flagships started using silicon batteries, leading to devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/oppo-find-x9-pro-review">Find X9 Pro</a> and its 7,500mAh battery, and Vivo outdid itself with the cameras on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x300-pro-review">X300 Pro</a>. While these phones are limited to select global regions, there's a decent selection of phones to consider if you're in North America.</p><p>Google got its act together this year with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/with-the-pixel-10-pro-xl-google-finally-made-a-faultless-flagship">Pixel 10 Pro XL</a>, delivering a flagship that excels in all areas. The Pixel 9a, meanwhile, is the best budget phone around. And if you need an all-rounder that gets everything right, the OnePlus 13 is still my go-to recommendation. With Black Friday in the past and Cyber Monday set to roll out, now is the best time to buy a phone if you're looking to do so.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="7743feec-970a-42cc-aeca-0766f48f949b" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="The Pixel 9a is all the phone you need if you just want a budget device with great cameras.

With phone prices going up next year, this is the best time to get a new phone while they're still relatively affordable, and there are decent deals to be had. The Pixel 9a is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Gemini-Smartphone-Incredible/dp/B0DVHTT1GS">now selling at just $349</a>, and honestly, it's a terrific choice if you just need a reliable phone. It nails the basics, has a great in-hand feel, and the rear design is pretty great thanks to a camera module that sits flush with the body. The cameras are the best in this category, you get a clean software with fast updates, and there isn't much missing on this phone.</p><p>If you've used a Samsung phone and are considering switching over to another manufacturer, I highly recommend the OnePlus 13, which is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Smartphone-Snapdragon-SUPERVOOC-Hasselblad/dp/B0DP8KZLQ3">now down to $699</a>. It's significantly more affordable than the Galaxy S25 models, but you still get amazing cameras, better battery life than any Samsung phone, and a level of fluidity that One UI can't come close to.</p><p>And if you're ready to embrace AI features and want a phone that does the best job in this area, you should get the Pixel 10 Pro XL. The phone usually costs $1,199, but Google has a $300 discount right now, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Pro-Smartphone-Fast-Charging/dp/B0FFTSKP7M/">bringing it down to $899</a>. That's still quite a lot of cash, but the Pixel 10 Pro XL is the best Google phone yet, and having used every single Pixel in the last decade, I'm confident in recommending the device.</p> ]]></dc:content>

I'll get to the cases in a bit, but seeing as we're in the middle of deals season, it's worth pointing out that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nomadgoods.com/collections/iphone-17-cases">Nomad has a 20% sale</a> right now, making this the ideal time to get a case, smartwatch band, or any other accessory.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="79a400f8-53c4-4dee-82d2-41d6007bac66" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="The Modern Leather Case is one of the best leather cases you can get for the iPhone 17 Pro, and it comes in several styles and finishes." data-dimension48="The Modern Leather Case is one of the best leather cases you can get for the iPhone 17 Pro, and it comes in several styles and finishes." data-dimension25="$44" href="https://www.amazon.com/NOMAD-Leather-English-Compatible-Charging/dp/B0FP1PR4QX/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:754px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:198.94%;"><img id="mKPVpS4dgxmwdLYHMMURs5" name="Nomad iPhone 17 Pro Modern Leather Case" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mKPVpS4dgxmwdLYHMMURs5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="754" height="1500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>The Modern Leather Case is one of the best leather cases you can get for the iPhone 17 Pro, and it comes in several styles and finishes. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/NOMAD-Leather-English-Compatible-Charging/dp/B0FP1PR4QX/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="79a400f8-53c4-4dee-82d2-41d6007bac66" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="The Modern Leather Case is one of the best leather cases you can get for the iPhone 17 Pro, and it comes in several styles and finishes." data-dimension48="The Modern Leather Case is one of the best leather cases you can get for the iPhone 17 Pro, and it comes in several styles and finishes." data-dimension25="$44">View Deal</a></p></div><p>The Modern Leather Case is the one I used the most, and it is fantastic; it fits without any issues, and it provides much-needed protection to the iPhone 17 Pro without adding too much heft or bulk. The inside of the case has a lining to protect the rear of the iPhone 17 Pro while it's housed within, and all Nomad cases have neodymium magnets as standard, ensuring full MagSafe usability.</p><p>This variant of the case has a polycarbonate frame at the sides with a glass Camera Control button, and the power and volume buttons are made out of aluminum and have good tactility. I like the feel of the leather, and my cases came with Horween leather, which is exquisite. I also have a regular vegetable-tanned leather case, and while it also is great in-hand, the Horween models just feel better.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div

island, and it does just as good a job at the front, with the raised sides ensuring the panel doesn't take much damage should the phone take a tumble. If you want a full-leather design, the Traditional Leather Case extends the leather to the sides as well, and you can get this model with Horween leather as well.</p><p>The Rugged Leather Case kicks things up a notch, providing all-around protection that comes with a decent amount of bulk. Honestly, I don't think you need this case unless you want to be absolutely sure; the regular leather cases get 8ft tumble protection, while the rugged model pushes that to 15ft.</p><div

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>No one likes their stuff stolen, but thanks to brands like Apple and Google, keeping track of our belongings has become much easier with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-trackers">Bluetooth item trackers</a>. Personally, I use AirTags (and a Find Hub-compatible <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/motorola-moto-tag-hands-on-review">Moto Tag</a>) with my luggage whenever I travel, and I keep one in my backpack, my car, and my wallet.</p><p>It makes it easier to keep <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/find-my-device">track of devices</a> that don't support built-in tracking and gives me peace of mind. However, for something like a wallet that holds all my cards, ID, and cash, having an item tracker is even more important.</p><p>While a card-style tracker has been my go-to solution, I recently switched to a wallet from ESR that comes with Find My built in. So even if someone steals my wallet and throws out a card tracker, they can't remove the tracking hardware. And this Black Friday, it is down to its lowest price.</p><p>ESR's Geo Wallet with Find My built in has been my daily wallet for the past three months, and the company has made it more affordable this holiday season with a great discount. Right now, you can grab the ESR Geo Wallet on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F3XFTJKQ/"><strong>Amazon at 34% off</strong></a>, dropping the price from $50 to just $33.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="3d1dfc65-c08c-46b5-9a0d-facba87e4c10" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="ESR's Geo Wallet comes with Find My tracking built in, which means even if someone tries to remove your tracker, they won't be able to since it's embedded inside the wallet.

And while battery life is usually a concern with Find My trackers, and since this one is built into the wallet, ESR includes a cable in the box so you can recharge it easily.</p><p>ESR claims up to six months of use on a single charge, and I've drained roughly 50% in two months, so it may depend on your usage. You can also charge the wallet directly from your phone using the included cable.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="gi8d9J3ZopqiHKkcPtar4f" name="esr-geo-wallet-charging" alt="ESR Geo Wallet on charging" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gi8d9J3ZopqiHKkcPtar4f.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sanuj Bhatia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Moreover, it includes RFID-blocking to keep your data secure. The wallet also offers plenty of space, allowing you to store up to nine cards plus two ID cards side by side. It comes in black, brown, and a carbon-fiber finish, though I'm personally a fan of the black variant. Durability has been great so far with zero issues to the faux leather finish over the past few months.</p><p>The only downside, in my opinion, is that it's compatible only with iPhone and Apple devices since it supports only Find My, leaving Android users out. If you own an iPhone, though, it's more than good enough.</p><p>We've reached out to the company to ask whether a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/find-my-device-is-out-googles-new-find-hub-is-officially-in">Google Find My Device</a> version is coming, but until then, this makes for a great holiday-season gift.</p><h2 id="more-black-friday-2025-quick-links-2">More Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>major discounts on Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>official Black Friday discounts on tablets, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The Anker Nano Power Bank is incredibly useful for many reasons, but the main ones are the charging speed and built-in USB-C cable.</p><p>It supports 45W charging, which is faster than most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Galaxy phones</a> can charge, while still being quick enough for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> that support faster speeds. As for the USB-C cable, it's retractable, meaning it's hidden when you don't need it, and you just have to pull it out to extend it up to 2.3 feet. And if you want to charge multiple devices, the power bank also comes with a USB-C port and a USB-A port.</p><p>With a 10,000mAh capacity, it'll be able to provide a full charge to your smartphone and then some, or provide a decent charge to multiple devices.</p><p>There's a small display so you can monitor temperature as well as real-time charging speed, and it'll even give you an estimate of how much charge time you have remaining. And to help with portability, the power bank comes with a loop.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="JXpPtM67NfeQH4T9D86fcX" name="Anker-MagGo-Power-Bank-5K-hands-on-14" alt="The Anker MagGo Power Bank 5K on the Pixel 10" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JXpPtM67NfeQH4T9D86fcX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The MagGo Power Bank is a bit more niche, since it's a Qi2 wireless charger, but as more Android phones gain support for the standard, it's definitely a charger you'll want in your arsenal. It's surprisingly thin for a 5,000mAh power bank and supports 15W speeds (or 20W with the USB-C port). The magnets are great because you can stick them to the back of your phone and not have to worry about carrying it awkwardly.</p><p>And as a plus, it's also good for charging smaller devices like wireless earbuds.</p><h2 id="black-friday-2025-quick-links-12">Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Other models, like the Garmin Fenix 8 and Venu X1, are smarter and flashier. However, neither the Fenix 8 nor the Venu X1 can last as long as the Garmin Enduro 3. Even as I’ve dabbled with other smartwatches, I keep coming back the Enduro, and it’s still on-sale after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/black-friday">Black Friday</a> as we look ahead to Cyber Monday.</p><p>To truly appreciate how crazy it is that the Enduro 3 is only $750 for a limited time, you need a bit of backstory. Garmin loaded the Enduro 3 full of features, but shaved $200 off the retail price compared to the Enduro 2. So, the Garmin Enduro 3 is already a solid value at $900, but it’s way better when Amazon, Best Buy, and Target take another $150 off.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="94168ca0-7368-4bde-a113-cc54fd4e1c41" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Best Buy - $749.99" data-dimension48="Best Buy - $749.99" data-dimension25="$749.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-EnduroTM-Ultraperformance-Smartwatch-Built/dp/B0DD5N9G17" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="bbPXWV9bzZTtopndFG97Xn" name="Garmin Enduro 3" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bbPXWV9bzZTtopndFG97Xn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>The Garmin Enduro 3 packs the best Garmin sensors into a rugged shell offering up to 36 days of battery life on a single charge.

I use the state-of-the-art Garmin Elevate v5 heart rate sensor to track regular walking, running, and hiking workouts, plus the occasional sleep tracking session. Even with all of that GPS tracking, I consistently get at least three weeks of usage out of the Enduro 3. When the dreaded “low battery” notification comes in, I usually have <em>another week</em> to charge it.</p><p>I rotate a few other premium smartwatches in, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-review">Samsung Galaxy Watch 8</a> and the Apple Watch Ultra 3. But guess which watch I turn to when I forget to charge one of those models on a given night? The Garmin Enduro 3. I can take it on a work trip and <em>leave the charger at home</em>. This kind of battery will change your life as soon as you give it a try.</p><p>More recently, I’ve been loving all of Garmin’s third-party app integrations. The Garmin Connect platform gets a bit data-dense for me at times, but I have my Enduro 3 set up to automatically upload my workout data to Nike Run Club and Meta AI as well. So, I can use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oakley-meta-vanguard-smart-glasses-review">Autocapture with Garmin on my Oakley Meta Vanguard</a> sunglasses to track my runs and record live video thanks the Enduro 3. Plus, it’s all cross-platform, so I can pair my Garmin with iOS and Android as needed.</p><p>The Garmin Enduro 3 is a sleeper pick, especially with $150 off until this deal runs out. It might not be as sexy as the Fenix 8 or Venu X1, but it’s irreplaceable for me. If you’re tired of nightly (or weekly) charging and want the best Garmin tech, grab this Enduro 3 deal while you can.</p><h2 id="black-friday-2025-quick-links-17">Black Friday 2025 — quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><em><strong>Black Friday Samsung Galaxy deals</strong></em></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><em><strong>Black Friday Google Pixel deals</strong></em></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><em><strong>Black Friday Motorola deals</strong></em></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

We also like them for their superb battery life and their ease of use through the Sony Headphones Connect app, which has EQ and other controls. The earbuds also include an IPX4 water resistance rating, as well as fast charging through the USB-C cable and Qi wireless charging. They're definitely on the pricey side of the earbuds spectrum, making deals like this particularly worth taking advantage of.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$328.00" data-dimension48="$328.00" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/sony-wf1000xm5-true-wireless-noise-cancelling-earbuds-black/J7XSRH53VJ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:420px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="4ZY9knHp8ropTFjbbetNSb" name="sony-wf-1000XM5-leak-black.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4ZY9knHp8ropTFjbbetNSb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="420" height="420" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Sony WF-1000XM5 earbuds:</strong> <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/sony-wf1000xm5-true-wireless-noise-cancelling-earbuds-black/J7XSRH53VJ" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$328.00" data-dimension48="$328.00" data-dimension25=""><del>$328.00</del> <strong>$228 at Best Buy</strong></a></p><p>Sony's powerful WF-1000XM5 earbuds are currently selling for $80 off at Best Buy, as the retailer soft launches some early Black Friday discounts.

If the wall plug placement in your home is terrible, you can get a couple of these towers and strips to make those plugs easily accessible.</p><p>Instead of pushing the bed, couch, or table every time to plug and unplug an adapter, you can simply set up TESSAN's multiplugs or towers in strategic locations around your house. I like to keep the 11-outlet tower under my office table as I usually have a million devices plugged in. The flat strip is perfect for the bedroom as it can sit behind your bed or on your bedside table.</p><p>You don't even need to worry about overloading these extensions, as all of them come with surge protection and very high power ratings to begin with.</p><h2 id="black-friday-2025-quick-links-32">Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More post-Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

My fiancée also uses hers regularly, though her pair is in much better shape and should last a couple more years. In my case, I don't mind having to buy a new pair after nearly four years, considering the great price.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="ef1e54de-2a25-4435-b8f7-d7cc4b37a603" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="or: Sony ZX headphones with mic: $34.99" data-dimension48="or: Sony ZX headphones with mic: $34.99" data-dimension25="$12.99" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/sony-zx-series-wired-on-ear-headphones-black/J7XSRHW9LS" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="bMNAY36JsEYYZh9hjchkc5" name="sony-zx-wired-on-ear-headphones" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bMNAY36JsEYYZh9hjchkc5.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>or: Sony ZX headphones with mic: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OUX6U6G" data-dimension112="ef1e54de-2a25-4435-b8f7-d7cc4b37a603" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="or: Sony ZX headphones with mic: $34.99" data-dimension48="or: Sony ZX headphones with mic: $34.99" data-dimension25="$12.99"><del>$34.99</del><strong> $19.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>These 3.5mm headphones have a 12 Hz–22 kHz frequency created with 1.38-inch neodymium dynamic drivers. They're on-ear, rather than over-ear, which minimizes passive noise cancellation; you might see this as a negative, but I prefer on-ear so that they don't get sweaty or feel constricting for eight-hour days, and I can hear when someone in the room is speaking to me. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/sony-zx-series-wired-on-ear-headphones-black/J7XSRHW9LS" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="ef1e54de-2a25-4435-b8f7-d7cc4b37a603" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="or: Sony ZX headphones with mic: $34.99" data-dimension48="or: Sony ZX headphones with mic: $34.99" data-dimension25="$12.99">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You want reliable audio quality for your workday playlist, a lightweight fit that won't feel uncomfortable by 5 p.m. or press into your glasses arms, and a low price that saves your tech budget for wireless earbuds instead.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You need either active or passive noise cancellation, or you're the kind of audiophile who needs more advanced drivers from flagship headphones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/sony-wh-1000xm6-review">Sony WH-1000XM6</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bose-qc-ultra-headphones-review">Bose QuietComfort Ultra</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="bgQAzmtBMTr8qbrQstyr9o" name="Sony-ZX-headphones-new-vs-old" alt="Two pairs of Sony ZX wired on-ear headphones sitting on a blanket, the closer pair notably worn down compared to the other." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bgQAzmtBMTr8qbrQstyr9o.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">My pair has seen some wear-and-tear </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'm <em>not</em> an expert on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">best wireless headphones</a>; most of my colleagues' picks are on sale for Black Friday if you're willing to spend hundreds more.

It makes a difference!</p><p>The Sony ZX series is quite popular, with hundreds of thousands of solid reviews on Amazon and Best Buy combined, because of its simple quality and affordability paired with a household name. This Black Friday deal price isn't the lowest ever; it's fallen as low as $9.99 before. But don't fall into the Black Friday deal trap trying to "save" as much money as possible; $13 for headphones that'll last for years is great.</p><p>Personally, I prefer the ZXs with the mic, which captures perfectly clear sound for my colleagues on remote calls or teammates during multiplayer Baldur's Gate sessions. But it's up to you whether you want to save a few more bucks or not! Either way, I'm off to buy a new pair for myself.</p><h2 id="more-black-friday-deals-quick-links-2">More Black Friday deals - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

But by a stroke of luck, I happened to see this deal from Walmart, which was the last place I expected to have the best tablet deal.</p><p>When there aren't a bunch of Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals going on, the Galaxy Tab S10 FE+ is actually a difficult recommendation. It's not because of the features or functionality, but it all comes down to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Processor-Note-Taking-Manufacturer-Warranty/dp/B0DVZWJL91">$649 retail price</a>.</p><p>For just $150 more, you can get the Galaxy Tab S11, which is equipped with a better screen and newer processor. Now the question becomes whether you should get the $409 Tab S10 FE+ or splurge on the Galaxy Tab S11, which is down to $649.</p><p>Honestly, if the Tab S11 were a bit cheaper, it would make for a more difficult decision. But I'd probably still go with the Tab S10 FE+, as it lets you keep some money to splurge on dinner with, or to pick up some of the other Black Friday/Cyber Monday deals you come across.</p><h2 id="black-friday-2025-quick-links-37">Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

For the last several years, phones like the Galaxy Z Flip and Motorola Razr have become more commonplace in a sea of flat slabs. But while flip phones sell by the millions each year, there are still a ton of people who are wary of foldable phones or question the purpose of flip phones.</p><p>I've used Motorola Razr (and some Galaxy Z Flip) phones for the past few years, and while I'm always stopped by people who express how cool the phones are, I've also met with some apprehension. Much of this is usually focused on durability, while some are simply disappointed that it's not an iPhone.</p><p>So why should you consider a flip phone as your next smartphone purchase?

Larger foldables like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-review">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a> maintain a normal smartphone size and expand out to something akin to a small tablet. However, a flip phone starts at a normal smartphone size and shrinks to roughly half that when closed.</p><p>Android Central's Jerry Hildenbrand loves this about his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2024-review">Razr 2024</a>, and Nick Sutrich's wife also enjoys how the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus 2024</a> can easily fit in any purse or pocket. Motorola and Samsung have also leaned in on this a bit with accessories like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/best-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-cases">ring stand cases for the Galaxy Z Flip</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/best-motorola-razr-ultra-2025-cases">crossbody cases/straps for the Motorola Razr</a>.</p><p>The only downside is that folding it in half essentially doubles the phone's thickness, so it may protrude more from your pocket. Fortunately, phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-review">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> are addressing this with noticeably thinner bodies.</p><h2 id="cover-screen-2">Cover screen</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FQksa84sZxrpW44LYMSQdB" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-review-09" alt="Apps on the Razr Ultra 2025 cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FQksa84sZxrpW44LYMSQdB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For me, the cover screen is probably my favorite part about using a flip phone like the excellent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Razr Ultra 2025</a>.

Just select the apps you want to access on the cover screen, arrange them how you want, and you're good to go.</p><p>The process <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/first-things-to-do-with-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">takes a bit more setup on the Galaxy Z Flip 7</a>, but you can still use your apps on the cover screen.</p><p>Scaling isn't always perfect, but for me, this is a great way to use apps more inconspicuously than if they filled your entire main screen, which is better for privacy in public spaces.</p><h2 id="camera-tricks-2">Camera tricks</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6aTDczcyarJiJsTPp6Tfde" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-review-07.jpg" alt="The Motorola Razr Plus 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6aTDczcyarJiJsTPp6Tfde.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This goes hand in hand with why I love the cover screen, but there's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-flip-phones-my-favorite-camera-tricks">more you can do with a flip phone camera</a> than with a regular smartphone. It's easy to take high-quality selfies with the primary camera because you can use the cover screen as a viewfinder. Furthermore, if you're taking a photo of someone else, you can show a preview of the viewfinder on the cover screen so they can see themselves before you take a photo. People <em>love </em>this feature (I know I do).</p><p>The flip phone's design lets you ditch the tripod for group shots. Just set the phone down and angle the hinge with the camera and cover screen viewfinder enabled. This makes it easy to capture hands-free photos and videos, making it great for TikTok videos, too!</p><p>Finally, Motorola and Samsung flip phones come with an Auto Camcorder feature that transforms your phone into a mini camcorder. Fold the phone at a 90-degree angle, and the camera UI transforms so you can hold it like you would a camcorder and capture smoother video. It's really quite neat and makes you feel a bit like a filmmaker.</p><h2 id="they-re-actually-durable-2">They're actually durable</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GUVnpZPGvaat87e8gQej6Q" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-7-Review-10" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GUVnpZPGvaat87e8gQej6Q.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>People are justifiably concerned about the longevity of foldable phones. After all, it's a <em>folding piece of glass</em>. In the early days, we saw plenty of examples of foldables cracking, failing, and ultimately proving why most consumers should shy away from these devices until companies made them more durable and reliable.</p><p>Fortunately, in the year of our lord 2025, foldables are much more durable than they used to be. Most foldables have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/is-the-motorola-razr-2025-waterproof">high water resistance rating</a>, meaning they can be submerged without issue. Newer foldables even have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-waterproof">dust resistance</a>, so you shouldn't have to worry as much about small particles messing up the internals (like the hinge).</p><p>Furthermore, the glass and folding mechanisms have also improved. The display crease is much less noticeable, and displays have been tested to withstand more than 400,000 folds without faltering, which should result in years of use.</p><h2 id="the-pure-nostalgia-2">The pure nostalgia</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1199px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.21%;"><img id="x4XvN8hvUfuuZneM8R7sHP" name="Moto-Razr-Plus-2024-Paris-Edition" alt="Moto Razr Paris Edition" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/x4XvN8hvUfuuZneM8R7sHP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1199" height="674" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you're a millennial like me, then you should fully remember the days of the original Razr.

According to their discovery, Gemini is supposedly preparing a new "annotation" feature for images that users prompt it to generate. Annotations seem to extend beyond just typing on your digital keyboard, as it seems users can "draw and add text to generated images," per the tipster.</p><p>The tipster provided a snapshot of this alleged feature, showing how Gemini will offer a horizontal color palette. More importantly, there are two options beneath it: a squiggly line for drawing and a classic "T" for text.</p><p>Curiously, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/DarrenTjan/status/1993828007962980498?s=20">another user</a> chimed in, who also seemingly discovered this in-the-works feature, claiming that users can soon "resubmit" those annotated images. The user states, "I'm currently downloading the image, circling, arrowing, and putting text instructions before resubmitting with a prompt." So, instead of writing out your prompt again, after Gemini failed to generate what you'd like, users <em>might </em>be able to draw/write those specific changes on the image.</p><p>This sounds like a rather easy way of directly impacting how the AI behaves when you're looking for those minute aspects to change. Currently, there's no word on when we could see this feature arrive in the Gemini app.</p><h2 id="mark-it-up-make-the-change-2">Mark it up, make the change</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Google is working on an image annotation feature for Gemini.

"Generate me a coloring page" 🍌 pic.twitter.com/mknesNVwrp<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1993824547926052911">November 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>Google has been implementing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/geminis-built-in-ai-image-editor-is-here-to-mess-with-your-photos-directly">methods for image editing</a> in Gemini natively since earlier this year. The editor works for those generated by AI and photos taken by users themselves. Google stated that users could change backgrounds, add or remove objects, and blend photos using the AI's capabilities. Users could also tell Gemini a story and have the AI try and match that with its AI visuals.</p><p>What's been rumored now brings that human element in a little more, by enabling users to directly engage with the AI's results, instead of starting from zero again.</p><p>Gemini's image capabilities were recently extended, as Google revealed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/nano-banana-goes-pro-with-refined-design-consistency-and-accuracy-in-the-gemini-app">Nano Banana Pro</a>. During its announcement, Google said the model was capable of generating "more accurate and content-rich images for users." Additionally, Nano Banana Pro clears up its legibility for text, fonts, and more. In a way, perhaps this is in preparation for this annotation feature, but we'll have to wait and see.</p> ]]></dc:content>

All these new phones are uncomfortable to hold and ugly to look at, but a skin and a case from Dbrand fixes most of that in just a few seconds. Thankfully, Dbrand <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://dbrand.com/black-friday"><strong>is slashing 40% off</strong></a> its normal prices during its post-Black Friday sale, meaning you have exactly 2 days to get a clue and get something from Dbrand.</p><p>To sweeten the deal, Dbrand is tossing in a free set of edgy Dbrand playing cards and dropping in free shipping for orders over $65. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://dbrand.com/black-friday/grip/google-pixel-10-pro-xl-cases?addons=prism&design=tmnp">My personal favorite is the TMNP</a> (Teenage Mutant Ninja Pixel) style, which turns Pixel phones into a bona fide Ninja Turtle, complete with grippy sides and a pristine Prism glass screen protector on the front. It fixes all my problems with Google's annoying design, and it looks great doing it!</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="8ced8837-c621-4c9a-8672-0c078925cfed" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Dbrand cases, skins, and screen protectors at 40% off" data-dimension48="Dbrand cases, skins, and screen protectors at 40% off" href="https://dbrand.com/black-friday" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:802px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="uDKRZLrTnVsLNo6uYhEDXE" name="Dbrand Google Pixel 10 Skin" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uDKRZLrTnVsLNo6uYhEDXE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="802" height="802" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><a href="https://dbrand.com/black-friday" data-dimension112="8ced8837-c621-4c9a-8672-0c078925cfed" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Dbrand cases, skins, and screen protectors at 40% off" data-dimension48="Dbrand cases, skins, and screen protectors at 40% off" data-dimension25=""><strong>Dbrand cases, skins, and screen protectors at 40% off</strong></a></p><p>Dbrand has an extraordinarily wide range of cases, screen protectors, and its famous line of skins on sale for 40% off during Black Friday/Cyber Monday weekend, letting you reskin your ugly phone and add much-needed grip to its awful flat design.</p><p><strong>Price comparison: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/dbrand-ghost-case-with-pixelsnap-for-google-pixel-10-pro-xl-clear/J89GJY73C2">Best Buy - $45 ($5 off)</a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://dbrand.com/black-friday" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="8ced8837-c621-4c9a-8672-0c078925cfed" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Dbrand cases, skins, and screen protectors at 40% off" data-dimension48="Dbrand cases, skins, and screen protectors at 40% off" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You're like me and can't stand phones with flat, slippery sides that are hard to pick up and uncomfortable to hold, or if you think modern "clean" design is ugly and needs to look more interesting. You could also just get a skin or a screen protector and skip the case altogether.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You've got terrible taste in phones and think your naked Pixel 10 or Galaxy S25 somehow looks good.</p><p>I'm a big fan of Dbrand's products, and the company's famously flippant attitude is a great comic relief in an age where everyone is too dang serious, and everything is too dang expensive.</p><p>Slapping a skin on your phone not only makes it look great, but it also adds grippiness that modern metal-and-glass sandwiches simply don't have. If you want more protection, Dbrand makes Grip cases that are compatible with the company's skins, giving you the best of both worlds. Plus, the Prism line of screen protectors is obnoxiously easy to install and is, as Dbrand proudly claims, "idiot proof."</p><p>Dbrand's famous line of Killswitch cases <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://dbrand.com/black-friday/killswitch/nintendo-switch-2-cases"><strong>are also $45 off</strong></a>, and as they're my favorite Nintendo Switch 2 cases of all time, I can heartily recommend picking it up and fixing the ergonomic mess Nintendo created with its latest console.

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>We've entered that weird liminal space between <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/black-friday">Black Friday</a> and Cyber Monday sales, but if you're looking to grab a great tablet deal, it doesn't matter what you call it. Many of the best Android tablets we've ever used are still on sale following the main event last night, and I'm recommending three of my favorite picks below.</p><p>First off, when shopping for your discounted couch companion, it's important to ask yourself two quick questions: what will you use the tablet for, and how much can you spend? Do you need something bright and spacious for streaming movies and TV shows, or do you just need something simple and affordable to take on a road trip? No two <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablets</a> are made alike, so let's dive into my favorite Black Friday tablet deals of the season.</p><h2 id="three-of-the-web-s-best-tablet-deals-heading-into-cyber-monday-2">Three of the web's best tablet deals heading into Cyber Monday</h2><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="3eb4dca3-9cbd-4e41-8d91-7a4daa018a20" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$699.99" data-dimension48="$699.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FC2HCN1Q" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="WRmWzCVw8FpQoZ6ANfiRY5" name="oneplus-pad-3-with-keyboard-square-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WRmWzCVw8FpQoZ6ANfiRY5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>OnePlus Pad 3 256GB:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FC2HCN1Q" data-dimension112="3eb4dca3-9cbd-4e41-8d91-7a4daa018a20" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$699.99" data-dimension48="$699.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$699.99</del><strong> $579.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>It's no secret that we're huge fans of the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-3-review">OnePlus Pad 3</a>.

Most retailers have simply extended their Black Friday sales through the weekend and into Cyber Monday, so it's unlikely we'll see many <em>new </em>deals over the next few days. What you see is what you get, and you also run the risk of items selling out if you wait too long.</p><h2 id="where-can-i-find-the-best-black-friday-tablet-deals-2">Where can I find the best Black Friday tablet deals?</h2><p>Although I hate to recommend just one place, it seems like Amazon has been leading the charge with Black Friday tablet deals this year. That said, it never hurts to check sites like Best Buy and Walmart to see what they're offering, and I always visit the manufacturer's website itself before I hit that Buy Now button, just in case. If you're unsure about the quality of a deal, you can also use sites like <strong>Camelcamelcamel.com</strong> to check Amazon price history. </p><h2 id="what-is-the-best-android-tablet-2">What is the best Android tablet?</h2><p>Here at Android Central, we have decades of collective experience testing and reviewing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">best Android tablets</a> ever built. This year, Andrew Myrick, our senior editor with the most experience in the tablet space, has chosen the OnePlus Pad 3 is the best overall tablet that money can buy. It may not be the most powerful device ever built, but its price-to-performance ratio is unmatched and the build quality is a stunner. It also doesn't hurt that the Pad 3 comes with 12GB of RAM and is powered by the legendary Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset. </p><h2 id="more-black-friday-2025-quick-links-22">More Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Just two and a half years later, that same brilliant bundle <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Horizon-MountainTM-Bundle-PSVR2-5/dp/B0C1Q9X8VH/"><strong>is now down to $299</strong></a>, making it an irresistible addition to any PS5 gamer's setup.</p><p>This bundle includes the PSVR 2 headset, two controllers, and a copy of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/horizon-call-of-the-mountain">Horizon Call of the Mountain</a>. It's easily my favorite game in the Horizon Zero Dawn series, and it's one of the most beautiful VR games ever created. That's particularly excellent since it's included <em>free</em> in the box.</p><p>PSVR 2 requires a PS5 to play, but since nearly 100 million people already own one, you're likely set to enjoy one of the finest VR headsets to date without much fuss. So long as you've got that PS5, everything else you'll need is in this box. The PSVR 2 has hundreds of games to play, including big names like Resident Evil 7 and 8, Gran Turismo, Hitman World of Assassination, and many more titles you're going to love.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="3a4b1e91-5f80-4c90-9ff7-d1aa2754ed13" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$399" data-dimension48="$399" href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Horizon-MountainTM-Bundle-PSVR2-5/dp/B0C1Q9X8VH/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:900px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="8dix2b7u4Ehyhs3DVu9Q7P" name="psvr-2-horizon-cotm-bundle-official-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8dix2b7u4Ehyhs3DVu9Q7P.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="900" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>PlayStation VR2 Horizon COTM bundle:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Horizon-MountainTM-Bundle-PSVR2-5/dp/B0C1Q9X8VH/" data-dimension112="3a4b1e91-5f80-4c90-9ff7-d1aa2754ed13" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$399" data-dimension48="$399" data-dimension25=""><del>$399</del> <strong>$299 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>Unlock the power of your PS5 with the PSVR 2 and jump INTO your games.

Sony's edge is in its top-tier components, which include an OLED display, eye tracking, and advanced haptic feedback in both the controllers and headset.</p><p>Plus, there are a handful of exclusive games you can only get on the PSVR 2. Aside from the Sony-related IPs you might expect (like Horizon and Gran Turismo), the PSVR 2 features games with better graphics than the Meta Quest 3 can offer since it's powered by the PS5. Some exclusive titles, like Synapse, even use the PSVR 2's eye tracking to great effect, giving you kinetic powers that you can aim with just your eyes. It's unreal!</p><p>But there's no denying how good the Meta Quest 3S is, all at an even cheaper $199. To make that deal even sweeter, you don't need another console or PC to power a Meta Quest: it's a completely standalone VR console that doesn't use wires or limit your play space, and it has <em>even more</em> exclusive games than the PSVR 2.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="78af7b33-0407-4f27-b31a-dd812ab00362" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$299" data-dimension48="$299" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/meta-quest-3s-128gb-the-walking-dead-saints-sinners-bundle-dive-into-virtual-reality-white/J3LHRV8HL7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:816px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.12%;"><img id="vWNeMgNGUQRYB5p3BxhFSE" name="meta-quest-3s-w-walking-dead-render.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vWNeMgNGUQRYB5p3BxhFSE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="816" height="817" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Meta Quest 3S 128GB:</strong> <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/meta-quest-3s-128gb-the-walking-dead-saints-sinners-bundle-dive-into-virtual-reality-white/J3LHRV8HL7" data-dimension112="78af7b33-0407-4f27-b31a-dd812ab00362" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$299" data-dimension48="$299" data-dimension25=""><del>$299</del> <strong>$249, plus $50 gift card, free game, and more at Best Buy</strong></a></p><p>The Meta Quest 3S is currently on sale via multiple retailers for Black Friday, but Best Buy is one-upping the competition by throwing a $50 gift card into the mix.

The PSVR 2 only has black & white passthrough vision, which means no mixed reality content to be had.</p><p>Either route you choose, though, VR gamers are eating good this year, and with steep $100 off discounts for each of these headsets, it's the perfect year to finally jump into next-generation immersive gaming!</p><h2 id="black-friday-and-cyber-monday-2025-quick-links-7">Black Friday and Cyber Monday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More post-Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

However, one smartwatch that manages to nail everything is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch/oneplus-watch-3-43mm-hands-on">OnePlus Watch 3</a>.</p><p>The OnePlus Watch 3 easily delivers up to 5 days of battery life, has a solid mix of health and workout tracking features, and thanks to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/wear-os/wear-os-is-ditching-its-old-look-for-a-flashy-material-3-expressive-makeover">Wear OS</a>, supports all Android apps. And while we recommended buying this smartwatch even at its original $350 launch price in the U.S., this Black Friday deal makes it almost unmissable as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DYQ1QKF3/"><strong>Amazon is offering $100 off</strong></a> the OnePlus Watch 3.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="3c430f8f-f5e3-4928-b0c5-cfcf23b3297f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="The OnePlus Watch 3 is one of the most complete Wear OS smartwatches around, and at this Black Friday price, it's almost unbeatable since it brings everything you need from a smartwatch without burning a hole in your pocket." data-dimension48="The OnePlus Watch 3 is one of the most complete Wear OS smartwatches around, and at this Black Friday price, it's almost unbeatable since it brings everything you need from a smartwatch without burning a hole in your pocket." data-dimension25="$249.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DYQ1QKF3/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="PJbZoTraBTFQuxyV6DPDFi" name="OnePlus-Watch-3-green-and-black-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PJbZoTraBTFQuxyV6DPDFi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="3000" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>The OnePlus Watch 3 is one of the most complete Wear OS smartwatches around, and at this Black Friday price, it's almost unbeatable since it brings everything you need from a smartwatch without burning a hole in your pocket. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DYQ1QKF3/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="3c430f8f-f5e3-4928-b0c5-cfcf23b3297f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="The OnePlus Watch 3 is one of the most complete Wear OS smartwatches around, and at this Black Friday price, it's almost unbeatable since it brings everything you need from a smartwatch without burning a hole in your pocket." data-dimension48="The OnePlus Watch 3 is one of the most complete Wear OS smartwatches around, and at this Black Friday price, it's almost unbeatable since it brings everything you need from a smartwatch without burning a hole in your pocket." data-dimension25="$249.99">View Deal</a></p></div><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-amazon-deals-2025"><em><strong>The best 25 deals for Android users during Amazon's Black Friday sale</strong></em></a></li></ul><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You want a smartwatch with days-long battery life, solid health tracking, and a bright AMOLED display with great Wear OS app support.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You prefer a slim, lightweight watch and expect long-term software support.</p><p>OnePlus has been making smartwatches for a few years now, and the OnePlus Watch 3 is as good as it gets. It offers a large AMOLED display that's easily visible outdoors, whether you're running to work or hiking. The Watch's screen remains bright and readable in almost every situation.</p><p>However, the most impressive thing about this smartwatch isn't Wear OS, its build and design, or even the display. It's the battery life. Android Central reviewer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/author/nicholas-sutrich">Nicholas Sutrich</a> couldn't kill the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-review#section-oneplus-watch-3-what-you-ll-love">OnePlus Watch 3</a> in more than four days with all features on, including Always-On Display.</p><p>This is the level of endurance you usually see only on dedicated running watches like Garmin or Coros, but here you get that benefit on a Wear OS smartwatch too. For comparison, this is better battery life than what you'd get on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-review">Samsung Galaxy Watch 8</a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/google-pixel-watch-4-hands-on">Pixel Watch 4</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="c4Z2Qxc2HNYK7fALtXxBQC" name="oneplus-watch-3-battery-modes" alt="The two battery modes of the OnePlus Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/c4Z2Qxc2HNYK7fALtXxBQC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Long battery life doesn't mean fewer features either. The OnePlus Watch 3 offers a similar set of health-tracking features to other Wear OS watches, along with a physical rotating crown that makes navigating Wear OS easier without touching the screen much.</p><p>Of course, there are a few drawbacks as well, such as a bulkier build than some competitors, no LTE variant, and the fact that OnePlus will only provide two years of OS updates for the Watch 3. That said, at this price, it's all forgivable.</p><p>Bottom line, if you prefer a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS smartwatch</a> experience but still want the battery life of a non-Wear OS watch, the OnePlus Watch 3 is easily one of the best options you can buy this Black Friday.</p><h2 id="more-black-friday-2025-quick-links-27">More Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>major discounts on Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>official Black Friday discounts on tablets, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

While every major retailer has the Galaxy Ring on sale for the same price today, Best Buy is the best place to go because most of them offer sizing right in-store, making it easy to grab a Ring <em>today</em> instead of having to wait for a sizing kit to ship to your door.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="177e8b57-98b9-468f-8d5f-5a1eb7e4b6fb" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy Ring: $399" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy Ring: $399" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/samsung-galaxy-ring-size-before-you-buy-size-12-titanium-black-2024/J3ZYG2ZJ8F" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1631px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="PjGYwYg2vgeMwknCtD4Qab" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Ring-official-render-titanium-black.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PjGYwYg2vgeMwknCtD4Qab.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1631" height="1631" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy Ring: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/samsung-galaxy-ring-size-before-you-buy-size-12-titanium-black-2024/J3ZYG2ZJ8F" data-dimension112="177e8b57-98b9-468f-8d5f-5a1eb7e4b6fb" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy Ring: $399" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy Ring: $399" data-dimension25=""><del>$399</del> <strong>$279 at Best Buy</strong></a></p><p>At full price, the Samsung Galaxy Ring is simply an overpriced smart ring.

The Galaxy Ring is great for basic heart rate and step monitoring, but doesn't accurately offer advanced features like SpO2.</p><p>It's no secret that I strongly disliked the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Samsung Galaxy Ring</a> at launch. The Ring was overpriced and did very little considering that, but $279 changes the conversation quite a bit. If you're anything like me and don't like wearing watches throughout the day (or night), a smart ring like this could be the thing you're looking for.</p><p>As a whole, the Galaxy Ring is generally good at three things: 24/7 heart rate monitoring, step tracking, and sleep cycle tracking. Its 7-day battery life also means you can plop it on the charger at the end of the weekend and not have to think about it for the rest of the week.</p><p>The Galaxy Ring is <em>not</em> good at basically anything else. Don't expect it to give you advanced health metrics like SpO2, VO2 max, or function as a workout tracker. For that, you really just need to stick with a smartwatch or fitness band. If that sounds good to you, you won't find a better deal this year (or mayb ever) on this ring.</p><h2 id="black-friday-2025-quick-links-47">Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More post-Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

And while I liked it, I didn’t <em>LOVE</em> my experience. For starters, I had the basic 2022 Kindle. Super compact and easy to read on, my experience was dulled because I was using a device that was slightly older but at the same time was in black and white. I wanted to upgrade my device to a color model and was really going back and forth between the Libra and the Kindle Colorsoft. But I can’t begin to tell you how many people kept raving about the Kobo.</p><p>So I bit the bullet, bought the Kobo, was able to transfer my books over (which took a hot minute, but I figured it out), and I can officially say it’s going to be very hard to convince me to go back to a Kindle.</p><p>The Kobo is incredibly ergonomically designed for your comfort. With raised buttons on the side, you can actually hold it comfortably and turn the pages without it feeling awkward. I’ve read two books on my Kobo now, and both have been the most wonderful experiences. I get giddy every time I see the colored book covers on my e-reader, and whenever I highlight something, it’s so exciting to see different highlighter variants.</p><p>I haven’t gotten a stylus yet, but I think that’s going to be my next purchase.</p><p>Ultimately, my decision to switch to a Kobo has resulted in a much more comfortable experience. I get excited every time I pick up my device, and while I’ll never become an exclusive e-reader (I absolutely love my physical copy books!), I think this has just changed the game for me.</p><p>On a more notable point, the Kobo <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/libby-library-app-for-e-readers"><u>directly connects to the Libby app</u></a>, which allows you to easily borrow books from the library!</p><p>Anyway, listen, don’t make me try to convince you more. The Kobo Libra Colour is one of the best purchases I’ve ever made, and I guarantee that if you get it, you’re going to have an unputdownable experience reading your books.</p><h2 id="more-black-friday-2025-quick-links-32">More Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Our three <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">highest-rated smart glasses</a> are <em>all</em> on sale even after Black Friday is over, and the RayNeo Air 3s Pro are <em>even cheaper</em> now than they were just yesterday, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/RayNeo-Air-Pro-Glasses-SteamDeck/dp/B0FJRXSNWK/"><strong>down to an impressive $234</strong></a>.</p><p>All three pairs of glasses provide you with a massive wearable OLED display in a svelte glasses form factor, allowing you to plug them into your smartphone, Steam Deck, laptop, or several other devices. That gives you a personal, private screen that won't hurt your neck. Whether you're looking for the best image quality, lowest price, or widest range of compatible products, I'm here to help you make the right choice <em>today</em>.</p><h2 id="best-overall-smart-display-glasses-2">Best overall smart display glasses</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="3nxasAyAZkfzTZarDYJVYP" name="xreal-one-side-angle-lenses-01" alt="A pair of Xreal One smart glasses on a wooden tea tray" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3nxasAyAZkfzTZarDYJVYP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Xreal One has been our top choice since it launched earlier this year. My <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-one-review">Xreal One review</a> will help you understand what makes it the best if you want all the details, but the skinny is that Xreal One glasses come with the industry's first-ever dedicated chipset, allowing it to do things no other pair of glasses can. They're also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F7R96TFC"><strong>down to $399</strong></a>, the lowest price we've seen yet; a full $100 off!</p><p>Paramount to that experience is the ability to "mount" the virtual screen to an imaginary wall in front of you. When you plug Xreal One into any compatible device, the virtual screen in front of you stays in place just as a physical TV or monitor would, so you can move your head or body around normally, and that monitor will stay in place.</p><p>All other smart glasses "pin" the display to your face, which means that even the slightest jitter will make that display jostle and shake, and could give some people sore eyes or motion sickness. Xreal One's powerful chipset keeps this from happening, and the glasses even feature a built-in monitor-like settings menu that lets you fine-tune the image and several other options. Again, something no other pair of smart glasses can do.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="bd6374aa-83a8-4a19-9b76-3d041fe5ce2f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Take $100 off the normal price and enjoy the power of Xreal One with its dedicated, industry-first X1 chipset.

Typically, Samsung's device colors offer their distinct coloring on the back panel, leaving the frame with a lighter, almost metal hue. What Ice Universe suggests is that Samsung will change its darkest hue by wrapping the coloring over its edges, especially around its display.</p><p>The tipster states, "This time, the Galaxy S26 Ultra black version features a black frame." However, it seems consumers might be in for a slight visual anomaly if this happens.</p><p>The post on X states, "overall visual bezel is inevitably wider," because of the black edges around the display. The bezels are the black border around a display, a distinct marker that separates the display from its edges. If that <em>and </em>the frame is black, it might give the illusion that the S26 Ultr has massive bezels, when that (might not) be the case.</p><p>User comments on X have gone separate ways, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/emn_mora/status/1994011013981548727?s=20">some users praising</a> this potential, while others claim we're <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/joemama_0609/status/1993877598196388200?s=20">headed for scratch central</a>. Another tipster, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/theonecid/status/1993865319237210232?s=20">theonecid</a>, chimed in with a mock-up rendering of what a true Jet Black Galaxy S26 Ultra could look like. The frame is a little glossy, not quite as matte as what the series currently offers.

It's currently rumored that the S26 Ultra may adopt a more Galaxy Z Fold 7-style approach by adding that little island beneath its vertically lined cameras. This would, as you'd expect, give a bit of a camera bump, which the S25 Ultra lacks, aside from the camera protrusions.</p><p>Everything else, such as button placements, remains relatively the same in those leaks.</p><p>A more recent whispering from November claims that the S26 Ultra may <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s26-ultras-new-design-could-change-how-selfies-are-taken">change how users take selfies</a>. The selfie camera itself isn't rumored to change (big surprise), but what is potentially changing is the size of the lens cutout. Rumors claim the size could increase to 4mm, meaning users could have a slightly wider FOV (field of view) for their selfies.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This 11-inch TCL tablet is equipped with the latest-generation NXTPAPER 4.0 tech, and it's still somehow <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FLJMFNR7"><strong>$130 off</strong></a> even after Black Friday ended. Not only that, but the $239 price includes the tablet, a folio case, AND a stylus that's perfect for writing or note-taking. It's everything you need for an outrageously low price! If you're looking for Black Friday tablet deals, this is the best answer.</p><p>The tablet itself normally retails for $249, so you know you're getting a really good deal at $239 when it comes with that case and stylus. The tablet itself is no slouch either, and I covered the merits of its display in my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/tcl-nxtpaper-4-fixes-one-of-the-technologys-biggest-hidden-issues">TCL NXTPAPER 11 Plus display review</a> back in July. It was a great way to introduce the latest NXTPAPER 4.0 tech to the world, and it continues to be an excellent budget-friendly tablet that doesn't feel slow or lacking.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="fa3556e2-3dda-4763-a8e7-a20e8f40fae5" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Price comparison: Walmart - $224 (no case or stylus included)" data-dimension48="Price comparison: Walmart - $224 (no case or stylus included)" data-dimension25="$239.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FLJMFNR7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="zcr4Z8qwujAeqMm5gfzGGn" name="tcl-nxtpaper-11-plus-official-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zcr4Z8qwujAeqMm5gfzGGn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="1600" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>The TCL NXTPAPER 11 Plus tablet is equipped with a next-generation 120Hz NXTPAPER 4.0 display, 8GB RAM, 8000mAh battery, 256GB storage, <strong>and even comes with a case and a stylus</strong>, all for just $239.99 after Black Friday!</p><p><strong>Price comparison: </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/TCL-NXTPAPER-11-Plus/14687819013" data-dimension112="fa3556e2-3dda-4763-a8e7-a20e8f40fae5" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Price comparison: Walmart - $224 (no case or stylus included)" data-dimension48="Price comparison: Walmart - $224 (no case or stylus included)" data-dimension25="$239.99">Walmart - $224 (no case or stylus included)</a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FLJMFNR7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="fa3556e2-3dda-4763-a8e7-a20e8f40fae5" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Price comparison: Walmart - $224 (no case or stylus included)" data-dimension48="Price comparison: Walmart - $224 (no case or stylus included)" data-dimension25="$239.99">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You love to read a mix of books, manga, graphic novels, or other content, enjoy watching movies and TV shows on the go, or just need a tablet that feels great to write and draw on and won't bleed your eyes dry with a flickering display like Samsung tablets will.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You like to read outdoors. The NXTPAPER 4.0 display does a lot of things well, but outdoor visibility is not one of them.</p><p>I use the TCL NXTPAPER 11 Plus as a way to read manga on the Shonen Jump service, which somehow only costs $3.99 per month and gives unlimited access to a bajillion popular manga series. Color pages look stunning on this display, and the anti-glare matte screen ensures this feels more like a physical book than a shiny OLED does.</p><p>Outside of that, it's really great for just about anything. Android 15 offers great multitasking capabilities, and the included stylus make this paperlike display perfect for writing, taking notes, drawing, or anything else you might want to use a stylus for. Games with amazing art, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=unity.Annapurna.Gorogoa">Gorogoa</a>, are also perfect on the display, making it feel like a painted canvas come to life.</p><p>While you're on the Amazon page, you'll also notice a "TCL NXTPAPER 11 Gen 2" tablet that's even cheaper, but I wouldn't recommend that model over this one because of the sub-par processor.</p><h2 id="black-friday-2025-quick-links-52">Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More post-Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

From the screen recording, the user is seen on the Instagram homepage and then swiping it away, returning to their home screen. However, when trying to open another app, X (formerly Twitter), in this instance, Instagram returns.</p><p>The user explains that they've had this problem "for like six months." They add that they've been unable to prove that they weren't crazy until now with this recording.</p><p>Others were quick to join the Reddit discussion, stating they've also been experiencing this problem on Google's Pixel. One user states they've encountered this issue on their Pixel 8 Pro, as well as their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-hands-on">Pixel 10 Pro XL</a>. This creates an interesting dynamic, as this could be quite a persistent software issue with Google's Pixels.</p><p>Nevertheless, one user claims that the only workaround to this is to "stop for a second, then choose your app or go to the taskbar and then go back to home and then choose the app." While not the fix users are looking for, perhaps this will offer some relief. To make matters more frustrating, the publication clocked some official Google acknowledgement of this issue following user reports through its channels.</p><p>However, per the post, Google has been silent ever since, offering no concrete fixes for the affected devices.</p><h2 id="the-issues-roll-on-2">The issues roll on</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="qqQRMq7YLGyAHU3bGdoCMA" name="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL photos on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qqQRMq7YLGyAHU3bGdoCMA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google's Pixels have been through it, and the most recent issue plagues the Pixel 10 following the company's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/pixel-10-users-face-wi-fi-troubles-airdrop-quick-share-update">AirDrop-Quick Share update</a>.

Users have continued to report that the speakerphone button in the Phone app often becomes "unresponsive" or "laggy." While this has been going on, even more Pixel 9 phones in May, Google hasn't fixed it, and it probably never will. Recently, it was reported that the company marked the issue as "won't fix (Infeasible)" due to "not enough actionable information."</p> ]]></dc:content>

In short, this unique display technology comes with an anti-reflective, matte layer applied on top of a diffused layer, giving the display a unique "paperlike" appearance.</p><p>A handy switch on the side allows you to toggle between full color, a selection of "inky" colors that's good for comic or manga reading, or a full black & white digital detox mode.

This phone will do all the basics and more, but it's not a high-end experience.</p><p>As this is a $169 phone, you shouldn't expect flagship performance or a phone that's going to play graphically-intensive games very well. But if you don't care about that, the TCL 60 XE NXTPAPER is a phenomenal choice for everyday use. Android Central's Managing Editor, Derrek Lee, agrees and said as much <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tcl/tcl-60-xe-nxtpaper-review">in our review</a>.</p><p>"While not a flagship by any means, the TCL 60 XE NXTPAPER does stand out from the pack, thanks to the more eye-friendly display that can effectively transform the phone into an e-reader with the flip of a switch. I like to think of it as having a Boox Palma living inside your smartphone, which should appeal to anyone who likes to read but doesn’t want to carry a separate e-reader with them at all times."</p><p>And since this runs a modern version of Android, you can add any of your favorite Google Play apps to it, including eBook apps like Kindle, Kobo, Play Books, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/libby-library-app-for-e-readers">the Libby library app</a>, and plenty more. And, unlike an E Ink e-reader, this one still looks good if you happen to want to watch a movie or TV show on it, too!</p><h2 id="black-friday-2025-quick-links-57">Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More post-Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The publication cites Weibo leaker, Digital Chat Station (DCS), who highlighted the apparent publishing of charging information for the device in question. According to the 3C certification listing, the phone could debut with 120W charging, which likely refers to its wired option.</p><p>Moreover, the leaker spotted that the alleged Magic 8 Ultra was listed with satellite connectivity support.</p><p>It seems Honor is looking to integrate Tiantong Satellite capabilities within the 8 Ultra, technology that we've seen implemented across other Chinese OEMs before. Additional rumors were mentioned, as the post also taps another Weibo leaker, Smart Pikachu. This social media post alleges that Honor's doing a little more with the Ultra variant by upgrading the phone's "materials." Honor is also rumored to begin focusing on the Ultra's photography with a "new imaging system" and main camera.</p><p>The tipsters didn't mention a potential launch date, but it is expected (per DCS) that a price hike could come for the Ultra variant.</p><h2 id="where-we-might-go-2">Where we might go</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5DJ2dGcN8xPkq78sumyjtK" name="honor-magic-8-pro-hands-on-magic-os-10" alt="The Magic OS 10 update screen on an Honor Magic 8 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5DJ2dGcN8xPkq78sumyjtK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Honor's Magic 8 series <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-magic-8-series-debut-redefines-on-device-ai-imaging-on-device-needs">was just launched in October</a>, and with it came a Magic 8 and a Magic 8 Pro. The OEM put quite a spotlight on the Pro model, as it highlighted its work to further merge the human and machine experience with the handheld. The entire series; however, sports the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 SoC, which brings speed and the appropriate support for its YOYO AI software.</p><p>The Magic 8 Pro already features the new Magic Color engine for more "professional" like film coloring for user photos. This is taken further with its 50MP primary lens with OIS (optical image stabilization), a 50MP ultra-wide lens, and a 200MP telephoto lens. The rumors are suggesting a "main camera upgrade" for the Magic 8 Ultra, though it remains to be seen what that means.</p><p>We're either in for an MP change or, perhaps, there's something software/hardware coming under the hood.</p><p>More importantly, in China, the Magic 8 Pro started at what would be ~$798. A rumored price increase for the Ultra could push us closer to ~$1,000.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Both of these laptops come with a pretty hefty price tag, to be sure, but the regular model is a little cheaper and looks extra appealing at the current price point.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/samsungs-new-galaxy-book-5-lineup-boasts-ai-smarts-and-cross-device-connectivity">Samsung launched the Galaxy Book 5 lineup</a> this year, featuring a rotating 360-degree screen that's perfect for use as a traditional laptop or as a tablet. It also includes a vibrant 15.6-inch AMOLED display, a capable CPU, and a wide range of Samsung's latest Galaxy AI features such as AI Select, Photo Remaster, and more. Meanwhile, the laptop also comes with 512GB of storage as standard, up to 31 hours of battery life per charge, and a lightweight design that makes it easy to transport. Samsung says it can charge up to 39% in just 30 minutes, It's also compatible with other Galaxy devices, easily letting users add an additional screen with their Samsung tablets or phones.</p><p>It's worth noting that the discounted price tag will still cost buyers a pretty penny, but if you were already considering spending around $1,000 on a premium laptop, this might be a good opportunity to pick this one up.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,349.99" data-dimension48="$1,349.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Computer-Touchscreen-Speakers-NP750QHA-KA1US/dp/B0DSLNMY6M" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="4KdivJcVstBJEQC52oJmiK" name="Samsung-Mobile-Galaxy-Book5-Pro-360-screen.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4KdivJcVstBJEQC52oJmiK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4500" height="3000" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung 15.6-inch Galaxy Book 5 360:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Computer-Touchscreen-Speakers-NP750QHA-KA1US/dp/B0DSLNMY6M" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,349.99" data-dimension48="$1,349.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$1,349.99</del> <strong>$949.99 for Amazon's early Black Friday deals</strong></a></p><p>One of our favorite Samsung convertible laptops is currently just $1,000 at Amazon for the retailer's early Black Friday sale, representing a 26% discount on what is normally a fairly pricey device.

Despite featuring the 360-degree display hinge, it's fairly durable and weighs just about 3 pounds, making it perfect for those on the go.</p><p>The laptop also includes two Thunderbolt 4 ports, a USB-A port, a microSD port for expandable storage, and an HDMI port.

The upcoming OnePlus Ace 6T, expected to be called the OnePlus 15R in other markets, looks like it will be the company’s new battery life champion.</p><p>The Chinese variant has been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/7582893032/QfTsl1bbH" target="_blank">confirmed</a> to pack an 8,300mAh cell, the largest ever on a OnePlus smartphone (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-15r-ace-6t-battery-3620412/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>). This makes sense given how people use their phones now. With more gaming, video streaming, and multitasking, battery life is more important than ever, and OnePlus is clearly trying to address that.</p><p>The Ace 6T pairs its large battery with 100W fast charging, offsetting slow top-ups typical of ultra-large cells. This approach challenges competitors who stick to smaller batteries and conservative charging speeds.</p><h2 id="flagship-durability-2">Flagship durability</h2><p>While the battery grabs most of the headlines, the rest of the phone is impressive too. The 15R offers a surprisingly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-confirms-us-launch-for-15r-unveils-first-stylus-for-budget-tablet-line">robust set of durability ratings</a>, including IP66, IP68, IP69, and even IP69K. It’s rare to see this level of toughness in a phone focused on performance, showing that OnePlus wants this device to be more than just long-lasting.</p><p>The OnePlus 15R is also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15r-launch-date-confirmed">expected to run Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Gen 5</a>, giving it the same top-tier processing DNA as the upcoming OnePlus 15.</p><p>It’s still unclear if the global OnePlus 15R will have the same 8,000mAh-plus battery as the Chinese Ace 6T. So far, only the Chinese version is confirmed. Other details like the camera and screen resolution haven’t been revealed yet.</p><p>If the company sticks to this blueprint for the global variant, the 15R could easily become a go-to option for gamers, frequent travelers, and anyone who’s tired of rationing battery life halfway through their day.</p> ]]></dc:content>

A massive class action lawsuit just dropped, claiming the devices are basically broken.</p><p>The case simply states that the Google Nest Hub, Google Nest Hub Max, Google Nest Mini, and Google Nest Audio have become faulty and have otherwise "malfunctioned" over the years.</p><p>Some of the highlighted issues were that these devices no longer "respond to even basic verbal questions." Not only has the Q&A portion of these Nest devices failed over time, but the plaintiffs ( Lieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein, LLP, and Kaplan Gore, LLP) state "widespread complaints" have been reported from consumers who state that these devices do not "interpret or act on voice commands, returning irrelevant information, losing internet connectivity despite a stable WiFi connection, and failing to recognize registered user voices."</p><p>This is being framed by the plaintiffs as a "consumer case" to secure compensation for individuals who purchased these drastically deteriorated devices.</p><h2 id="oneplus-confirms-us-launch-for-15r-with-the-oneplus-pad-go-2-2">OnePlus confirms US launch for 15R, with the OnePlus Pad Go 2</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.79%;"><img id="4uHgpvBmYKPSR4s9k2nfcB" name="oneplus-15r-showcase-qualcomm.JPG" alt="OnePlus executive showcasing the OnePlus 15R" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v2/t:0,l:0,cw:4240,ch:2385,q:80/4uHgpvBmYKPSR4s9k2nfcB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2832" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm / OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-confirms-us-launch-for-15r-unveils-first-stylus-for-budget-tablet-line"><strong>here</strong></a></p><p>OnePlus officially announced that it will be ending the year with another product drop. This time, it's bringing two budget devices to the U.S. and Canada — the OnePlus 15R and the OnePlus Pad Go 2 ( a tablet with a stylus)</p><p>The OnePlus 15R is being positioned as a “value flagship” in the U.S. and Canada markets. The initial specs point to a Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 chip, up to 16GB of RAM, 1 TB storage, and a dual-lens camera setup (50 MP + 8 MP) similar to the Chinese OnePlus Ace 6 model.</p><p>The phone will likely show up with a redesigned body,  consisting of a flat metal mid-frame and a camera module rotated exactly 45 degrees off the top-left corner. More importantly, the phone carries a stack of durability ratings you rarely see on a midrange device: IP66, IP68, IP69, and IP69K.

Vats hops in, claiming that others have said similar things, and that this could be the case for "Phase 1."</p><p>One UI 8.5 Beta 1, is expected to be followed by Beta 2, which the tipster suggests could start two weeks later, on December 22.

I used several of the brand's power banks over the years, and the EnerGeek GX11 easily stands out — this is the smallest 20,000mAh power bank I used, and the size alone was enough to convince me to take it with me on a recent visit to Bali, Indonesia.

The GX11 is the smallest 20,000mAh power bank I used, and I have all the latest Anker and UGREEN models on hand. The sizing alone is an achievement, but you also get global 4G connectivity, and a built-in USB-C cable.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You want the ability to change the bundled SIM card. To get more than 1GB data, you'll need to buy plans via Baseus, and they're costlier than your average travel eSIM provider.</p><p>I don't know how Baseus managed to cram a 20,000mAh battery into a power bank this small, but the sizing is a big differentiator. It's just great to be able to have access to this kind of power in such a small size, and you get 67W USB PD charging, making it convenient to charge phones and any other accessories — there are two USB-C ports and a USB-A port.</p><p>There's also a built-in USB-C cable that doubles as a lanyard, and while it isn't a retractable cable, it didn't prove to be an issue. The power bank did a great job charging my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi/poco-f8-ultra-review">POCO F8 Ultra</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/oppo-find-x9-pro-review">Find X9 Pro</a>, and I didn't have any issues in this area.

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I didn't see the point of photo frames, and I used my Nest Hub for a few years. But that changed when I got the Pexar; this is a 11-inch digital photo frame made by Lexar, and it is nothing short of incredible. It has a 11-inch anti-glare panel with 2K resolution, and the quality of the screen is better than any other photo frame I used.</p><p>It's also extremely easy to set up and use, and you can easily share photos from your phone, or transfer photos to the built-in 32GB internal storage. The best part is the discount; it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/pexar-Resolution-Ultimate-Anti-Glare-Stunning/dp/B0DB1BM71Q">now available for $139</a>, a $30 discount.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="869c84c2-4e63-43e1-b4a4-330f186d5478" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Pexar Starlight that costs $297" data-dimension48="Pexar Starlight that costs $297" data-dimension25="$139.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/pexar-Resolution-Ultimate-Anti-Glare-Stunning/dp/B0DB1BM71Q" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1102px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:71.14%;"><img id="a78DAtqGCKq46GPFTR9fpF" name="Pexar by Lexar" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a78DAtqGCKq46GPFTR9fpF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1102" height="784" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>Pexar's digital frame stands out for two reasons: it's easy to set up, and you can effortlessly share photos to the device. Then there's the panel: with a 2K resolution and anti-glare tech, it does a great job highlighting your family images. </p><p>This is the 11-inch size, and if you need a bigger photo frame, Lexar has the 15.6-inch <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Starlight-Digital-Stunning-Anti-Glare-Touchscreen/dp/B0FP4QDBZ9" data-dimension112="869c84c2-4e63-43e1-b4a4-330f186d5478" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Pexar Starlight that costs $297" data-dimension48="Pexar Starlight that costs $297" data-dimension25="$139.99">Pexar Starlight that costs $297</a>. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/pexar-Resolution-Ultimate-Anti-Glare-Stunning/dp/B0DB1BM71Q" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="869c84c2-4e63-43e1-b4a4-330f186d5478" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Pexar Starlight that costs $297" data-dimension48="Pexar Starlight that costs $297" data-dimension25="$139.99">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You need a high-quality photo frame that's easy to use. The anti-glare panel is the star of the show, and the high resolution combined with a matte texture make it the ideal showcase for your family photos.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You need a bigger size. Lexar now makes the 15.6-inch Pexar Starlight, and it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Starlight-Digital-Stunning-Anti-Glare-Touchscreen/dp/B0FP4QDBZ9">available for $297</a>. I've been using both models, and honestly, the Starlight is the one you should get if you don't mind the bigger size.</p><p>I've been using the 11-inch Pexar digital photo frame for just over six months, and it has been delightful. The key standout feature of this frame is undoubtedly the 11-inch panel with a 2K (2000 x 1200) resolution. The higher resolution makes your photos shine, and the anti-glare coating on the panel means you don't get any reflections even with plenty of ambient light. I have the frame mounted on a showcase in the living room, and the anti-glare tech really makes a huge difference.</p><p>Another big selling point is just intuitive it is to get photos onto the frame; it uses the Frameo platform, and you can just connect to your phone and share images that way. Or if you want to just transfer photos to the frame, it has a built-in 32GB storage, and you can use an SD card or USB-A flash drive to plug into the frame.</p><p>The photo frame connects over Wi-Fi, and is available in two colors: black and tan. I use the black model as that doesn't shift focus to the design itself. There are other niceties, including auto rotation, a clock, and weather info for your location. On the whole, the Pexar is no doubt the best photo frame I used, and if you need a good holiday gift, this is the one to get — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/pexar-Resolution-Ultimate-Anti-Glare-Stunning/dp/B0DB1BM71Q">particularly with a discount to $139</a>.</p><p>I recently got started with the bigger model, the 15.6-inch Pexar Starlight. It has a bold design and comes with a wall light, and the panel quality is just as good, and it gets double the storage at 64GB. It is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Starlight-Digital-Stunning-Anti-Glare-Touchscreen/dp/B0FP4QDBZ9">costlier at $297</a>, but if you need a bigger photo frame, it is the obvious recommendation.</p> ]]></dc:content>
