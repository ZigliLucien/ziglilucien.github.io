<p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr-announcement"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p><p>It's been long teased that Google was working on an XR platform based on Android, with hardware coming from Samsung in partnership with Qualcomm. Now the cat's out of the bag with the announcement of Android XR, a new platform that's set to power smart glasses and XR headsets not unlike the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/gaming/virtual-reality/apple-vision-pro">Apple Vision Pro</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-review">Meta Quest 3S</a>.</p><p>According to Google, the platform will launch first on headsets, with Samsung's Project Moohan set to release in 2025. This will enable users to "switch between being fully immersed in a virtual environment and staying present in the real world," not unlike how some of the best VR headsets work. Smartphone and tablet apps will also work, and Google is optimizing its own apps for the platform.</p><p>Google is also testing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">smart glasses</a>, as we saw with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-project-astra-ar-waitlist-opens-trusted-testers">Project Astra</a>. This will use Gemini to provide information about what you're looking at, and it's suggested that visual cues may also be available.</p><p>There seems to be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr-is-the-most-exciting-new-version-of-android-in-years">a lot of potential with Android XR</a>, which makes it one of the most exciting things to look forward to in 2025.</p>

Gemini 2.0 is taking things to the next level by making it more capable than before, allowing it to better understand the world around you and complete tasks on behalf of the user.</p><p>What does this mean, exactly? This means that Gemini 2.0 is equipped to power experiences like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-project-starline-astra-ar-glasses">Project Astra</a>, which was shown on Google I/O earlier this year. It can visualize the world around you and even remember what it saw so you can recall something later. And with Project Mariner, Gemini 2.0 can complete complex, multi-step tasks for you by understanding what's on your screen, just as a virtual assistant should. We've seen companies like Motorola <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-is-testing-ai-that-skips-words-and-gets-straight-to-doing-what-you-ask">show off concepts</a> similar to this, so it'll be interesting to see how this evolves in 2025.</p>

<p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-qi2-wireless-charging-support-rumors"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p><p>Qi2 has been out for a little while, but it's been mostly absent on Android, save for some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/hmd-skyline-qi2-launch">HMD phones</a>. However, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a>, this could change, as the latest rumors suggest the company might finally adopt the wireless charging spec in its upcoming devices.</p><p>If true, then the Galaxy S25 series will support the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-wireless-charging-standard">Qi2</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phones">MagSafe accessories</a> available for iPhones, allowing them to charge wirelessly at the full 15W instead of being subjected to slower speeds.</p><p>That said, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://suomimobiili.fi/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-muisti-ja-variversiot-suomessa/">a separate rumor</a> suggests that the phones may not have Qi2 integrated into the phones themselves. Instead, the newer standard may only be accessible via compatible cases. This would be similar to what we've seen with recent OPPO phones and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a>.</p><p>If true, it's unclear why companies are opting for this method, but given that many users will likely purchase cases for their phones, it may not be a huge deal. Still, it would be nice to have it integrated for those who may not want a case, but we'll have to wait and see what we get when the Galaxy S25 launches in early 2025.</p>

<p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv-december-2024-price-hike-reported"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p><p>Price hikes for streaming services are nothing new, so the new base price for YouTube TV shouldn't shock anyone, but it will sting. The company announced this week that new users will immediately see the base price of $82.99, a $10 increase from the previous $72.99 that was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv-2023-price-increase">introduced in early 2023</a>.</p><p>The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/youtubetv/answer/9285852">explained</a> that the updated price is due to the rising costs of content but that users can expect to retain their current features and benefits.</p><p>For new users, the price won't update until January 13, 2025, so there's some buffer time in case you want to consider your options or pause your membership. Otherwise, prepare to pay more in the coming month as streaming services continue to reach cable prices.</p>

Journalist and author Andrew Ross Sorkin asked Pichai about his thoughts on where Google is compared to its competitors in the AI race, prefacing it with a quote from Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, who said that Google should have been the default winner.</p><p>Pichai quickly responded by saying he would love to compare Microsoft's <em>own</em> models with Google's, noting that Microsoft is using someone else's.</p><p>It's no secret that Microsoft got a bit of a headstart in the AI space after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/microsoft-bing-edge-openai-chatgpt">partnering with OpenAI</a> to integrate its models into the company's services like Bing.

However, Pichai noted during his talk that while he expects to see more advancements in 2025, we shouldn't expect it at the same pace we've seen.</p>

<p>According to the leaked spec sheet, the Pixel 9a would be incorporating the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-tensor-g4-is-a-key-piece-of-googles-smartphone-vision">Google Tensor G4</a> chipset — the same SoC that powered the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9 series</a>. It will be paired with the Titan M2 security processor, and the configurations of the mid-range handset may include 8GB of RAM and 128/256GB of storage</p><p>The device is believed to ship with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> out of the box as opposed to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a>, and, like the flagship series, Google may offer seven years of OS upgrades and security updates.</p><p>The expected dimensions from the leaked spec sheet show that the Pixel 9a will measure 154.7mm x 73.3mm x 8.9mm, making it slightly taller and wider than the previous iteration, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a>. The device might also be slightly lighter, around 185.9 grams.</p>
<p>The display, with a 120Hz refresh rate, would measure around 6.3 inches and is an AMOLED screen with Full HD+ resolution and a peak brightness of up to 2700 nits. It is believed to feature Gorilla Glass 3 protection on top. The dual cameras at the back will have a 48MP primary lens accompanying a 13MP ultra-wide lens. For selfies, the handset is likely to rely on a 13MP shooter.</p><p>A slightly bigger battery capacity will keep the lights on the Pixel 9a. It will host a 5100mAh battery with support for 23W charging alongside 7.5W wireless charging support. Lastly, the device may also feature an IP68 rating similar to the Pixel 9 series.</p>
<p>The handset is expected to cost $499 (the MSRP in the leaked sheet) and may be available in Obsidian, Porcelain, Iris, and Peony, the latter two being the newest color additions. The spec sheet also confirms the model numbers and device availability in the U.S., U.K., Canada, and India markets.</p><p>In addition to the leaked specifications, we have also seen what the Pixel 9a would look like — thanks to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-real-life-images-leak-again">recent real-life</a> images, which are believed to be prototypes. This isn't the first time we have seen it, as a similar <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-alleged-real-life-photos-leak">real-life image</a> was spotted indicating that the iconic Pixel camera visor design at the back has been removed, and the Pixel 9a will stick to a flat, flushed camera design.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want a powerful flagship phone at a midrange price; great cameras and stylish design are important to you; you need over two days of battery life on a single charge.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you&apos;re interested in the latest AI features or long software support; you need IP68 ingress protection in your devices. </p><p>The OnePlus 12 topped our list of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> this year thanks to a sophisticated blend of thoughtful design choices, outstanding battery life, and Snapdragon-powered performance that could easily rival the best devices from Samsung or Google. </p><p>As senior editor Harish Jonnalagadda points out in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">his 4.5/5-star review</a>, the phone really feels like a culmination of everything that OnePlus has learned over its past ten years of releases. The OnePlus 12 is a refinement more than a reinvention, and in this case, that&apos;s a very good thing.</p><p>Of course, everything isn&apos;t perfect with the flagship. You only get five years of guaranteed OS/security updates (compared to Samsung and Google&apos;s seven-year promise), and you won&apos;t enjoy any of the fancy AI features that have been dominating the airwaves lately. But if you simply want an incredible flagship experience with a record-smashing discount, then this OnePlus 12 deal is for you.</p>

<ul><li>Rumors claim Samsung is preparing to introduce new extra Galaxy Ring sizes, 14 and 15, next year in January.</li><li>There is speculation that these larger sizes could feature "slightly" large batteries, but that remains to be seen.</li><li>A Galaxy Ring 2 patent suggests it could deliver a flexible internal structure and other rumors purport a longer battery life and a thinner profile.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung's Galaxy Ring finds itself wrapped in a new rumor that claims there could be more of it on the way.</p><p>The rumors surfaced on X through a post by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MaxJmb/status/1867578381803327678">Max Jambor</a> who claims Samsung is planning to introduce new ring size options (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-ring-two-more-size-options-january/">SamMobile</a>). Supposedly, the tipster discovered internal model numbers for these extra sizes: SM-Q514 and SM-Q515. Jambor claims that these model names are for Galaxy Ring sizes 14 and 15, respectively.</p><p>Both sizes weigh roughly 3.2 grams and with a diameter of ~23mm and ~23.8mm.</p><p>More importantly, Jambor states an announcement of these Galaxy Ring sizes could occur sometime in January alongside its market availability.</p><p>What's more, the publication speculates that these two extra Galaxy Rings could provide even larger batteries. Currently, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a> is available in U.S. sizes ranging from five to 13. This affects its battery as the smallest size sees an 18mAh battery capacity while the 13 variant features a 23.5mAh capacity. Jambor didn't allude to any such changes; however, there could be a chance that the size 14 and 15 rings grab a <em>slightly </em>larger battery.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">New sizes will finally be available in January!Size 14 (SM-Q514): 3.2g, 23 mm inner diameter Size 15 (SM-Q515): 3.2g, 23,8 mm inner diameter https://t.co/GSyK3iFLaL<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1867578381803327678">December 13, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>This <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-more-sizes-rumor">isn't the first time</a> Jambor has alleged an expansion in Samsung's Galaxy Ring size selection. In September, a post claimed that the Korean OEM was creating additional sizes — 14 and 15 — but that they would debut in "the coming weeks." It seems things have changed as nothing launched in October nor in November and with us in December, it seems Samsung set its sights on the new year.</p><p>Curiously, this extra Galaxy Ring selection <em>could </em>line up with the upcoming Galaxy Unpacked, rumored for January. Next month is expected to host the unveiling of the Galaxy S25 series. Perhaps, if the Galaxy Ring does make a quick appearance, it will be to announce the availability of these additional sizes.</p><p>The O.G. smart ring has been relatively quiet as all eyes have been on its next iteration, the Galaxy Ring 2, as rumors <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-resizing-patent-discovered">suggest a resizing function</a>. A patent discovered in October claims the next Galaxy Ring could offer a "resizing structure" via its flexible internals that will only require Samsung to create one (outer) ring. The band would expand depending on the size of the user's finger for a comfortable fit.</p><p>Elsewhere, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-ring-2-new-enhancements-launch-rumored">rumors claim</a> the Galaxy Ring 2 could receive an increased battery life and a thinner profile.</p>

<ul><li>Google highlighted the rollout of Gemini in Drive, which aims to help summarize a user's folders, documents, spreadsheets, and more.</li><li>Users can write their query for a folder in Drive's side panel or they can navigate to a folder and hit the "summarize folder" button.</li><li>Google recently updated Docs with additional Gemini help for crafting formatted documents while also unveiling Gemini 2.0.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is rolling out an update for Drive users that brings Gemini into its side panel with new tools.</p><p>The company highlighted the latest update in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/12/adding-folder-support-to-gemini-in-side-panel-of-google-drive.html">Workspace post</a>, stating Gemini can now summarize documents in Drive. Google explains that Gemini in Drive can only answer questions about your "text documents, PDFs, spreadsheets, and presentations."</p><p>More specifically, with Gemini entering Drive's side panel, Google states users can write their queries about a folder before the "@" symbol and the name of the folder; i.e., "summarize the files in @AndroidCentral."</p><p>Additionally, Google gives the example of asking about the "theme of the content" within a folder.</p><p>Writing your prompt to Gemini isn't the only avenue toward quick information as users will find a starry icon button in folders, too. Once you receive this update, navigating to a folder <em>should </em>display a "Summarize this folder" button beneath the navigation bar. Clicking this will automatically inform Gemini of your request and produce the side panel with its generated information.</p><p>There will also be a "suggestions" option alongside the likely ability for users to expand on what they'd like Gemini to surface via the text field.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:993px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:60.42%;"><img id="z95tR4SwVx4N6fBpCkRfyQ" name="google-drive-gemini-side-panel-folder-summaries" alt="Google Drive is receiving a Gemini update that lets it summarize the contents of folder, documents, and more." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/z95tR4SwVx4N6fBpCkRfyQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="993" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Alternatively, users can right-click on a document in their list and click "Ask Gemini" for information that way. The side panel expands its uses by letting users drag and drop documents into it instead of the "@" mention method.</p><p>The update started rolling out on December 11 for users under rapid and scheduled release domains. Workspace customers with Gemini Business, Enterprise, Education, Education Premium, and Google One AI Premium add-ons will have access to Gemini in Drive's side panel for summarization.</p><p>Moreover, the company states users need to have "smart features and personalization" enabled before this feature is usable. Admins can turn this on by default for users if need be.</p><p>Gemini's capabilities across Workspace have consistently grown, especially through its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-docs-is-tapping-into-gemini-to-whip-up-formatted-documents">recent update for Docs</a>. The AI utilizes a prompt — "help me create" — which is reminiscent of its recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/google-home-gemini-help-me-create-public-preview">smart home test</a> for Google Home. Regardless, the Google Doc version lets the AI help users create formatted documents from scratch. The AI can also easily grab files from your Drive and incorporate them into a new file for you.</p><p>Elsewhere, Gmail picked up extra Gemini help via "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-in-gmail-contextual-smart-replies-workspace">contextual smart replies</a>." The update to its AI-generated replies will take into account what's been said in your current line of messages <em>before </em>offering a quick suggestion. Additionally, Google unveiled <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-latest-ai-model-gemini-2-0-is-here-to-usher-in-the-agentic-era">Gemini 2.0</a> this week, which prepares to usher in a new "agentic era."</p>

<ul><li>Google detailed its recent "Gemini in Assistant" test for the Public Preview program in the Home app.</li><li>Users will find "AI-powered" answers from the Assistant as it leverages Google's LLM for answers covering a wide range of topics.</li><li>This test is only available on the Nest Audio or Nest Mini (2nd gen) speakers.</li><li>Google recently kicked off another Public Preview test, which involves the "help me create" prompt.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is giving users a way to test Gemini in its AI Assistant on a few Nest devices.</p><p>The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/assistant/answer/15713030">detailed</a> its recent Gemini addition to the Public Preview of the Google Home app in a support document (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/12/11/gemini-google-assistant-nest-mini-audio/">9to5Google</a>). In this test, Google states users will find "new, more natural sounding voices" when leveraging Gemini's help for queries. More importantly, the "AI-powered" answers the Assistant delivers will be enhanced by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>.</p><p>Concerning the AI-powered replies, the support document states the Assistant piggybacks off an LLM (large language model) for more "in-depth" answers on general topics.</p><p>The page delivers a few examples such as ones where a user can "learn more about a topic." This involves a wide range of possibilities; however, Google gives the example of learning about animals and their communication methods and habits. Assistant's Gemini-enhanced capabiltiies bring follow-up questions into this Public Preview test.</p><p>After asking, Google says users can follow up with "Hey Google" to throw another query into the equation. Users can also "interrupt" the Assistant's responses by saying "Hey Google" to ask for additional context or to change your question.</p><p>If you're interested in this test, the post instructs users to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/12494697">join the Public Preview</a> via the Google Home app. However, access to this Gemini in Assistant test is being awarded to Nest Aware subscribers (for now). Users must also opt into the experimental AI features alongside having one of the eligible Nest devices for this Gemini in Assistant test: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nest-audio-review">Nest Audio</a> or Nest Mini (2nd Gen) speakers.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:59.75%;"><img id="SmfaTRfVfbFuLkXoRnhZBm" name="nest-audio-review-3.jpg" alt="Nest Audio" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SmfaTRfVfbFuLkXoRnhZBm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="478" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Daniel Bader / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Those new "natural sounding voices" can be customized by heading into the <strong>Google Home app > Settings > Google Assistant (icon) > Assistant Voices & Sounds</strong>.</p><p>The company explains that its AI-powered answers from the Assistant are experimental. Google realizes that its software could get things wrong, which is why it's urging users to take caution when receiving information.</p><p>Gemini's appearance in the Public Preview for Assistant accompanies another test involving the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/google-home-gemini-help-me-create-public-preview">help me create</a>" prompt. The purpose of the test is to give users an easy way to quickly set up automation for their smart home devices. Through "help me create," users can instruct Gemini to turn their lights on at a specific time or during a specific occurrence, like if they leave the house.</p><p>Right now, this AI feature only works with Nest cameras; however, Google states it is looking to expand its device support.</p>

<p>Shortly after Apple released the third iOS 18.1 Developer Beta, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/magic-eraser-comparison-apple-samsung">I decided to see</a> how well the new "Clean Up" feature would stack up against Google's Magic Eraser and Samsung's Object Eraser. What I ended up with was a thing of nightmares when trying to remove the harness from my dog in a picture.</p><p>Samsung and Google both did a good job, but that didn't come as much of a surprise, given that these tools have been available <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">on various phones</a> for some time. Truthfully, I didn't think Apple's Clean Up would be a viable option and that it would just disappear into the night.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2070px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="TspK8cw2ucPMRV64qWaxHQ" name="apple-intelligence-prompt-imore.jpg" alt="Apple Intelligence prompt on iPhone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TspK8cw2ucPMRV64qWaxHQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2070" height="1164" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As it turns out, the complete opposite happened, as the stable build of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/everything-ios-18-stole-from-android">iOS 18.2</a> arrived this week, packed with "Apple Intelligence" features. Hidden in the midst of the new AI features was an update to the Clean Up tool, which Apple has been apparently working hard to improve.</p><p>After being prodded a bit, the most obvious way to see if Clean Up is actually better was to try it on the same picture from before, using my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>. Much to my surprise, Apple didn't try to mutilate my dog, and the entire process was a lot easier than I expected.</p><p>Because we're working with smaller objects, there's a lot of room for error when making selections. But after loading the picture and tapping the "Clean Up" option, it was as simple as just tracing a line along the harness. The tool then highlighted exactly what I wanted to have removed before automatically doing just that.</p>

<p>The results were more impressive than I thought they would be, so I figured I would try using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-eraser-non-pixel-phones">Magic Eraser in Google Photos</a>. Seeing as it's been a few months since the last time I tried this out, surely Google would still come out on top, right?</p><p>Nope.</p><p>First, I tried using Google Photos on my iPhone since it has Magic Eraser. The results were less than stellar, and it took longer because I had to select the harness in sections. Eventually, I got there, but you can obviously see where the edits were made.</p><p>Then, I thought that I might get better results by using Magic Eraser on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>. After transferring the full-resolution photo and opening it in Google Photos, somehow the results were worse. There's some weird line along my dog's back, and her ear is even more crooked than normal.</p>

<p>Maybe it's just a fluke or something to do with this picture specifically. So, I did the next logical thing, picking a different picture before using Clean Up and Magic Eraser. This time, I opted for something that would probably be more common — removing people from the background.</p><p>I'm not sure if it's just something that I'm doing wrong or what. However, neither the iPhone's Clean Up nor the Pixel 9 Pro Fold's Magic Eraser did a particularly great job. Both results look <em>fine</em> until you start to zoom in and pixel-peep where the people were removed.</p>

<p>When I started writing this, I didn't really have much more to add, hence the first half of the title. But then I went back into Clean Up to make sure that it actually recognized the entire harness at once and that I wasn't just imagining things.</p><p>So I pulled up the picture of my dog again, confirmed that the harness was highlighted, and then was greeted with the following.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1320px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:217.27%;"><img id="L3QyAUes9f2ysAsVYMBbtg" name="safety-filter-leia-iphone" alt="Safety Filter applied after using Apple Clean Up on iPhone 16 Pro Max" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/L3QyAUes9f2ysAsVYMBbtg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1320" height="2868" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Imagine my confusion when Apple applied a "Safety Filter" to the picture when all I was trying to do was remove the harness. I tried it again, just to double-check, and again, the Safety Filter was applied.</p><p>I understand the idea and premise of such a feature — and yes, it's a feature, not a bug — but this is the same picture that I had already been editing before, and it's just my dog standing outside with her harness and lead attached. So, I'm not even sure of the logic taking place here.</p><p>On the one hand, I commend Apple for including the Safety Filter to begin with. On the other, why was it that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/one-ui-7-beta-could-be-just-around-the-corner-with-an-apple-intelligence-like-twist">Apple Intelligence</a> was able to properly edit the photo 10 minutes before, only to incorrectly apply the filter on the <em>same image</em>? It's left me genuinely perplexed, and all I can hope is that this isn't a regular occurrence.</p><p>That being said, even with the aforementioned hiccup, it's tough to argue with the results. In just a few months, Apple has made some pretty big improvements to its Clean Up feature. Now, I have to wonder whether Google will lean on Gemini to improve its own Magic Eraser or if Apple will end up surpassing it.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Nothing's phones deservedly get plenty of praise, but I'm more interested in what the brand is doing with its earbuds. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nothing-ear-1-review">ear (1)</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/nothing-ear-2-review">Ear (2)</a> set a high bar, and the CMF sub-brand is continuing that momentum. I used the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/nothing-cmf-buds-amazing-budget">CMF Buds</a> last year and came away thinking they're the best entry-level earbuds around, and with the Buds Pro 2, Nothing is taking things to a whole new level.</p>
<div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Hardwired</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5u6gVPowTCuSQ8NJeoktj7" name="lloyd-hardwired.png" caption="" alt="Android Central's LLoyd with a bionic eye" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5u6gVPowTCuSQ8NJeoktj7.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text">In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/hardwired">Hardwired</a>, AC Senior Editor Harish Jonnalagadda delves into all things hardware, including phones, audio products, storage servers, and routers.</p></div></div>
<p>Just like the CMF Buds, the Buds Pro 2 have a bold design that immediately allows the earbuds to stand out. With most brands still offering the usual black or white variants, Nothing's bright orange and blue hues are designed to grab attention. <br><br>The rest of the design is thought out well; the case is easily pocketable, and it holds the buds securely. I like the dial on the case, and what's particularly cool is that it acts as a control surface. The dial can be used to control music playback and adjust volume, and that's just plain cool — I don't know why other brands don't do this. <br><br>I also like the design of the earbuds; there's a glossy coat on the shell, but the stalk has a matte texture, and that makes it easier to use gesture controls, and minimizes smudges. The lightweight design ensures the buds are comfortable even with extended listening sessions.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5BFojqY8bzm5iL5XSNkBHT" name="Nothing CMF Buds Pro 2" alt="Nothing CMF Buds Pro 2 buds next to case with smart dial button highlighted" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5BFojqY8bzm5iL5XSNkBHT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's good connectivity as well, and like the rest of Nothing's earbuds, the Buds Pro 2 are configurable via Nothing X. You can customize the sound, adjust gesture controls, and toggle spatial audio — I didn't see any issues connecting to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a>, or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a>.</p><p>But it's the sound that truly differentiates the Buds Pro 2 from other products in this category. You get a 11mm driver in addition to a 6mm tweeter, and Nothing did a fantastic job tuning the buds.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="BktLAxCYMCge6bmvGz8MHT" name="Nothing CMF Buds Pro 2" alt="Nothing CMF Buds Pro 2 buds and case next to Vivo X200 Pro set to equalizer mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BktLAxCYMCge6bmvGz8MHT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In short, these are the best-sounding budget earbuds I've ever used, and the sound quality is equivalent to products that cost thrice as much. Creative's Zen Air are the only other earbuds I used recently that measure up to the Buds Pro 2, and while they nail the technicalities, Nothing's earbuds have a more dynamic and engaging sound. <br><br>There's an Ultra Bass mode if you need a little bit extra in the low-end, and it does a great job adding energy to the mix. While there's no 10-band EQ, you can tweak the bass, mid, and treble in the Custom sound mode, and that's more than what you get with most earbuds. I'm partial to the Dirac mode; this automatically optimizes the sound, and it lends itself well to diverse genres.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="bMLJ2mgefuNepzPeeSMsJT" name="Nothing CMF Buds Pro 2" alt="Nothing CMF Buds Pro 2 next to CMF Buds Pro and Vivo X200 Pro showcasing Ultra Bass mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bMLJ2mgefuNepzPeeSMsJT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's good noise isolation as well, and while it isn't as effective as costlier earbuds, it manages to tune out low-frequency ambient sound, and that should be adequate to most users eyeing these buds. You get other extras as well, including Google Fast Pair, IP55 ingress protection, ability to connect to two devices at once, in-ear detection, and a low-latency mode.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="UyRuuFevJJKMkoMuiYafFT" name="Nothing CMF Buds Pro 2" alt="Nothing CMF Buds Pro 2 next to CMF Buds Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UyRuuFevJJKMkoMuiYafFT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another interesting inclusion is spatial sound; the Buds Pro 2 project a wide sound, and it makes a difference. While it's an admirable effort, if you want the best virtual surround sound, you'll need to get Creative's Zen Air — they're better than anything else in the category.</p><p>I don't really have any negatives; the design is distinctive, the fit is great and doesn't cause any fatigue, you get a lot of useful extras, and the sound is the best in this category. Honestly, you don't get anything that's as good in the vicinity of $50.</p>

Vivo turned that up a notch earlier this year with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-pro-review">X100 Pro</a>; the phone continues to have one of the best camera packages around, and it's only bested by the China-exclusive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-ultra-long-term-review">X100 Ultra</a> — no small feat. <br><br>While the X100 Ultra is the best phone camera I've ever used, the fact that it isn't available globally makes it a non-starter. Thankfully, Vivo is addressing that with the introduction of the X200 Pro. The phone has the same 200MP telephoto lens as the Ultra, and it also takes magnificent portrait shots. You get a new 50MP main camera, and while it doesn't have a 1-inch sensor like the X100 Pro or Ultra, it takes standout photos and videos in challenging scenarios. <br><br>Honestly, that's all you need to know about the X200 Pro — it brings the best features of the X100 Ultra to a global audience, and takes photos of the same caliber. That alone makes the phone immediately worthy of consideration, and you get plenty of other extras, including a new design, brighter AMOLED panel, more efficient MediaTek hardware, a much bigger 6000mAh silicon battery, and IP69 ingress protection. <br><br>I used the global model of the X200 Pro for a week, and here's why I think this is the camera phone to beat in 2025.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-vivo-x200-pro-pricing-and-availability"><span>Vivo X200 Pro: Pricing and availability</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="4mf8Dmh9WsQWaZunAiEZoT" name="Vivo X200 Pro" alt="Vivo X200 Pro with Vivo logo at the back" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4mf8Dmh9WsQWaZunAiEZoT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Vivo unveiled the X200, X200 Pro, and X200 Pro mini in China in October 2024, and the phones made their global debut on December 12 in India. Vivo isn't bringing the X200 Pro mini outside China, but the X200 and X200 Pro are available in global markets, starting with select regions in Asia over the coming weeks. <br><br>I got used to the 1TB model of the X100 Ultra, but Vivo isn't bringing that storage variant to global markets; the X200 Pro is instead sold in a single 16GB/512GB configuration outside China. This 16GB/512GB variant is now available in India for ₹94,999 ($1,120). The standard X200 is also on sale in the country at ₹65,999 ($778) for the 12GB/256GB configuration, and Vivo has an additional 16GB/512GB model that costs ₹71,999 ($849).</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-vivo-x200-pro-design"><span>Vivo X200 Pro: Design</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="zmrmHGBeMyDctgucrEd6uT" name="Vivo X200 Pro" alt="Vivo X200 Pro back against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zmrmHGBeMyDctgucrEd6uT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Most Android manufacturers have switched to iPhone-esque designs, and Vivo isn't immune to the trend either. The X200 Pro has a distinctly boxier design with flat sides, and it doesn't look as elegant as the X100 Pro. While I still prefer devices with smooth curves, I will admit that Vivo did a good job with the design; the phone is much more comfortable to hold than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vBwYCNCLpfvTvk9zeSiWfT" name="Vivo X200 Pro" alt="Vivo X200 Pro next to X100 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vBwYCNCLpfvTvk9zeSiWfT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Predictably, the camera island dominates attention at the back; Vivo has steadily increased the size of the housing over the last three years as it slotted in bigger camera sensors, and the module on the X200 Pro stretches nearly across the width of the device. I would have liked the interior of the housing to have the same color as the back — like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> — but Vivo went with a standard black design. That said, the ring encircling the camera housing differentiates the design a little bit.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Qiif6RCHLRxEGXK4QbHyjT" name="Vivo X200 Pro" alt="Vivo X200 Pro camera module highlighted" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Qiif6RCHLRxEGXK4QbHyjT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I got the Titanium variant of the device, and it feels great to hold and use. The dull grey sheen makes the device look understated, and the back glass has a satin texture that's much better than the usual glossy finishes, and it minimizes smudges. The sides are made out of aluminum, with Vivo mimicking the feel of titanium.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Y6UWk6ckM6nqtueygwzfrT" name="Vivo X200 Pro" alt="Vivo X200 Pro with Vivo logo at the back" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Y6UWk6ckM6nqtueygwzfrT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The design is cleaner than previous years, with Vivo eschewing the various taglines and metal-etched accouterments it added on the X90 Pro and X100 Pro. The overall aesthetic feels mature, and while the grey model doesn't attract attention as much, the blue option is the way to go if you want a color that stands out.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8zkhw89siFa3p9RPsTEYfT" name="Vivo X200 Pro" alt="Vivo X200 Pro bottom view with USB-C port" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8zkhw89siFa3p9RPsTEYfT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Thankfully, Vivo put the ultrasound fingerprint module higher up this time around, and I didn't run into any issues accessing it. While I prefer optical modules, Vivo is using a Goodix sensor that's among the best around; it's fast to authenticate, and doesn't have any problems with oily or wet fingers.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="trn69VauRJhoReoogNAZfT" name="Vivo X200 Pro" alt="Vivo X200 Pro design showcase" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/trn69VauRJhoReoogNAZfT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming in at 228g, the X200 Pro is one of the heaviest phones I used recently, as well as the biggest; that said, Vivo did a great job with the weight distribution, and even though it has massive cameras at the back, it doesn't feel unwieldy in the least. I now put cases on phones that have flat sides as I don't like the in-hand feel, but I didn't have to do so on the X200 Pro; although it has a flatter design, the beveled edges and subtle curves at the back where it meets the mid-frame make it much easier to hold and use.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="XMmAYUGcUJyNLiCxQGHTfT" name="Vivo X200 Pro" alt="Vivo X200 Pro power and volume buttons" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XMmAYUGcUJyNLiCxQGHTfT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The power and volume buttons have better tactility than the Pixel 9 Pro XL and Find X8 Pro, and the rest of the ports are standard: you get a dual-SIM tray, IR blaster, and dual stereo sound. The X200 Pro picks up IP68 and IP69 ingress protection, giving it added resilience against water jets. While I didn't test that yet, the phone fell into a bowl of chutney and came away unscathed, and that's good enough for my use case (I eat a lot of chutney).</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-vivo-x200-pro-display"><span>Vivo X200 Pro: Display</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kiKVeCohBuJreWwPa2zpuT" name="Vivo X200 Pro" alt="Vivo X200 Pro home page" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kiKVeCohBuJreWwPa2zpuT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The X200 Pro retains the 6.78-inch size as its predecessor, and you get the same 2800 x 1260 resolution. What's different this time is the brightness; it manages to hit 4500 nits in HDR content, and there's an easily noticeable difference in daily use as well.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ayNsVNG2p8o9qeBJJynXrT" name="Vivo X200 Pro" alt="Vivo X200 Pro selfie camera" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ayNsVNG2p8o9qeBJJynXrT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What's particularly great is that the X200 Pro got just as bright as the X100 Ultra in outdoor use, and in my testing, only the Pixel 9 Pro XL managed to outmatch the device. It does a much better job in this area than the X100 Pro, and it's evident when using the phones next to each other. You get the usual LTPO tech, and the phone gets 2160Hz PWM dimming at all brightness levels, giving it a distinct edge over Google and Samsung phones.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="v6CPAGwzkTgvsEn4UHFdwT" name="Vivo X200 Pro" alt="Vivo X200 Pro video in YouTube" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v6CPAGwzkTgvsEn4UHFdwT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While it doesn't have anywhere close to the same curvature as previous models, the panel has a very subtle curve around the sides that makes it a little better to use. Colors and contrast levels are excellent out of the box, and like all high-end phones, you get a great range of customizability in tweaking the color balance. Vivo has useful eye protection features as well, including an anti-fatigue mode and automatic blue light filter.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="S8kQMqrrMfvghECSaMh8xT" name="Vivo X200 Pro" alt="Vivo X200 Pro backgrounds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/S8kQMqrrMfvghECSaMh8xT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's a decent selection of always-on styles too, and the phone has a smooth transition from the lock screen to the home screen, which is something you'll see on ColorOS as well. I didn't have any issues streaming HDR content on the phone, and after a dozen hours of gaming, there were no problems in this regard either. The onboard sound is better than the X100 Pro, and you get a good stereo effect.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Uo8jY8eD2r9fYBb2HYmucT" name="Vivo X200 Pro" alt="Vivo X200 Pro coating" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Uo8jY8eD2r9fYBb2HYmucT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The only issue with the panel is that the oleophobic coating is starting to wear out after just a week of use; my daily usage hasn't differed, but the top edge has a visible line where there's no coating, and that's troublesome. By contrast, the X100 Pro has been in regular use throughout 2024, and it doesn't have any issues with the coating. I saw a similar occurrence on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a> too, and I'll provide an update once either brand confirms what the problem might be — it could just be the coating that was used on these two devices.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-vivo-x200-pro-performance"><span>Vivo X200 Pro: Performance</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="RwD9p9SHjjW8aZPwcxnetT" name="Vivo X200 Pro" alt="Vivo X200 Pro about device section" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RwD9p9SHjjW8aZPwcxnetT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the X100 Ultra switched to Qualcomm hardware, Vivo is clearly intent on using MediaTek's Dimensity on the rest of the X100 series, and that's a good decision. The X200 Pro uses the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediateks-dimensity-9400-is-the-biggest-challenger-to-qualcomm-yet">Dimensity 9400</a> — same as the Find X8 Pro — and it is fantastic in daily use. I didn't see any slowdowns or lag, and it handled gaming without breaking a sweat. <br><br>The phone tends to get a little hotter than the Find X8 Pro, but just by two degrees Celsius. The stability score of 49% in 3DMark's Steel Nomad Light test is on the lower end of the scale, but thankfully, you won't see any jitter even in demanding games, and while it throttles in extended gaming sessions, it still delivers steady framerates. With 16GB of RAM and 512GB of UFS 4.0 storage onboard, you don't have to worry about multitasking or storage issues.</p>

<p>Given that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/iqoo-13-review">iQOO 13</a> also runs Funtouch OS and is powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite instead, we can see how the two devices differ. Obviously, there's no difference between the two in regular use, but the iQOO 13 holds up a little better in gaming — it doesn't throttle as early. Other than that, you get a similar level of performance. <br><br>I didn't see any issues with cellular connectivity, but calls were garbled at times; I'm not sure if this was down to where I was at the time or the cellular signal, but I don't usually run into this problem, so thought to highlight it. There's the usual LDAC and LHDC codecs in addition to AptX HD, and you get dual-band GPS, NFC, and a USB-C port based on the USB 3.2 standard. <br><br>The new vibration motor has exquisite feedback, and it makes using the device that much more engaging. Overall, there isn't much amiss with the X200 Pro in this area, and it is has one of the best hardware packages around.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="TZGME8UZtNGkGAu6LPvNuT" name="Vivo X200 Pro" alt="Vivo X200 Pro battery stats" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TZGME8UZtNGkGAu6LPvNuT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Like most other 2025 flagships, the X200 Pro picks up a huge battery, with Vivo slotting in a 6000mAh unit inside the device. It also uses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/most-android-flagships-are-getting-an-exciting-battery-upgrade-in-2025">silicon-carbon tech</a> to deliver better density, and the increased size along with better efficiency allows it to last two days. Even with heavy use, I only had to charge the phone every other day, and it's liberating. <br><br>There's no battery anxiety whatsoever with the device, and when you need to plug it in, the X200 Pro uses Vivo's 90W charging standard, and the requisite charger is bundled in the package. It takes just under 50 minutes to charge the battery, and it's on par with the best phones in this area.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-vivo-x200-pro-cameras"><span>Vivo X200 Pro: Cameras</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="gcv2r2ED7YPJ5NVCxBfPfT" name="Vivo X200 Pro" alt="Vivo X200 Pro camera housing highlighted" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gcv2r2ED7YPJ5NVCxBfPfT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The X200 Pro gets a new 50MP Sony Lytia-818 imaging sensor with a 1/1.28-inch sensor, and while it isn't as big as the 1-inch sensor on the X100 Pro, it does a great job in its own right. The highlight is the inclusion of the 200MP Samsung HP9 telephoto lens, which is the same one used in the X100 Ultra to great effect. The wide-angle lens is a 50MP Samsung JN1, which is unchanged from last year, as is the 32MP front module.<br> <br>Vivo uses a custom V3+ imaging module in conjunction with the Dimensity 9400, and this allows the brand to eke out better detail with HDR video. The X200 Pro has 4K60 Dolby Vision video out of all the sensors and focal lengths at the back, and the phone does a standout job with video in general. There's portrait video, 10-bit LOG, and a street mode that adds a noticeable vignette to resultant shots. <br><br>The camera interface itself hasn't changed, and you get a decent number of shooting modes and filters. Vivo's collaboration with Zeiss is evident in the portrait shots and tonal balance of the photos, and you can pick between three styles: Vivid, Textured, and Zeiss Natural. The Vivid mode has the best colors, and that's the one I used as default when testing the X200 Pro.</p>

<p>As you'd imagine, there are no issues with photos taken in daylight conditions. The X200 Pro does a great job preserving detail, and you get vibrant colors with excellent dynamic range and white balance. While the sensor itself isn't as large as last year, tweaks to the tuning allows the X200 Pro to deliver a similar caliber of photos. <br><br>The main camera does an incredible job in low-light conditions as well, delivering accurate colors and details. Honestly, I don't have anything to fault with the main camera, and the X200 Pro delivers everything I need — photo quality is always consistent, it does a good job with fast-moving objects, and there's no shutter lag whatsoever. <br><br>The biggest change this time is the 200MP telephoto lens; it goes up to 3.7x via optical zoom and has OIS, and while the increased focal length is obviously useful, where the lens truly shines is at portrait shots. The X200 Pro takes delightful portrait shots, with class-leading segmentation and bokeh. The best part about the mode is that you get to choose between five focal lengths, giving you plenty of options to frame a subject. <br><br>Although the wide-angle lens is an older sensor, it does a decent enough job most of the time. It's only in demanding low-light scenarios that you can make out its limitations, but in all other shooting conditions, it delivers usable photos. The only quibble I have in this area is that the selfie lens isn't quite up to scratch. It's still a decent module and takes good photos, but it doesn't have the same quality as the Pixel 9 Pro XL, and Vivo should have switched to a newer sensor. <br><br>Outside of that, the X200 Pro has what is arguably one of the strongest camera packages, and the combination of the 50MP main lens and versatile zoom lens gives it a distinct advantage. I'm intrigued to see what Vivo does with the X200 Ultra, because barring that, I don't see any other device outmatching the X200 Pro in 2025.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CMAJak5jvnm73MHLqYhBtT" name="Vivo X200 Pro" alt="Vivo X200 Pro Android 15 Easter Egg" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CMAJak5jvnm73MHLqYhBtT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I like what Vivo is doing on the software side of things. The X200 Pro runs Funtouch OS 15 based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>, and it is different enough to ColorOS 15 and its derivatives that you don't feel like you're using the same UI. The interface is clean and optimized incredibly well to take advantage of the hardware, and I now prefer it to ColorOS or MIUI — a big deal considering its iOS-esque heritage.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="NoLWsGEddpL22HUzmHHarT" name="Vivo X200 Pro" alt="Vivo X200 Pro notification shade with music on YouTube Music" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NoLWsGEddpL22HUzmHHarT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I don't have any negatives in this area; I didn't see any problems with push notifications or errant crashes, and the UI was fluid in the week I used the device. That's just with this device; as mentioned earlier, I used the X100 Pro as a secondary phone for much of 2024, and didn't run into any issues there either.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="87ittmsMrz5jmAXkQucArT" name="Vivo X200 Pro" alt="Vivo X200 Pro widgets page" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/87ittmsMrz5jmAXkQucArT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Like every other interface, you get a decent amount of AI-backed utilities, including Circle to Search, AI note summarization, transcribing, and translation. Whether they're actually usable is down to your needs; I don't see the point of most AI tools in their current state, and the only one I use with any regularity is the transcribe feature that lets me convert audio to text.</p>
<p>Vivo does a good job with software updates, and the X100 Pro picked up consistent updates over the course of the year. The X200 Pro will receive four Android OS updates along with six years of security updates, and while that's not on par with Google and Samsung, it is in line with what other Chinese manufacturers are doing.</p>

<p>The Find X8 Pro is the closest rival to the X200 Pro, with both phones featuring the same MediaTek Dimensity platform and delivering standout cameras. With the X200 Pro confined to Asian markets, the Find X8 Pro is a viable choice if you need a device with versatile cameras. While Vivo's phone has the edge at portrait shots and zoom, the Find X8 Pro does a great job on its own. I like Vivo's color tuning better, and Funtouch OS is better to use than the most recent iteration of ColorOS, so the X200 Pro wins out.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You need one of the best camera packages available today</li><li>You want a fantastic telephoto lens</li><li>You need a phone that takes stunning portrait shots</li><li>You want class-leading battery life</li><li>You need the latest hardware</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You need the best selfie camera</li><li>You want long-term updates similar to the Pixel 9 Pro XL</li><li>You need a device that's sold in the U.S. or U.K.</li></ul>
<p>Vivo didn't need to change too many things with the X100 Pro, and thankfully, the brand retained the best features from the device. The X200 Pro has one of the best camera packages you'll find today, and the addition of the 200MP telephoto lens gives it a distinct advantage. The portrait shots you get out of the phone are truly incredible, and while the X100 Ultra still has a slender edge, it isn't much. <br><br>I like everything else about the phone. The AMOLED panel is among the best I've used, the hardware is on par with the best from Qualcomm, and the battery lasts two days between charges. The software is great to use as well, and Funtouch OS 15 delivers a good balance between a fluid UI and plenty of customizability. <br><br>The only point of contention is that the selfie camera isn't quite on the same level as other flagships. And with the phone limited to Asian countries, there's no reliable way to get a hold of it in the U.S. or U.K., and that's a real shame. But if you're in a country where the device is sold by Vivo, you should consider picking it up. <br><br>Having used the iPhone 16 Pro Max, Pixel 9 Pro XL, and Find X8 Pro in the last three months, I'm convinced that the X200 Pro has the best cameras of the lot, and my SIM is staying put in this device long after the review is done.</p>
