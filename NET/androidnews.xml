As the publication notes, the kernel is the "marriage" between a device's software and hardware, and Ice Universe reports that Samsung has taken its version up from 6.6.77 to 6.6.98.</p><p>Their post highlights that this is the first time the company has attempted to upgrade its kernel, and it did it unexpectedly.</p><p>The leak adds that this change was discovered in Samsung's One UI 8.5 ZZAA version for the Galaxy S25 series, currently involved in the Beta Program. In their tests, Ice Universe claims that Samsung's One UI system "is smoother and more responsive." Additionally, they state "touch response, animations, and overall fluidity have improved."</p><p>Rumors diverge into two paths from here. On one hand, Ice Universe claims that testers could get their hands on this major update in One UI 8.5 Beta 4. However, another tipster, TheOneCID,<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/theonecid/status/2011296612732322075"> claims this might be</a> Samsung's official One UI 8.5 build for launch. Their post states that they've discovered a similar CZAA build on the U.S. and Canadian servers for Samsung's devices.</p><h2 id="speculations-said-one-ui-8-5-would-be-major-2">Speculations said One UI 8.5 would be major</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4156px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="gCtzEbhj3PCSKj7d6NpSeE" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-One-UI-7-home-screen" alt="One UI 7 home screen on the Galaxy S25 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gCtzEbhj3PCSKj7d6NpSeE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4156" height="2338" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We'll have to see where things progress from here, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/one-ui-8-5-beta-3-lands-on-galaxy-s25-with-bug-fixes-and-january-security-patch">as we've just gotten our hands on</a> One UI 8.5 Beta 3 in January.

According to Mystic Leaks on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://t.me/mysticleaks/149" target="_blank">Telegram</a>, Android could soon have a cleaner, more organized split instead of one large pull-down for everything.</p><p>Currently, Android’s notification shade and Quick Settings share the same crowded space on stock devices like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/best-google-pixel-phones">Pixel phones</a>. Pull down once for notifications, and pull again for toggles. It works, but it’s messy, especially on large phones where everything feels stacked together.</p><p>The latest leak says Google is testing a true split layout in Android 17. This means that swiping from the left edge would show only notifications, while swiping from the right would bring up Quick Settings.</p><p>If this seems familiar, it’s because brands like Samsung and Xiaomi already use a similar approach. The difference is that Google would make this official in Android itself, instead of leaving it to custom skins.</p><p>For regular Pixel users, this change seems to be optional. You’ll probably be able to go to Settings > Notifications and switch between the classic "Combined" view and the new "Separate" layout, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-16-qpr1-split-quick-settings-3562165/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> reported earlier.</p><p>However, if you have a tablet or a foldable, you might not have a choice. The leak says split-view mode will be required on large-screen devices. On a Pixel Fold, you could switch to split view on the inner screen, while only the outer screen might let you go back to the classic merged look. This makes sense for bigger screens, but forcing power users to change their workflow is always a bit risky.</p><h2 id="wi-fi-and-mobile-data-toggles-may-finally-stop-being-annoying-2">Wi-Fi and mobile data toggles may finally stop being annoying</h2><p>The second upgrade is more subtle and, some would say, long overdue.</p><p>Android 12 brought in the combined Internet toggle, which made you use a mini menu to switch between Wi-Fi and mobile data. Google said this helped prevent accidental disconnects, but users felt it made things harder. That debate is still ongoing.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1155px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:137.32%;"><img id="xXqkUTUrLj2n4TNVKCoc39" name="Quick-Settings-toggle-for-internet-and-mobile-data" alt="Quick Settings toggles for internet and mobile data" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xXqkUTUrLj2n4TNVKCoc39.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1155" height="1586" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Mystic Leaks / Telegram)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The new leak suggests Android 17 could bring back separate toggles for Wi-Fi and mobile data. Mystic Leaks says Google is testing layouts that load faster and give you one-tap access.</p><p>This way, casual users have fewer accidental taps, while power users get faster control. It’s a rare win-win for Android’s interface.</p><p>Of course, none of these changes are guaranteed yet. They’re still hidden in early Android 17 builds, so Google could change, delay, or even cancel them before launch.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Additionally, summaries are only available in English.</p><p>Notification summaries are designed to work with long messages or group chats from messaging apps like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-first-things-to-do">Google Messages</a>, Android Messages, WhatsApp, and others. It's not intended for short texts, so AI summaries will not generate in some cases. AI summaries will only generate if your screen is turned off briefly, and will not appear when you're using your phone.</p><p>When a notification is summarized using AI, a sparkle icon will appear beside the generated text. You can tap the summary to reveal the full message.</p><p>It's worth noting that a separate AI feature for notifications, Notification Organizer, debuted alongside AI summaries.

Under <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://law.moj.gov.tw/ENG/LawClass/LawAll.aspx?pcode=Q0010001">Taiwan's Cross-Strait Act</a>, Chinese companies are prohibited from conducting business or hiring employees in Taiwan without explicit government approval.

That branch reportedly handled research and development, as well as verification and testing work for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">OnePlus smartphones</a>, actions that prosecutors say violated existing cross-strait agreements.</p><p>Android Central reached out to OnePlus for comment, and the company responded by saying that its "business operations continue as normal and are unaffected."</p><p>From Taiwan's perspective, the case is being treated as a matter of national security. The country has been increasingly focused on protecting its technology ecosystem and has repeatedly raised concerns about the outflow of talent and intellectual property to China.</p><p>While there have been similar cases in the past, Lau's involvement is notable given his role as CEO of OnePlus and Chief Product Officer at Oppo.

At least a dozen tech brands, most notably Lenovo, pushed a specific AI concept: small wearable gadgets that record and transcribe everything around you, to remember later.</p><p>People have accepted AI wearables like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-gen-2-review">Ray-Ban Meta</a> glasses or smartwatches, with familiar form factors and features <em>besides</em> AI.

Fun names aside, these models are known as Gemini 2.5 Flash Image and Gemini 3 Pro Image. Google put its best image-generation models in users' hands by making Nano Banana Pro available for three images per day, and consumers are clearly loving it.</p><p>Google's vice president of Gemini and Google Labs, Josh Woodward, took to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/joshwoodward" target="_blank">X (formerly Twitter)</a> to announce that users have generated over a billion images with Nano Banana Pro. Woodward noted that this model was only available for 53 days when the major milestone was crossed, signaling that there's significant demand for Nano Banana Pro.</p><p>Since free users only get three Nano Banana Pro generations or edits per day, crossing this threshold suggests <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> users are trying out and returning to the image-generation model. It could also indicate that paid users are taking advantage of Nano Banana Pro access, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google AI Pro</a> subscribers get 100 images daily and Ultra subscribers get 1,000.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Crossed 1 billion images Nano Banana Pro images in @GeminiApp!

Although text generation is a typical pain point for AI image generators, Nano Banana Pro crosses this hurdle easily with the ability to write text in a variety of languages. There are applications beyond basic image edits or cartoon-style generations, such as creating presentation slides or educational charts.</p><p>Users can try out detailed prompts that tell Nano Banana Pro exactly what to do, and then watch the magic happen. Since this is a thinking model, you can trace Gemini's steps as it worked on how to tackle the Nano Banana Pro request. In the example below, a long prompt was used to create an isometric miniature representation of a city.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Dw7ieTGyMC3hkHe7JXHoqb" name="Gemini-3-7" alt="Using the new Gemini 3 and Nano Banana Pro models in the Gemini app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Dw7ieTGyMC3hkHe7JXHoqb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You'll notice that not only does the output contain legible text using personalized typography, but it also looks clean and accurately matches the prompt instructions.</p><p>Nano Banana Pro's image-generation performance seems to be driving more people to use the Gemini app, and it isn't the first time.

At the time, the Gemini VP added Nano Banana edited more than 200 million images in just over a week of availability.</p><p>Now, Nano Banana Pro is following in Nano Banana's footsteps, marking an even bigger milestone with over a billion edits and generations. This is impressive in and of itself, but it's even better for Google considering the wider context of AI image editing today. As competitors find themselves in scandal, Gemini's Nano Banana is emerging as a fan-favorite image generator that is squeaky clean.</p><h2 id="google-s-noncontroversial-image-generator-is-standing-out-2">Google's noncontroversial image generator is standing out</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Squ3rMCQoXoZ8ftoHTkBxb" name="Gemini-3-6" alt="Using the new Gemini 3 and Nano Banana Pro models in the Gemini app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Squ3rMCQoXoZ8ftoHTkBxb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Generative AI has been used for nefarious purposes for years, but the average person and global governments are finally understanding the scope of AI image generations and deepfakes, thanks to Grok, Elon Musk's AI chatbot. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/elon-musks-xai-is-paying-telegram-usd300-million-to-integrate-grok-ai">Grok</a> powers image generation in the X (formerly Twitter) app via xAI and makes it easy to create and edit images on X, sometimes of others and of an explicit nature, by simply replying to a post and tagging the AI bot.</p><p>Grok's behavior is nothing new, as the technology has been available on underground sites before.

The company's guardrails for Gemini image generation, once criticized as being too restrictive, now stand out as potentially the gold standard for reigning in AI bots. Its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gemini.google/policy-guidelines/" target="_blank">policy guidelines for the Gemini app</a> prevent Gemini from generating outputs containing violence, gore, explicit material, threats to child safety, harassment, and more.</p><p>Beyond including the necessary training limits, Google is showing off how Nano Banana Pro can benefit users by being a workplace and learning tool. It can generate custom explainers in Google Search's AI Mode, create charts or infographics in NotebookLM, or diagrams in Google Slides, for example. Nano Banana Pro is also available in Google Vids and Flow.</p><p>Crucially, Google watermarks Nano Banana and Nano Banana Pro generations and edits. Anyone can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-can-now-tell-you-whether-a-video-was-generated-with-google-ai">check if an image (or video, for that matter) was generated with Google AI</a> by uploading it to Gemini and asking.</p><p>Google is winning in the AI image generation space on merit, offering a tool consumers want to use, as evidenced by Nano Banana Pro generating over a billion images in under two months. Perhaps more important is that Google isn't compromising principles to win the AI race. Google's image-generation models aim to be safe and transparent at a time when competitors look to be doing the exact opposite.</p> ]]></dc:content>

These components are critical to smartphones, with DRAM used for RAM and NAND used for storage.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/CYBERPOWERPC/status/1993126805658911041">CyberPowerPC</a>, global memory prices have surged by as much as 500%, while SSD prices are up nearly 100%, with no immediate signs of cooling down. If these increases were temporary, brands could have absorbed the costs and waited for prices to normalize.</p><p>However, that does not appear to be the case, meaning the higher costs are now likely to be passed on to consumers.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/getpeid/status/2011264565598912657">Pei took to X</a> to say that smartphone prices, including Nothing's own devices, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tech-talk-why-your-next-phone-will-cost-more">will increase in 2026</a>. He noted that the industry has long operated under the assumption that smartphone components would inevitably become cheaper over time, but that assumption no longer holds true.</p><h2 id="why-smartphone-prices-will-increase-in-2026-2">Why smartphone prices will increase in 2026</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SLExDmBSVbqsgXmho6v3zA" name="Nothing-Phone-3a-Pro-Phone-2-vs-2" alt="The Nothing Phone 3a and 3a Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SLExDmBSVbqsgXmho6v3zA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Much of the increase is driven by competition for the same memory components used in AI data centers. As smartphones and AI infrastructure now compete directly for DRAM and NAND supply, prices have risen sharply as a result.</p><p>Pei added that memory costs have already increased by up to three times and are quickly becoming one of the most expensive components in a smartphone. This has significantly raised the bill of materials for manufacturers, with some estimates suggesting memory modules that cost under $20 a year ago could exceed $100 by the end of the year for top-tier devices.</p><p>As a result, your next smartphone is likely to be more expensive than it otherwise would have been. Pei also confirmed that prices across Nothing's smartphone portfolio will "inevitably" increase, partly because some devices launching in Q1 2026 will move to faster UFS 3.1 storage.</p><p>While this may not be entirely surprising coming from Pei, Nothing is one of the first major Android brands to publicly confirm that smartphone prices will rise in 2026.</p><p>In other news, Samsung has reportedly been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-galaxy-s26-price-is-reportedly-stuck-in-limbo-thanks-to-rising-memory-costs">considering price increases</a> for the upcoming Galaxy S26 series, although there is no official confirmation yet. The Galaxy S26 series is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-launch-date-reliable-leaker-confirms">expected to launch on February 25</a>, 2026.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The patch, as detailed on Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://security.samsungmobile.com/securityUpdate.smsb">Security Updates</a> page, contains 21 fixes for these devices. Among these, 19 are marked as "High" priority fixes, while two settle for the "Critical" tag.</p><p>Samsung states it's rolling out a fix for CVE-2026-20969, which concerns an issue where attackers could inappropriately "access file with system privileges." Other fixes were included to fix vulnerabilities with attackers accessing out-of-bounds memory, a bypass for Carrier Relock, and more.</p><p>In actuality, as SamMobile notes, the entire patch holds roughly 55 fixes for Samsung's latest flagship models. As always, Google's side holds a bit more, as per its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/2026/2026-01-01">Android Security Bulletin</a>. Google detailed one critical fix en route for devices with Dolby components.</p><p>The post highlights that the January patch bears vBYLR. Users should know that the patch is slowly making its rounds in South Korea. It's not out of the norm, but users should likely prepare to see the patch hit the U.S., Europe, and other areas late this week, if not the week after.</p><h2 id="prepare-for-more-updates-2">Prepare for more updates</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6w5UthvdBXHJwg7fEnzRfB" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-android-logo" alt="The "Powered by Android" screen that appears when booting up a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6w5UthvdBXHJwg7fEnzRfB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As previously stated, this is the second January patch that Samsung has rolled out for the Galaxy S25 series; however, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/one-ui-8-5-beta-3-lands-on-galaxy-s25-with-bug-fixes-and-january-security-patch">the first was for One UI 8.5 Beta testers</a>. A few days after New Year's, Samsung pushed a patch to its beta testers for its 8.5 Beta 3. The update was a massive 1.2GB download for users, further strengthening its enormous number of fixes for bugs. Among them, Samsung aimed to fix lock screen glitches, gallery lag, widget bugs, and much more.</p><p>The One UI 8.5 beta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/one-ui-8-5-beta-reportedly-delayed">started a little later</a> than previously expected, likely due to issues Samsung had with its S26 series. The company was reportedly busy trying to narrow down the devices it wanted to offer consumers in 2026, which seems to be the S26, S26 Plus, and an S26 Ultra, per usual.</p><p>As you'd expect, this updated software is positioned as a much grander update, nothing like a smaller 8.1 update. Rumors suggest that this update will arrive alongside the Galaxy S26 series before rolling out to other models, like the S25.</p> ]]></dc:content>

We’re getting an early peek at the software that may make this all possible.</p><p>A Reddit user seems to have spotted the companion app for Google's smart glasses.  They managed to snag it by running the Android Studio preview release and setting the API to Canary preview.

After continuously being called out by the community, the company announced its "2026 Service Improvement Plan," which starts with the AYANEO Pocket Play Kickstarter campaign being temporarily paused.</p><p>As outlined on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ayaneo/comments/1qa8t1j/ayaneo_2026_service_improvement_plan/" target="_blank">r/ayaneo subreddit</a> and in a corresponding <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ayaneo.com/article/911" target="_blank">blog post</a>, AYANEO's Service Improvement Plan is comprised of five different categories. These include the likes of "Shipping & Crowdfunding," along with the "After-Sales Experience." Within the plan, there are various targets and tasks, such as the new "<em>help@ayaneo.com</em>" email address, a "repair guarantee," and even plans to launch an "overseas warehouse."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2376px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:134.22%;"><img id="U23GgFHWYgsPC9KsZWDFEi" name="ayaneo-service-improvement-plan-graphic" alt="AYANEO 2026 Service Improvement Plan graphic" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U23GgFHWYgsPC9KsZWDFEi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2376" height="3189" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYANEO)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For years, AYANEO and other Chinese-based gaming handheld manufacturers have relied on the likes of Kickstarter and Indiegogo as to fund its various products. The way it works is that essentially a product is announced, the campaign is opened, money is received, and the devices are shipped after the campaign reaches its goal and production begins. However, AYANEO has been treating Indiegogo more like a traditional storefront, with the campaigns reaching its goals almost instantly, mostly due to low goals being set.</p><p>The problem is that some are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/android-gaming-handhelds-are-awesome-but-theres-an-ugly-side-to-the-space-that-im-tired-of-ignoring">waiting months and months</a> to receive a device from AYANEO directly, while others are able to head over to AliExpress or even Best Buy and get one much sooner. One such example is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/ayaneos-konkr-pocket-fit-elite-could-set-the-bar-for-android-gaming-handhelds">KONKR Pocket FIT</a>, which was announced in July 2025. Despite a successful campaign, AYANEO has still yet to fulfill all of the orders from backers, while some (including myself) have been able to order one via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/pocket-fit-gaming-handheld-g3-gen3-8gb-ram-128gb-storage/CZTW4GQ2LP/sku/11441747">Best Buy</a> and have it delivered in less than a week. On the flip side, I backed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/the-ayaneo-pocket-ds-is-the-worlds-first-dual-screen-android-handheld">AYANEO Pocket DS: Retro Power Edition</a> in August 2025, but only just this week received a tracking number.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3584px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.19%;"><img id="BD4RHnMFKuDM6MFJahXSXZ" name="ayaneo-pocket-ds-render-retro-gray-3" alt="AYANEO Pocket DS" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BD4RHnMFKuDM6MFJahXSXZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3584" height="2014" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYANEO)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Just today (January 13), an update was posted to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.indiegogo.com/en/projects/konkr/pocket-fit-premier-hi-performance-android-handheld/updates/13" target="_blank">IGG campaign</a>, stating that "only 128 units of Pocket FIT G3 remain unshipped" while "a few hundred pre-orders" from the website remain unfulfilled. Not only that, but the Pocket FIT was expected to be arrive around the same time as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayn-odin-3-is-the-first-snapdragon-8-elite-handheld-starting-at-just-usd299">Odin 3</a>, making it one of just two handhelds powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite. Unfortunately, that model has been removed entirely, with current shipments now expected to commence "within March."</p><p>Ultimately, this has been a problem in the space for some time, but with AYANEO specifically, it wasn't until creators within the community became more vocal. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/P9FGaj8Jfxg?si=Oi-HYXRd9M4-Y--_" target="_blank">Zu Reviews from Retro Handhelds</a> was one of the first, with Russ from Retro Game Corps following suit in both his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/CImhz8sVEy8?si=kTBNx9m2ba_857Ji" target="_blank">Pocket Vert review</a> and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://youtube.com/post/UgkxPkCrbgsSiVJTKSmLI2rz7cGetxGF8oRi?si=wiiHzcPjfW40uC5c" target="_blank">YouTube Community post</a>. Others, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ayaneo/comments/1q6mp4d/why_i_am_stopping_my_ayaneo_reviews_a_matter_of/" target="_blank">Kei's Retro Gaming</a> have also voiced their issues and concerns on the matter, effectively "putting the pressure" on AYANEO to make drastic and meaningful changes.</p><p>Although there are some who will claim they've always called out AYANEO for its practices, it's really amounted to nothing until more creators and community members united together. Regardless of why, what's clear now is that the company is finally ready to make changes. Now, we just have to hope AYANEO follows through on the plan it outlined, and that this doesn't just end up as being a bunch of smoke and mirrors.</p> ]]></dc:content>

And as you might expect, this last-minute update has been causing problems since then.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2r-review">Watch 2R</a>, both released in 2024 running Wear OS 4, were originally supposed to receive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> between July and September 2025; only after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-watch-2-missing-wear-os-5-update-3606156/">Android Authority</a> asked about the delay in October did the company say the update would arrive "in the near future."</p><p>Now, <em>some</em> OnePlus Watch owners have received the update, though not everyone; my U.S.-based OnePlus Watch 2R, for example, still shows Wear OS 4 and the May 2025 security update. But this might be a blessing in disguise, given the update's effect.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="nZiXpT7tg2oRywSpkeECbb" name="OnePlus-Watch-2R-battery.jpeg" alt="The battery life summary on the OnePlus Watch 2R.

The Watch 2 and 2R regularly lasted about three days in smart mode before the update; now, some users say it won't last a full day, even after trying factory resets and other fixes.</p><p>"I'm utterly heartbroken and frustrated with the drastic battery drain issue plaguing my OnePlus Watch 2 following the Wear OS 5 update," says one user. "My OnePlus Watch 2 now plummets from full charge at 1:00 PM to a critical 10% by 11:00 PM on light usage."</p><p>"Earlier I used to get 2.5 days easily with most settings on (at least 2 days)... Now barely getting 1 day," says another user. Someone responded that his drain wasn't quite as bad, but that he'd gone from 3–4 days before to "a strict 2 days" now.</p><p>Several users point to specific apps causing the drain, like the Weather app, Play Store, or "Wear OS" itself, but the variety suggests this is a system-wide issue rather than one app causing problems.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kmaCRN8ScFgfRm9u9NRJTH" name="oneplus-watch-3-wear-os-logo" alt="Holding a black OnePlus Watch 3 with the Wear OS logo on its display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kmaCRN8ScFgfRm9u9NRJTH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What makes this update especially frustrating to users is that stock Wear OS 5 is (A) a very subtle update with few notable changes and (B) supposed to make Wear OS<em> </em>run <em>more</em> efficiently, as it did on Pixel and Galaxy Watches. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-review">OnePlus Watch 3</a> has run this version since April with no issues, making this unoptimized update on last-gen models disappointing to see.</p><p>Any brand can push a buggy update, but two weeks later, I'd have expected OnePlus to either roll it back or announce a timetable for fixes. Instead, OnePlus hasn't made any official announcement, from what we've seen. My colleague reached out to OnePlus about the update a few days ago, but we've yet to hear back.</p><p>Having recommended the OnePlus Watch 2R as my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch#section-best-budget-option">best budget Android smartwatch pick</a>, mostly on the strength of its battery life, this update is deeply concerning to me. OnePlus needs to prove that its promise of two Wear OS updates and three years of security updates isn't just empty rhetoric, and that it'll properly support these watches.</p><p>As it is, it's notable that the recent OnePlus Watch Lite skipped Wear OS entirely, using a proprietary RTOS like the original OnePlus Watch.</p> ]]></dc:content>

However, what stands out in this leak is that the publication <em>and </em>the tipster allege a launch window in February. Quandt's BlueSky posts claims that Google is preparing to launch the mid-range model in "mid-February."</p><p>DroidLife highlighted its own research, and it supposedly discovered retail listings that have posted "similar details." The publication took it a step further, stating that the Pixel 10a could see a specific launch date of February 17, 2026 (that's a Tuesday, in case you're wondering).</p><p>Quandt's post continues with some last-minute device details, suggesting the phone will debut with 128GB and 256GB storage options. Consumers can pretty much expect these totals to remain low, as has been Google's previous trend. The tipster then highlights colors, such as Obsidian, Fog, Lavender, and Berry.</p><h2 id="a-mid-range-10a-2">A mid-range 10a</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="DwFtKFjkXMsLFtvQfRWaAE" name="Google Pixel 9a" alt="Google Pixel 9a next to Pixel 8a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DwFtKFjkXMsLFtvQfRWaAE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As far as colors go, there was an earlier leak last year that kinda-sorta mentioned how "bold" they'd be, but that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10a-may-launch-much-earlier-withpretty-bold-colors">was based on its supposed wallpapers</a>. A leak from Telegram claimed the Pixel 10a would debut in shades of black, blue, dark blue, red, and green. The "red" could probably be paired with "Berry," while "black" is most likely "Obsidian," now. In other news, there was a huge Pixel 10a leak before the year's end in December, speculating on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/more-pixel-10a-leaks-suggest-specs-close-to-googles-last-mid-range">a device that's not too different</a> from the 9a.</p><p>After a report spotted the phone receiving certification on Verizon's network, specifications highlighted a ~6.3-inch display, a 5,100mAh battery, and an 8/128GB  (RAM/storage) configuration. Moreover, a 48MP main camera was spotted, too.</p><p>The screen is said to be an FHD Plus display, which rounds out specs that make the 10a feel like a 9a. There's hope that the mid-range will be upgraded in other ways, like its Tensor G4, but there's nothing for certain yet. Additionally, it was previously theorized that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10a-surfaces-in-a-new-leak-with-a-nearly-identical-to-pixel-9a">phone could debut in March 2026</a>. While the current leaks go against that, it's still early.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The phone retails for the same $299.99 price tag of its predecessor, but it now comes with strong display protection, the latest Android version, a higher resolution selfie camera, and a larger battery. All of these upgrades should help position it as the ultimate lower mid-range offering. However, Samsung already has a strong contender at this price point with the Galaxy A26.</p><p>Launched in March 2025, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-launches-the-galaxy-a56-5g-a36-5g-and-a26-5g-with-awesome-intelligence">Samsung Galaxy A26</a> has some distinct advantages over the Moto G Power 2026, like more years of OS upgrades, better display tech, and even a lower price after discounts. Choosing between the Moto G Power 2026 vs. Galaxy A26 is not going to be easy, but there are some stark differences which might make one a stronger choice over the other.</p><h2 id="moto-g-power-2026-vs-samsung-galaxy-a26-design-and-display-2">Moto G Power 2026 vs. Samsung Galaxy A26: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iG73CHrsqWsTAQSAgqyoPd" name="Moto G Power 2026" alt="Moto G Power 2026" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iG73CHrsqWsTAQSAgqyoPd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Moto G Power 2026 has the same design and dimensions as its predecessor. It's not as slim or compact as the Galaxy A26, but it does have superior certifications for toughness. There's an IP68/IP69 rating for the ultimate water ingress protection. You even get MIL-STD-810H certification, which ensures the phone can survive harsh drops and temperatures. The new colors look very nice, too.</p><p>The display of the Moto G Power isn't as impressive on paper compared to Samsung, but it's not bad either. You get a larger 6.8-inch Full-HD+ IPS LCD display with up to 1,000 nits of brightness. The refresh rate is also 120Hz. which has now become sort of a standard for most Android phones. Motorola has improved the shatter protection on the G Power with Gorilla Glass 7i, but this is still not as good as the Victus+ glass on the Galaxy. One good thing is that G Power has a textured TPU back panel, so there's little to no risk of shattering when dropped.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1188px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="JT3RhN6rpND3aVvVt3D5Qa" name="Samsung Galaxy A26 all colors" alt="All colors of the Samsung Galaxy A26" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JT3RhN6rpND3aVvVt3D5Qa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1188" height="668" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung really stepped up its game with the Galaxy A26's design. It still has that unmistakable budget look due to the waterdrop display notch and thick bezels at the bottom of the screen, but it gets an IP67 rating now, which wasn't there on the A25. It's slimmer and lighter than the Moto G Power, and you get Gorilla Glass Victus+ for the front and back of the phone. This should give the A26 a more premium in-hand feel, but all the glass on the back is still prone to damage if you're not careful.</p><p>Samsung has started using Super AMOLED screens for most of its phones now, and the Galaxy A26 gets a 6.7-inch panel with a crisp resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate. Colors and black levels should be richer and deeper compared to the IPS panel on the Motorola.</p><p>One thing that Samsung has removed, though, is stereo speakers. It's a bizarre move considering the A25 had it. I guess you win some, you lose some.</p><h2 id="moto-g-power-2026-vs-samsung-galaxy-a26-hardware-specs-2">Moto G Power 2026 vs. Samsung Galaxy A26: Hardware & specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MP7ZQoDNJ8SVkGRXBvt5Ld" name="Moto G Power 2026" alt="Moto G Power 2026" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MP7ZQoDNJ8SVkGRXBvt5Ld.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Moto G Power 2026 features the MediaTek Dimensity 6300 SoC, which is the exact same one used in the older model, too.

The chip is alright for the most part and even handles games fairly well, provided you tone down the quality settings of heavier titles.</p><p>Once again, there's only one variant of the 2026 Moto G Power out there with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage. The latter is expandable via a dedicated microSD card slot. The phone also features a headphone jack, stereo speakers, and FM radio — features that are absent in the Galaxy A26.</p><p>The Moto G Power 2026 has a slightly larger battery than the Galaxy should help it last longer per charge, at least on paper.

However, you can find unlocked international variants on Amazon with 8GB RAM and 256GB storage for under $250. This makes the Galaxy much better value for money if you plan on picking up the global variant.</p><p>Most of the models sold in the U.S. and globally feature the Exynos 1380 SoC, which is more potent than the MediaTek chip in the Moto, at least on paper. I'm not sure to what extent the 6GB RAM variant would cripple performance, but ideally, get the one with more RAM if you can. Even though performance should be better than the Moto G Power, remember that this is still a budget offering, so limit your expectations accordingly.</p><p>Samsung has given the Galaxy A26 a 5,000mAh battery, which should give it solid one and a half to two days of runtime, just like the Moto. The maximum charging speed is 25W, which is a bit slower than what Motorola offers.</p><h2 id="moto-g-power-2026-vs-samsung-galaxy-a26-software-2">Moto G Power 2026 vs. Samsung Galaxy A26: Software</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4127px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="NWRTfeLt2Bo9sgFK4eyfJ4" name="moto-g-power-2026-evening-blue-hero" alt="The Motorola G Power 2026 in an evening blue color beside a coffee." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NWRTfeLt2Bo9sgFK4eyfJ4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4127" height="2321" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Moto G Power 2025 was promised two OS upgrades and three years of security updates, and we assume the same holds true for the 2026 model as well.

The two OS upgrade commitment is something that's hard to overlook, especially if you plan to use it for longer.

Reality Labs has been responsible for AR, VR, AI, and robotics development since its creation in 2020 and has historically spent billions on R&D each quarter.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/12/technology/meta-layoffs-reality-labs.html">Earlier reports</a> suggested that Meta was "trimming the fat" in the VR hardware research, OS development, and Horizon Worlds gaming social network development. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/2011132640536002799?s=20">new information</a> suggests that the cuts are far deeper than we expected.</p><p>Meta is reportedly closing most of its first-party game development studios, including the houses responsible for respected VR games like Deadpool VR, Asgard's Wrath 2, Supernatural, and Resident Evil 4 VR. The studios rumored to be closing are Armature Studios, Sanzaru Games, Twisted Pixel, and Within. LinkedIn profiles confirm job cuts at all of these studios, but</p><p>Meta is said to be keeping Beat Games, BigBox VR, Camouflaj, and Ouro open. These studios are responsible for the development of Beat Saber, Population: One, Batman Arkham Shadow, and Horizon Worlds, respectively. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/meta-closes-twisted-pixel-armature-sanzaru-games/">UploadVR</a> says it has independently confirmed the studio closures.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2634px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.32%;"><img id="w5menaReGjXp2KkbYQ5LaN" name="reality-labs-phoenix-mock-up-luna" alt="A mock-up of Reality Labs' Phoenix ultralight VR headset prototype made by Luna on X" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/w5menaReGjXp2KkbYQ5LaN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2634" height="1747" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @Lunayian on X)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Android Central has reached out to Meta for comment, but didn't receive a response in time for publishing. If true, this news would be a massive blow for the VR community and a huge hit to VR game development.</p><p>To date, Meta has closed several of its first-party studios over the years. We reported exclusively on the closing of Echo VR's studio back in August 2024, and Meta closed Unit 2 and Downpour Interactive in 2025. These cuts come after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-reality-labs-budget-2026-quest-4">a 30% cut to the division</a> in early December 2025, despite <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.roadtovr.com/quest-is-outselling-nintendo-switch-2-on-amazon-and-every-other-game-console/">outselling the Nintendo Switch 2 and other consoles on Amazon</a> during the Christmas holiday period.</p><p>Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth is expected to hold a company-wide in-person meeting on January 14, 2026, to discuss changes being made at Reality Labs. The company is believed to be shifting more resources to AI and smart glasses products in place of its historical commitment to VR development. We still expect Meta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/new-meta-quest-4-rumors-lighter-headset-2025">to debut a new product</a> early in 2027 that's a hybrid of smart glasses and a traditional VR headset, currently known as Project Phoenix, pictured above in a mock-up.</p> ]]></dc:content>

That's a shame, really, because the Razr Plus is a standout device in its own right, boasting a durable clamshell design, two gorgeous pOLED displays, and reliable performance that could easily hold its own against Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-review">Z Flip 7</a>. </p><p>The Razr Plus (2025) is also just a joy to hold and use, with a solid metal frame, Pantone-certified color variant, and luxurious vegan leather finish. The battery life and camera quality are also solid, and while four years of software updates feels limited against the competition, the Snapdragon chipset and 12GB of RAM ensure that the clamshell device will be sufficiently powerful for years to come. </p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="B3mn9bipkoL5uzHYU22Hb7" name="motorola-razr-plus-2025-cover-screen-01" alt="The Motorola Razr Plus 2025 on a fancy plate with its cover screen illuminated and unlocked" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B3mn9bipkoL5uzHYU22Hb7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As I mentioned above, the catch is that you'll need to sign up for T-Mobile's Experience More or Experience Beyond plan to get the free phone. Both of those <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/best-unlimited-data-plans">data plans</a> give you unlimited talk, text, and premium data on T-Mobile's unmatched 5G network, plus a high-speed mobile hotspot, international coverage, and a few entertainment perks you might not expect, such as subscriptions to Netflix and Apple TV.</p><p>The Experience More and Beyond plans start at $90 and $100 per month for a single line, respectively, but you can lower that price considerably by taking advantage of AutoPay and multi-line discounts. Add four lines on the Experience More plan, for example, and it'll drop down to $42.50 per line per month. </p><p>Of course, that still isn't exactly cheap, so if you're trying to save money on your phone bill, it's worth mentioning that T-Mobile is also offering $600 off the Razr Plus (2025) when you add a line with "most plans". That could drop the price of the flip phone down to $199.99 with a cheaper (albeit less perk-heavy) data plan. The choice is yours.</p> ]]></dc:content>

According to a new report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=5548" target="_blank">The Elec</a>, the phone will sport a 6.66-inch AMOLED QHD+ display.</p><p>Samsung reportedly came very close to axing the Plus model entirely. The original plan was to replace it with a Galaxy S26 Edge, a slimmer device designed to compete with the industry's obsession with thin phones. But after watching the market — specifically the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-sales-arent-meeting-expectations-report-claims">lackluster sales of the Galaxy S25 Edge</a> and the iPhone 17 Air — the company got cold feet.</p><p>In a last-minute pivot in late 2025, Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-galaxy-s26-edge-dead-before-launch">scrapped the Edge</a> and brought the Plus back from the dead.</p><p>Because this decision happened so late in the development cycle, Samsung didn’t have time to cook up new hardware. Instead, engineers had to grab what was already on the shelf.</p><p>Sources from The Elec report that the Galaxy S26 Plus will feature a 6.66-inch AMOLED screen (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/samsung-galaxy-s26-plus-display-leak/" target="_blank">Android Police</a>). If that number sounds familiar, it should. It is almost the same display size found on the Galaxy S25 Plus (6.7 inches). You get the same resolution and the same general tech, likely because Samsung opted for a "verified specification" to ensure it could hit its manufacturing targets on time.</p><p>The recycling effort doesn't stop at the display. You are also looking at a 4,900mAh battery and 45W wired charging, specs that are identical to the predecessor.</p><h2 id="the-base-galaxy-s26-quietly-benefits-2">The base Galaxy S26 quietly benefits</h2><p>While the Plus tread water, the standard Galaxy S26 might actually get a small bump. According to The Elec, the base model’s screen is growing to 6.27 inches, up from the 6.2-inch panel on the S25.</p><p>There is also a silver lining for wireless charging fans. While wired speeds are stagnant, rumors point to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/new-galaxy-s26-leak-suggests-the-plus-model-is-actually-massive">inclusion of built-in magnets for Qi2 support</a>, which could finally boost wireless charging speeds past the old 15W limit.</p><p>Production for the S26 Plus is already underway this month, with the Ultra model having a head start since December, according to the report. However, this approach might come with a sting in the tail: component costs are rising, and we might see a price hike despite the lack of major hardware upgrades.</p><p>With the Unpacked event now <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-may-have-locked-in-the-galaxy-s26-launch-date">rumored for February 25</a>, and retail availability slipping into March, the S26 Plus looks like it will be a solid, if unexciting, workhorse.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The patch is rolling out for phones ranging from the Pixel 7a to the Pixel 10 series. All devices are preparing to receive the update marked as vBP4A.260105.004.E1. The main highlight of this patch is that Google is finally rolling out a fix for a series of GPU-related issues that have plagued many Pixel phones.</p><p>The post states, "General improvements for GPU performance in certain conditions" are arriving today (Jan 12).</p><p>Of course, these issues primarily concern the Pixel 10, 10 Pro, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-early-impressions">10 Pro XL</a>, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-early-impressions">10 Pro Fold</a>. Other display fixes this month include yet another AOD (always-on display) patch for "flickering under certain conditions." This was a problem that the Pixel 10 series also struggled with quite frequently in December, following that update.

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>When you buy a smart home device that relies on an internet connection or cloud servers for functionality, a clock starts ticking. These devices will not work forever, because eventually, the companies that made them will decide to no longer support them. Some smart home and Internet-of-Things gadgets last much longer than expect, while others will be shuttered far earlier than customers predicted.</p><p>Internet-connected devices will be discontinued at some point — this is inevitable. What happens after is uncertain. Some brands leave customers high and dry with bricked hardware and others offer refunds or store credit to allow customers to upgrade to newer (supported) models.</p><p>The best option, though, is for smart home brands to open-source the software powering discontinued hardware. This route allows the community to step in and keep their smart home gizmos running forever. After software is open-sourced, users can self-host their smart home servers, tap into platforms like Home Assistant, and leverage community projects to keep hardware out of the landfill.</p><p>A few months ago, Bose announced that its SoundTouch speakers were entering their end-of-life stage, and would stop receiving official support in February 2026. What happened next is a case study in how smart home companies should work with their customers to thoughtfully sunset products when they can't be supported anymore.</p><h2 id="bose-got-it-wrong-then-made-it-right-2">Bose got it wrong, then made it right</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="LKGD3aMotdUmxb9HEu7ZJ9" name="bose-soundlink-plus-controls.JPG" alt="Bose SoundLink Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LKGD3aMotdUmxb9HEu7ZJ9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Speakers should theoretically last forever, but once smart functionality is in the mix, you can't take anything for granted. Bose's SoundTouch lineup of home theater speakers and soundbars were "smart" and used cloud-based features for music playback and multi-room listening. They were also <em>expensive</em>, with some models costing well over $1,000.</p><p>In its initial October 2025 announcement, Bose said that beginning Feb. 18, 2026, it would discontinue cloud support for all SoundTouch products. The hardware would no longer receive security updates, the app would shut down, and Spotify/TuneIn integration and multi-room playback would disappear.</p><p>Understandably, this wasn't received well by users, who <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bose/comments/1o2cnhw/bose_ending_cloud_support_for_soundtouch/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button" target="_blank">expressed outrage on Reddit</a> over their smart speakers turning into dumb speakers. According to the original plan, SoundTouch speakers could continue playing music over Bluetooth, Aux, or HDMI, but that was it.</p><blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bose/comments/1o2cnhw/bose_ending_cloud_support_for_soundtouch">Bose ending cloud support for Soundtouch</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bose">r/bose</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><p>Don't let anyone tell you collective outrage doesn't work, because Bose changed its tune last week in response to the customer complaints. The company's updated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bose.com/soundtouch-end-of-life" target="_blank">email</a> to customers said that Bose has "been listening carefully" to SoundTouch owners and is making changes accordingly.</p><p>Specifically, the cloud support shutdown date has been extended to May 6, 2026, the SoundTouch app will remain available for local control post-shutdown, and the SoundTouch API will be open-sourced for the community.</p><p>This is about as big of a win as Bose SoundTouch users could've imagined. Cloud support is still going away, but AirPlay and Spotify Connect "should continue to function," according to the company. When the cloud servers shut down, the SoundTouch app will be updated to a local version allowing users to set up, configure, remotely control, and group systems.</p><p>While some features, like cloud music services and presets, will be discontinued in May, they may not be gone for long. Bose's consumer-friendly decision to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://assets.bosecreative.com/m/496577402d128874/original/SoundTouch-Web-API.pdf" target="_blank">open-source the SoundTouch software</a> gives the community a chance to bring lost features back.</p><h2 id="open-sourcing-smart-home-products-is-a-win-for-everyone-2">Open-sourcing smart home products is a win for everyone</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:900px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="XwDiz9UjBYDuLMtnHKr5ND" name="Nest-learning-thermostat-wiring-lifestyle-16x9-01.jpg" alt="Nest Learning Thermostat wiring" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XwDiz9UjBYDuLMtnHKr5ND.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="900" height="506" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Open-sourcing the SoundTouch software always seemed like the best option for Bose. It benefits everyone. Bose can safely shut down the cloud infrastructure powering SoundTouch systems, putting that resources toward newer product lines. Meanwhile, consumers can continue to use most of their speakers' functionality, and the open-source community can help them regain — or even surpass — the lost features.</p><p>This is quite the opposite of how other companies have handled sunsetting older hardware. Last year, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/google-is-dropping-support-for-the-first-two-generations-of-nest-learning-thermostat">dropped support for the first and second-generation Nest Learning Thermostat</a> models. This effectively killed their most useful features, reducing them to "dumb" thermostats. Sounds familiar, right? It's a similar start to Bose's handling of SoundTouch speakers.</p><p>Except Google only offered owners of affected Nest Learning Thermostats $130 off the price of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/the-new-nest-thermostat-has-a-better-display-and-you-can-personalize-its-home-screen">a new fourth-generation model</a>. It didn't make an effort to restore basic functionality or open-source the software for the community.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2420px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:70.83%;"><img id="vNkL546nWbiqWJfyX5Hud9" name="No-Longer-Evil-Website" alt="The NoLongerEvil website." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vNkL546nWbiqWJfyX5Hud9.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2420" height="1714" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: NoLongerEvil)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As it often does, the open-source community found a way regardless. One developer Cody Kociemba, reverse-engineered the Nest API to restore certain Nest Learning Thermostat features in a project called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/codykociemba/NoLongerEvil-Thermostat" target="_blank">NoLongerEvil Thermostat</a>.</p><p>The end result is arguably the same — both Bose and Google Nest users have a makeshift solution to keep their devices running for longer — but the public perception is different. Bose seems receptive to feedback and acts like it cares about its customers, while Google's path feels more anti-consumer.</p><h2 id="the-major-players-like-google-amazon-and-samsung-should-take-notes-2">The major players like Google, Amazon, and Samsung should take notes</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jSSLQeQfekhRGSeqZHpw6a" name="echo-show-10-nest-hub-max-2.jpg" alt="Echo Show 10 (right) and Nest Hub Max (left)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jSSLQeQfekhRGSeqZHpw6a.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div></figure><p>Companies rarely do what Bose did last week. It's uncommon for a company to make a move, actually listen to their customers, and reverse course. While Bose is still shutting down cloud support, its updated approach is a complete turnaround compared to the original plan. It's one that respects the needs of Bose as a company and the customers who spent hundreds or thousands investing in SoundTouch products.</p><p>In other words, it's a decision Bose deserves praise for having the courage to make.</p><p>It's also the blueprint for every smart home company watching this situation unfold. The next time a brand like Amazon, Google, or Samsung needs to discontinue a product, follow in Bose's footsteps. Provide users with as much local functionality as possible, and let the community do the rest by open-sourcing the software.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The tipster made an allegation, claiming that Samsung was implementing "more new technologies" in its 2027 Galaxy S Ultra camera system. What this new technology could bring was explicitly stated, though you'd imagine it would involve photography and, potentially, videography quality.</p><p>On a hardware level, the X post stated that Samsung may implement a new sensor for the device, called "S5KHP6."</p><p>Speculation expects this to be the ISOCELL HP6, officially, as the tipster adds that it may retain the same "size" as the HP2. As SamMobile notes, if that's to be believed, then the HP6 <em>could </em>feature 200MP capabilities, likely for its main lens, on top of a 1/1.3-inch format.</p><h2 id="take-a-photo-2">Take a photo</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The size is the same as HP2.But there are more new technologies being added. https://t.co/5qJlv0MCeB<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/2010323328909942863">January 11, 2026</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>The timing of this rumor on social media is interesting, considering Ice Universe <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-ultra-leaks-reveal-a-hidden-camera-boost-and-top-tier-speed">shared another report</a> about the Galaxy S26 Ultra's camera. Rumors purport that the phone could receive an unlikely camera boost by way of a 24MP mode, courtesy of Good Lock’s Camera Assistant. It was speculated that, once enabled, your 24MP option will appear in the Photo and Portrait modes in the camera app.</p><p>Nothing's set in stone right now, as the tipster said Samsung was testing the waters on this idea.</p><p>Additional Samsung Galaxy S camera rumors suggest the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-might-bring-an-old-but-gold-camera-feature-back-in-a-future-galaxy-s">could even return an old</a> (but gold) feature: dual-aperture. It was rumored that Samsung could return "narrow" and "wide" apertures, a feature befitting scenarios where light could be a key issue. The smaller the aperture number, say f/1.8, the wider your lens, and vice versa. The report claimed that Samsung may chase this due to Apple. If this becomes a reality, there's speculation and anticipation for it on the S27 series.</p><p>Other S27 series rumors include <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/if-you-want-better-samsung-facial-recognition-the-galaxy-s27-might-be-it">a "full-face" biometric scanner</a> that is, supposedly, "sptoof-resistant."</p> ]]></dc:content>

This one gives us more information about the camera specs of the foldable.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.galaxyclub.nl/samsung/galaxy-z-flip-8/">Galaxy Club</a>, the company could be sticking to the same camera specs as the Galaxy Z Flip 7 this time around, meaning the Galaxy Z Flip 8 might feature a 50MP main camera, a 12MP ultrawide camera, and a 10MP selfie camera under the display. With still no telephoto lens in sight.</p><p>Before you get all disappointed, the leak also notes that Samsung may bring camera "quality upgrades" by complementing the existing camera system with new sensors, or even giving us better AI features that could boost image quality.</p><p>On the other hand, though, the Galaxy Z Flip 8 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-z-flip-8-could-get-makeover-with-thinner-build">might be a tad slimmer</a> than its predecessor, according to previous leaks, "significant improvements" for the Galaxy Z Flip 8 by reducing both the thickness and weight of the device by more than 10%, reaching about 5.85mm when unfolded.</p><p>Other rumors are that the next Flip will get the Exynos 2600, Samsung’s first 2nm chip, and a slightly larger 4,300mAh battery, which seems like a promising upgrade from its predecessor. Despite changes to the chip and battery, Samsung might freeze the price of the Galaxy Z Flip 8,  keeping the base model at $1,099.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Flip 7 didn't do as well as the Korean OEM would have expected it to, despite featuring a larger cover screen and a new Snapdragon chipset. But, the company apparently expects the Galaxy Z Flip 8 to outsell the Z Fold 8, with insiders calling it "the key to next year's increase in foldable sales."</p> ]]></dc:content>

Future Apple Intelligence features, including an AI-enhanced version of Siri, are slated to arrive on iOS this year. It's a move that wasn't unexpected, but now it's official.</p><p>It also makes perfect sense for both companies. As usual, that means financially, but also allows both sides to provide something they really want without Herculean effort.</p><h2 id="this-is-what-google-wants-2">This is what Google wants</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3955px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="G3i5RVjGzg3rcB3qgwquKW" name="Google-office-logo.jpg" alt="Google office logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/G3i5RVjGzg3rcB3qgwquKW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3955" height="2226" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When you think of Google, you probably picture things like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-testing-search-results-lots-pictures-and-no-words">Search</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/turns-out-gmails-ai-email-summaries-arent-as-secure-as-we-thought">email</a>, as well as powering about a zillion phones around the world.</p><p>That's true, but when you break everything down, Google is a software services company. Yes, they sell <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-11">phones</a> and other products like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-review" target="_blank">watches</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-speaker" target="_blank">smart speakers</a>, but these are avenues to deliver what the company does best: software services. The more people who use these services, the more money Google stands to make because of the ways the company monetizes us through what we see.</p><p>A great way to put even more Google software services in front of even more eyes is to work through built-in native iOS features. Every <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> is chock full of Google software, and the company wants every iPhone and iPad to be the same way.</p><p>We've seen this all along. Google famously cut a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/apple-seeks-to-defend-google-search-distribution-deal">deal to make its Search the default in Safari</a> until the government stepped in and said that was market abuse. The company wants every smart device, no matter who makes it, to use Google software and services.</p><p>I don't expect the all-new Siri to scream "powered by Google" in our faces, but Google will still benefit, especially behind the scenes through user data, whenever someone asks Siri anything.</p><h2 id="why-is-this-what-apple-wants-2">Why is this what Apple wants?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2070px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="TspK8cw2ucPMRV64qWaxHQ" name="apple-intelligence-prompt-imore.jpg" alt="Apple Intelligence prompt on iPhone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TspK8cw2ucPMRV64qWaxHQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2070" height="1164" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This side of the equation is a little more interesting. While I'm not privy to any of the details that went on during negotiations between Apple and Google, I'm certain this is exactly what Apple wants. Ask yourself a few simple questions, and you'll probably agree.</p><p><strong>Why Google? </strong>We all think of Apple and Google as rivals, and that's true in many ways. Both companies want your money and your attention, and every year they each try to one-up each other to get them.</p><p>There are also other companies Apple could have picked to power a "smarter" Siri. Apple currently uses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/openai">OpenAI</a> to deliver some of its device intelligence features. But <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/ive-tested-gemini-3-and-it-proves-google-has-what-it-takes-to-win-the-ai-race">Google has a few advantages</a> in this space that make it the best choice for Apple: familiarity and scalability.</p><p>Google knows how to incorporate AI into existing smartphone features and software; it's been doing it for the past five years or so, and only made a big fuss about it when AI became the new buzzword. Gemini is a stand-alone product, but it also powers — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/youre-using-ai-all-the-time-and-might-not-even-know-it">directly or indirectly</a> — plenty of other Google and Android services. Google and Apple can fine-tune the way Gemini fits into AI on iOS in ways no other company can.</p><p>This will take a dedicated team, of course. Google has the means (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/07/alphabets-market-cap-surpasses-apples-for-first-time-since-2019.html" target="_blank">the company is worth nearly $4 trillion</a>) to build out a dream team of developers to work with Google, so Apple Intelligence and Siri are the same familiar features iOS users love, only much better.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PpmajmgmLSjs36PDDam9oC" name="WWDC-2024-keynote-apple-intelligence" alt="Apple WWDC 2024 keynote presentation featuring Apple Intelligence features and descriptions" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PpmajmgmLSjs36PDDam9oC.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>An even more interesting thought is that Apple can't do this itself and probably doesn't even want to. Building out the technology to power a complete AI foundation is something Apple is capable of doing, so why didn't the company just do it? Time and money.</p><p>Let's say Apple started working on building its own models and software to build out a full-stack suite of AI abilities two years ago. That means the company would still be a decade behind companies that were banking on AI tech and had pioneered it. Companies like NVIDIA and IBM. And Google.</p><p>Apple's first and biggest priority is to build great devices that people love to buy. You may not want an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-17-pro-review">iPhone </a>or a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/using-mac-with-android-phone-developer-apps">MacBook</a>, but plenty of people do because they are damn good products; in some ways, they are the best products out there. This is something the company will never appear to compromise on; every initiative to increase profit margins on Apple devices is tied to the idea that they are still better than ever.</p><p>That means Apple can't just sit back and allow Siri, and even Apple Intelligence as a whole, to... well, suck (for lack of a better word). Consumers are seeing more and better, and demand more and better from their iPhones. Apple wants to give it to them so people love their next iPhone as much as they loved their last iPhone.</p><p>This all means Apple either has to buy the tech to enable its AI features to be as good or better than everyone else's, or work with a company that's already very good at it and is thirsty for a partnership. That company, you guessed it, is Google. Apple <em>saves</em> money by using Google and can still bring the features consumers want in 2026 to the table.</p><h2 id="ios-will-still-be-ios-2">iOS will still be iOS</h2><p>The next generation of iOS isn't going to turn into another Android version, no matter how much Google Gemini is inside of it. The company will still maintain strict control over everything that consumers see and do.</p><p>The difference is that by working with Google instead of a competitor or even trying to do it all itself, the newest tech when it comes to AI will be available for everyone buying an iPhone.</p><p>Both sides are winners here.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Do you need lots of battery life? What about a touchscreen? Do you need something portable to throw in a backpack or do you plan to keep the Chromebook on your desk most of the time? Answer these questions before placing an order and you'll be enjoying a dream device in no time.</p><h2 id="what-should-a-chromebook-be-used-for-2">What should a Chromebook be used for?</h2><p>Most folks use Chromebooks for school, work, or basic tasks like browsing the web or streaming video content. These laptops are known for their straightforwardness, affordability, and portability; if you need a device for serious PC gaming or file management, you'll be better off using a traditional laptop.</p><h2 id="where-can-i-find-the-best-chromebook-deals-2">Where can I find the best Chromebook deals?</h2><p>Unsurprisingly, big retailers like Amazon and Best Buy generally offer some of the best deals on Chromebooks, but you can also check the manufacturers' sites to see if they're running any special promotions.

On social media, the tipster alleges that "Another product getting cancelled is the OnePlus Open 2..." This spurred some sorrow on X from replies, but the publication chimed in with some supposed information of its own.</p><p>The post claims that OnePlus has "cancelled" the global launch for its long-awaited Open 2 successor.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> originally launched late in 2023, and we've been awaiting what was next from the company, even speculating <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-really-hope-the-oneplus-open-2-doesnt-make-the-same-mistake-as-the-pixel-9-pro-fold">what could be nice</a>, too. Now, leaks allege that OnePlus was in an "advanced testing stage" for the foldable before the decision was made to drop the global product altogether. Some specifications leaked, suggesting the device was preparing to rock the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 and deliver a 1TB storage variant with 16GB RAM.</p><p>A 50MP camera and a 32MP selfie lens would've captured your memories, while an 8.1-inch 2K resolution main display (6.6-inch cover) would've met your gaze.</p><p>Keep in mind: these are rumors. It's been alleged that OnePlus <em>might've </em>cancelled its foldable successor due to the sharp rise in RAM. The OnePlus Open 2 was thought to debut sometime in 2026, potentially this summer, but that might not happen.</p><h2 id="holding-out-hope-2">Holding out hope?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ndeq2mxzw4FUe39JxB2neG" name="oneplus-open-22.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ndeq2mxzw4FUe39JxB2neG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We've been stuck in this weird two-year-long rumor phase for the OnePlus Open 2, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-2-resistance-rating-camera-specs-tipped">as some reports claimed</a> it would receive an improved IPX8 rating and wireless charging.

For context, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review">Magic V3</a> measures 4.35mm unfolded and 9.2mm folded.</p><p>Early last year, rumors surfaced, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-says-it-will-not-be-launching-the-oneplus-open-2-this-year">stating 2025 wouldn't be the year</a> for the OnePlus Open 2. Supposedly, the Chinese company was taking a step back to "recalibrate" its foldable strategy moving forward.</p> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>If there's one thing consumers in the audio market have proven over the past few years, it's that they like hearing sound without having something in their ears. That's why bone-conduction headphones, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/best-open-ear-earbuds">open earbuds</a>, and even smart glasses with open-air speakers have taken off. Now, audio brands are trying to figure out how to use these technologies to enhance the listening experience while sleeping.</p><p>It might sound odd to those who haven't tried it, but many people enjoy listening to white noise, podcasts, audiobooks, or music as they fall asleep. Some try to use their everyday earbuds for this purpose, which can be uncomfortable for side sleepers. Others buy a dedicated pair of sleep earbuds, like the great <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/soundcore-sleep-a30-hands-on">Soundcore Sleep A30</a> I previously tested. And a few just use their phone speaker under their pillow, hoping for the best.</p><p>None of these options is perfect, but Jabees is trying to provide another alternative with a Bluetooth speaker designed to go under your pillow. I've tested it, and although it's not perfect either, it seems like the best option for side sleepers who don't love wearing earbuds to sleep.</p><h2 id="how-the-jabees-peace-pillow-speaker-works-2">How the Jabees Peace Pillow Speaker works</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8960px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oC5VcZhuVVEctcu4htaMGH" name="Peace-Pillow-Speaker-7" alt="The Jabees Peace Pillow Speaker in the hand and on a pillow." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oC5VcZhuVVEctcu4htaMGH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8960" height="5040" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Jabees Peace Pillow Speaker is small enough to fit in your hand, and that might be surprising. It certainly wasn't what I expected when this audio accessory came in the mail. After spending time with it, the pillow speaker's compact and portable size may be its biggest strength. I tend to have trouble sleeping while traveling, because my body's internal clock gets thrown off, and having a tiny pillow speaker I can bring with me for white noise or music listening sounds appealing.</p><p>It works by using a variation of bone conduction, similar to that used in bone-conduction headphones. Although it's marketed as a bone-conduction pillow speaker, that's not exactly the best way to describe it. Bone conduction headphones work by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-do-bone-conduction-headphones-work">sending sound vibrations through the bones in your cheek</a>, which are perceived by your inner ear. By comparison, this pillow speaker works by sending sound vibrations through your pillow, which can then be heard by your ear.</p><p>Putting aside the marketing discrepancy, the important thing is that it works. With the speaker under your pillow, it amplifies the vibrations, making them easy to hear at medium-to-high volumes. You're supposed to put the speaker under the part of your pillow where your ear is expected to rest. Location matters if you want to get the best experience.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8960px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5fVmxHeSKXFvwmYnCWtYCG" name="Peace-Pillow-Speaker-2" alt="The Jabees Peace Pillow Speaker in the hand showing the buttons and ports." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5fVmxHeSKXFvwmYnCWtYCG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8960" height="5040" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's a Bluetooth speaker, but this device can also run independently using audio files stored on a microSD card. A 1GB card is included with the "plus version," and it comes with eight white noise and nature sounds. The standard version is only about $4 cheaper, so you should go with the plus bundle if you plan to use the white noise sound. Those who only want to connect to their phone can skip the microSD card and save a few bucks.</p><p>There are three yellow, high-visibility buttons for on/off and volume control. Some of these buttons serve multiple functions, like how the power button is also used for pairing, and the volume up key is used for a sleep timer. Speaking of, that feature is handy if you don't need your music to play all night — it can auto-stop after 30 minutes, an hour, or two hours.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8960px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nXVP4gqCuQjzNs5WTqjquG" name="Peace-Pillow-Speaker-6" alt="Using a Google Pixel 9 Pro XL for scale to show the size of the Jabees Peace Pillow Speaker." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nXVP4gqCuQjzNs5WTqjquG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8960" height="5040" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Using a Google Pixel 9 Pro XL for scale to show the size of the Jabees Peace Pillow Speaker. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The battery lasts up to 10 hours, meaning you'll get a full night's sleep from the speaker, but not much more. Using the sleep timer might help you get a week out of it. Charging via USB-C is pretty easy: just plug the pillow speaker in where your phone charges overnight, then wake up.</p><h2 id="it-s-better-than-your-phone-but-worse-than-sleep-earbuds-for-some-2">It's better than your phone, but worse than sleep earbuds (for some)</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8960px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="UAg4YirDaABJ8GGcUZFBXH" name="Peace-Pillow-Speaker-9" alt="The Jabees Peace Pillow Speaker on a pillow next to a smartphone." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UAg4YirDaABJ8GGcUZFBXH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8960" height="5040" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The price is important to keep in mind here — it's $36 for the standard version or $40 for the plus bundle with a microSD card. That should give you an idea of how the Jabees pillow speaker will sound. The quality isn't outstanding, but it blows a phone speaker away by a mile. That's because a phone speaker fires its best audio out the bottom, while this pillow speaker sends sound vibrations upward through your pillow.</p><p>When using it, you'll have to decide whether you want the pillow speaker to be discreet or loud. At a volume I'd consider comfortable, it is loud enough that someone sleeping next to you might be able to hear it. Lower volumes are less intrusive to partners, but work better for subtle white noise than for music and podcasts you need to hear.</p><p>If it's between a phone speaker and the Jabees Peace, give me the dedicated pillow speaker. As a side sleeper, I get louder volumes and enhanced clarity compared to my phone without uncomfortable earbuds in my ears. I also like being able to use my phone or set it on a nightstand while keeping the music playing under my pillow. However, it won't be for everyone.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8960px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BdbuyJpqtmwav8xVzh4ZNH" name="Peace-Pillow-Speaker-10" alt="The Jabees Peace Pillow Speaker between a pillow and a couch." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BdbuyJpqtmwav8xVzh4ZNH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8960" height="5040" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Sleep earbuds still win for those who need high volume without disturbing a sleeping partner. Additionally, premium options like the Soundcore Sleep A30 have gradual morning alarms that this pillow speaker can't replicate. While it's a rare winner for side sleepers, those who sleep on their back may not be able to hear the pillow speaker well enough.</p><p>Save for those edge cases, the Jabees Peace Pillow Speaker is an intriguing option for those who need audio to fall asleep. It's particularly great for its portability, and it seems like a perfect companion for those who need extra help sleeping while traveling.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="836f074d-8bd2-43b9-a1cd-4d8ab3d133f1">            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Pillow-Speaker-Sleeping-Built/dp/B0DWX3GNTV/" data-model-name="Peace Pillow Speaker" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B5Sojo7mKqcsbGFe77Ghfd.jpg' alt="The Jabees Peace Pillow Speaker in a white press render."></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class='featured__brand'>Jabees</div>                                        <div class="featured__title">Peace Pillow Speaker</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Best for sleep</strong></em></p><p>This pillow speaker uses vibrations to send music through your pillow and into your ears.

Despite being a color edition, it still feels like a high-contrast paper reading experience, not unlike some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-e-ink-tablet">best E ink tablets</a>, while still coming with 16GB of storage. It also has multiple contrast modes for reading, so you have some room to adjust the page displays to your liking.</p><p>The Colorsoft, being one of Amazon's premium e-readers, also features a pretty impressive battery life with each charge. Add in water resistance, a massive selection of titles, and a 7-inch display, and you're looking at a good discounted price on a solid device.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Amazon Kindle Colorsoft (16GB): $249.99" data-dimension48="Amazon Kindle Colorsoft (16GB): $249.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Kindle-Colorsoft/dp/B0CGVSKR1G" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1175px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:92.34%;"><img id="faP7HXkqTeYpAckwkWoh7f" name="amazon-kindle-colorsoft-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/faP7HXkqTeYpAckwkWoh7f.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1175" height="1085" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Amazon Kindle Colorsoft (16GB): </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Kindle-Colorsoft/dp/B0CGVSKR1G" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Amazon Kindle Colorsoft (16GB): $249.99" data-dimension48="Amazon Kindle Colorsoft (16GB): $249.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$249.99</del> <strong>$199.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>Amazon's best color e-reader, the Kindle Colorsoft, is currently $50 off for a limited time.

The display is 150 ppi in color, 300 ppi in black and white, and it also offers a 16-level gray scale brightness. At its normal price point, the Colorsoft might feel a little pricey for those who aren't really sure if they'll want a color display, though the $200 price tag definitely seems a little more appealing.</p><p>While the retailer also offers a "Signature Edition" Colorsoft model with more storage and a few other improved features, this deal is for the non-ad-supported edition with 16GB of onboard storage. Nevertheless, it's a pretty good price on the regular edition, whether you're a first-time e-reader buyer or you're looking to upgrade from an economy-level model.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The companies have entered a multi-year collaboration that will put Gemini at the core of Apple's next generation of phones. This collaboration is also set to power Apple's intelligence features, including a more intuitive and personalized Siri later this year.</p><p>In a joint statement, the companies <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/NewsFromGoogle/status/2010760810751017017">announced this move officially</a> via X on the News from Google profile. After what is described as "careful evaluation," Apple decided that "Google's AI technology provides the most capable foundation, and is excited about the innovative new experiences it will unlock for Apple users." For Google, this comes as a massive milestone as Gemini will now become a platform that not just powers AI on Android, but also Apple's AI future as well.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1340px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:60.75%;"><img id="NdWcdneEZ7oDXnbdEEY7h7" name="Apple-picks-Google-for-Siri" alt="Apple picks Google's Gemini for a massive Siri upgrade, ditching ChatGPT" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v2/t:0,l:0,cw:1340,ch:754,q:80/NdWcdneEZ7oDXnbdEEY7h7.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1340" height="814" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google News via X)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As of now, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-needs-google-now-more-than-ever">Apple's devices have OpenAI's ChatGPT </a>integrated into iOS as an optional assistant for more complex queries, rather than relying solely on Siri. That partnership gave Apple a fast way to catch up with GenAI; however, ChatGPT didn't become the foundation of Apple's devices. Things look different for Gemini as it now sits at the very core of Apple's AI strategy.</p><p>This means that Google's Gemini is no longer just Google's answer to ChatGPT or Siri; it could essentially become the underlying intelligence for both Android and iOS. This is such a big deal since Apple has always positioned itself as a company that builds everything in-house, from hardware to software.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="cUjcwsMsSmhRDdURybst2D" name="WWDC-2024-keynote-new-siri-animation" alt="Apple WWDC 2024 keynote presentation featuring Apple Intelligence features and descriptions" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cUjcwsMsSmhRDdURybst2D.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Apple's decision to utilize Google for its upcoming AI advancements subtly implies an acknowledgement that the AI race is moving too fast for even a $3 trillion company to keep up alone.</p><p>While this move is incredible for all parties involved, the post also states that Apple will continue to use its own devices and secure cloud servers to protect user data and keep things private.  This means Apple will retain control over data handling, user privacy protections, and integration with iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. In short, Apple wants to leverage Gemini without giving up on its tightly controlled ecosystem.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Gone are classic staples like the OnePlus design language, Hasselblad image processing, and the Alert Slider. Instead, you get an iPhone-inspired chassis, a new OnePlus DetailMax processing engine, and a focus on gaming and long battery life. There are some unfortunate downgrades, too, like subpar camera hardware and lower-resolution displays.</p><p>Still, if you want the newest and most powerful OnePlus phones, you'll be choosing between the midrange OnePlus 15R and the flagship <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-review">OnePlus 15</a>. The former costs $699, while the latter costs $899. With no 16GB RAM option for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15r-review">OnePlus 15R</a>, the gap between the midrange and flagship OnePlus phones is narrowing in 2026. If you're on the fence between these two models, here's everything you need to know about them.</p><h2 id="oneplus-15-vs-oneplus-15r-design-and-display-2">OnePlus 15 vs. OnePlus 15R: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="yESeEtUJGSg4XzkSC5wC8T" name="OnePlus 15R" alt="OnePlus 15R review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yESeEtUJGSg4XzkSC5wC8T.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Both the OnePlus 15 and OnePlus 15R use the design language introduced on last year's OnePlus 13T/S. It's kind of an iPhone clone, ditching OnePlus' iconic circular camera housing and curved design in favor of a flat, boxy chassis. To many OnePlus fans, this is a downgrade. The squircle camera arrangement and rectangular build on the OnePlus 15 and OnePlus 15R do little to differentiate these models from competitors.</p><p>From a durability standpoint, OnePlus is still an industry leader. It supports the standard IP68 water- and dust-resistance ratings we commonly see on Android phones, but adds the rarer IP69 and IP69K certifications, too. These add high-pressure and high-temperature liquid resistance in addition to protection against submersion. In layman's terms, these phones should survive a dishwasher run, though that's all in theory, and we wouldn't recommend trying it yourself.</p><p>Corning's Gorilla Glass Victus 2 covers the front of each model, but the back material varies by color. Some colorways use a plastic back, and others use a Gorilla Glass 7i back.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="8aw47pHgzdVgNWYzkrtwGN" name="OnePlus 15" alt="OnePlus 15 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8aw47pHgzdVgNWYzkrtwGN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Aligning with the new design language, the displays on the OnePlus 15 and OnePlus 15R are completely flat.

Specifically, the OnePlus 15R might have an advantage over phones like the Google Pixel 9a and the Samsung Galaxy A56, which use lesser in-house Tensor and Exynos chips. However, despite the OnePlus 15R and OnePlus 15 both using "Gen 5" processors from Qualcomm, they're not equal.</p><p>The flagship OnePlus 15 is equipped with the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, which is the successor to last generation's groundbreaking Snapdragon 8 Elite mobile platform.

There are clear hardware downgrades, and both phones lose Hasselblad image processing. However, that doesn't always mean camera quality is worse. In fact, on the OnePlus 15, we've found <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-camera-review">results that are the opposite</a>.</p><p>OnePlus launched <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-shift-from-hasselblad-official-debuts-detailmax-engine">its own DetailMax Engine</a> with the OnePlus 15, and paired with the new sensors, photo quality is generally better than the OnePlus 15. There's a trio of 50MP rear camera sensors led by the primary Sony IMX906 shooter. The telephoto camera provides 3.5x zoom natively, with up to 7x optical-quality zoom available via sensor crop.</p><p>The OnePlus 15R's camera setup is harder to defend. The primary 50MP camera is pretty good, as it uses the exact same Sony IMX906 sensor as the OnePlus 15. However, the only secondary camera is an 8MP wide-angle lens. No, you aren't imagining things — the OnePlus 13R <em>did</em> pack a 50MP telephoto lens for optical zoom, and OnePlus removed it here. That alone may make the OnePlus 15R a non-starter for some buyers.</p><h2 id="oneplus-15-vs-oneplus-15r-which-one-should-you-buy-2">OnePlus 15 vs. OnePlus 15R: Which one should you buy?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="DrbgwCR5LwkreLWBS9TfgT" name="OnePlus 15R" alt="OnePlus 15R review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DrbgwCR5LwkreLWBS9TfgT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Our review of the OnePlus 15R makes one thing clear: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15r-review">this phone isn't a good value</a>. It charges more for less, and the OnePlus 13R looks like a better choice. In fact, the perplexing downgrades and even more confusing price hike make me suspicious that the OnePlus 15R only exists to push buyers to the OnePlus 15.</p><p>With only a $200 difference separating the two models, it's easy to justify paying more for a better Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 processor, a more robust camera system with a telephoto lens, and more RAM. If that was OnePlus' goal, the company achieved it. The OnePlus 15 is assuredly the better value Android phone, making the OnePlus 15R's retail price look comically inflated.</p><p>If we pretend only the OnePlus 15 and OnePlus 15R exist, the $900 flagship takes the crown. It has the value proposition down, challenging the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL and the eventual Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra while costing less. The OnePlus 15R, however, is unfit to succeed in a budget market that includes the Google Pixel 9a — a phone that's $300 cheaper at the time of writing.</p><p>Unless you're married to OxygenOS or OnePlus hardware, the OnePlus 15R doesn't make sense in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">competitive budget Android phone</a> market. The OnePlus 15, no matter how boring, provides decent hardware while hitting a price point low enough to challenge the likes of Apple, Samsung, and Google.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="c9e8d359-a3de-4239-924c-e975132468b2">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WVTquLpEjFskiAvGdz7qTX.jpg' alt="A render of OnePlus 15R"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">OnePlus 15R</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The budget option</strong></em></p><p>If you have $600 or less to spend and need a OnePlus phone, the OnePlus 15R might be a decent option.

You search for products, compare options, add items to your cart, and go through checkout. Google's new framework, called Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP), aims to let AI agents complete all of these steps for you with a single command.</p><p>While similar capabilities have existed before, UCP standardizes the process by creating a common language that AI agents can use across different online retailers and payment providers. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/agentic-commerce-ai-tools-protocol-retailers-platforms/">Google says</a> it has partnered with major players like Shopify, Etsy, Target, Walmart, American Express, Best Buy, Flipkart, Mastercard, Stripe, and Visa to help establish the protocol.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1652px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:48.43%;"><img id="W9xvNPpZp672AX3oxfTSRZ" name="google-ucp-1" alt="Google UCP checkout flow" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/W9xvNPpZp672AX3oxfTSRZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1652" height="800" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Initially, UCP-powered checkout will appear in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-searchs-ai-mode-is-now-giving-early-access-to-select-users">AI Mode</a> within Google Search and the Gemini app in the U.S. The AI agent will be able to use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pay/google-pay-way-more-rewarding-to-shop-online-with-chrome">Google Pay</a> and automatically pass along shipping details saved in Google Wallet to place orders for you.</p><p>Google also says support for PayPal will be added soon.

And if you're feeling overwhelmed (or underwhelmed) by the choices available, I'm here to share personally-tested workout and planning apps to get you started.</p><p>Some people thrive with personalized, AI-made workout or diet plans. Others benefit from social apps like Strava where challenges and "kudos" from friends keep you motivated. And you'd be surprised how a good spreadsheet or basic workout log might work better than an expensive app with videos and plans.</p><p>Broken down into specific categories — <strong>general health/ fitness</strong> apps, <strong>workout</strong> apps, <strong>companion</strong> apps for smartwatches, and <strong>weight/ diet</strong> apps — these are the best apps to help you hit your goals for 2026, with info on key features, pricing, and why they've helped our staff succeed with <em>their</em> goals.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-general-health-fitness-apps"><span>General health & fitness apps</span></h2><h2 id="fitbit-personal-health-coach-2"><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fitbit.FitbitMobile&hl=en_US">Fitbit Personal Health Coach</a></h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3765px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KgcqBsMei7M3jTqhJSYhL7" name="Fitbit-Personal-Health-Coach-preview-08" alt="Fitbit personal health coach linking a tracked working" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KgcqBsMei7M3jTqhJSYhL7.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3765" height="2118" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="FDtMpLjuspdaCtXqmoJSW8" name="Fitbit-Personal-Health-Coach-preview-12" alt="Fitbit personal health coach Today tab focus metrics" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FDtMpLjuspdaCtXqmoJSW8.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="5tjtw6qP73Hu7JoS9P7iw7" name="Fitbit-Personal-Health-Coach-preview-11" alt="Fitbit personal health coach AI fitness suggestion" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5tjtw6qP73Hu7JoS9P7iw7.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p><strong>Key Health Features: </strong>Sleep Score, Daily Readiness Score, Stress Management Score, Menstrual Health, Meal & Water logging, Mindfulness sessions, Trend "Insights"</p><p><strong>Key Fitness Features: </strong>Active Zone Minutes, Cardio/ Target Load, Gemini-made personalized workout plans, video workouts, Fitbit/ Pixel Watch integration</p><p><strong>Subscription: </strong>$10/month or $80/year (AI plans/ analysis, video workouts, long-term reports)</p><p><strong>Why Fitbit will help with your goals:</strong> Recommending Fitbit Premium became easier once Google employed Gemini to make the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/fitbit-personal-health-coach-preview-hands-on">Fitbit Personal Health Coach</a>. It allows you to "speak" to an AI coach and create a comprehensive workout plan within minutes, incorporating dozens of different indoor or outdoor workout types. So whether your fitness goal is to lose weight, improve at a specific sport, increase muscle mass, walk more, or anything else, Gemini can give you weeks of personalized workouts for that goal. No other app is as comprehensive or customizable.</p><p>AI aside, Fitbit benefits from syncing with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fitbit">cheap Fitbit trackers</a>, so the app can track stats like resting heart rate, blood oxygen, skin temperature, sleep zones, and HRV. The new app shows "Insight" cards with trend data for these stats, so you can see how your health is improving as you try to get fitter or lose weight.</p><p><strong>Why we rely on Fitbit: </strong>"Fitbit is simple and accessible for anyone just starting out with serious workouts." <strong>— Derrek Lee, Managing Editor</strong></p><p>"I love the new interface and how simple it is to get important data at a glance. I've been impressed with the AI coach and its recommendations.

But they're usually (A) paid, (B) mobile-only, and (C) specialized to one activity.</p><p>That's why, when it comes to New Year's resolutions or making a workout calendar, a simple document or spreadsheet works better than trying to find the perfect, all-in-one app! Use <em>other</em> apps to track specific goals like miles/ steps/ weight loss/ books read, but consolidate them all into one document you can check on your phone <em>or</em> computer, using tables and drop-down menus to label your progress (as I did above).</p><p>Or, use a spreadsheet to lay out your long-term workout plans, then a specific running or strength app to put those plans into action. I used that method to plan my months-long <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/choosing-the-best-marathon-training-smartwatch-for-my-upcoming-garmin-marathon">marathon training</a> (see above), paired with my Garmin watch, and it was highly effective.</p><p><strong>Why we rely on Google Docs/ Sheets: </strong>"Yeah, it sounds silly, but I actually found a use for spreadsheets. I need upper body strength, so lifting weights is the way I try to maintain it. I can keep record of my current routine as well as any goals, and there is plenty of room for extra notes. Best of all, I can check off each day's workout from my phone or my desktop and have access to all my long-term progress, so I feel like I'm accomplishing something." <strong>— Jerry Hildenbrand, Senior Editor</strong></p><h2 id="strava-2"><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.strava&hl=en_US">Strava</a></h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eidmzxBKfN5ni6cGkzTgt8" name="strava-athlete-intelligence-screenshots" alt="Screenshots showing Strava's Athlete Intelligence: Left - an LLM summary of the athlete's half-marathon run and comparative effort to past runs; center: an LLM summary of how their pace compares to past runs above pace stats; right: an LLM summary of the runner's most common HR zone and the intensity of the workout above a HR chart." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eidmzxBKfN5ni6cGkzTgt8.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DmS3DofztTzG4Ch28LzRhe" name="Strava-run.jpg" alt="Strava run tracking" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DmS3DofztTzG4Ch28LzRhe.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2711px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="PGAe6YaYgR7vyYcXeuMH8X" name="Strava-Performance-Predictions" alt="The Strava app on the Pixel 9a display, showing Performance Prediction times for the author's current condition for 5K, 10K, half marathon, and full marathon races." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PGAe6YaYgR7vyYcXeuMH8X.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2711" height="1524" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p><strong>Key Fitness Features:</strong> Activity recording, local routes with 3D maps, Heatmap, Segment leaderboards, Clubs, Challenges, long-term workout analysis, Athlete Intelligence summaries, race predictions, Instant Workouts</p><p><strong>Subscription: </strong>$12/month or $80/year (Saved routes, full data analysis with AI summaries, Instant Workouts</p><p><strong>Why Strava will help with your goals:</strong> Most people try harder when cheered on or competing with others. Strava lets you connect with friends to offer and receive "kudos," motivating you to keep getting out there. You also have "Challenges" where hitting certain thresholds nets you badges and awards from partner companies, and leaderboards where you can compete to be fastest on local routes and trails. And it helps you find local Clubs with like-minded athletes, if you need in-person motivation.</p><p>More recently, Strava has doubled down on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/strava-interview-athlete-intelligence-inaccurate-gps-race-leaderboards-and-more">Athlete Intelligence</a>, a tool that utilizes your workout history to assess the quality of a <em>specific</em> workout and provide context for your improvement over time. This year, Strava launched "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/strava-challenges-garmin-and-fitbit-with-personalized-instant-workouts">Instant Workouts</a>," with personalized activities across 40 sports types and four types (‘Maintain’, ‘Build’, ‘Explore’, or ‘Recover’), including custom routes from your starting location using a Heatmap of other users' workouts. Essentially, Strava offers personalized, tailored workouts, without committing to a long-term plan.</p><p><strong>Why we rely on Strava: </strong>"I found my local running group through Strava last year; I appreciate when Strava tells me a certain activity was my fastest in the last month; and I'm motivated to become the 'Local Legend' for certain segments like my nearby track." <strong>— Michael Hicks, Wearables Editor</strong></p><p>"Strava is a great app to connect with others who are into fitness and keep yourself accountable.

One feature that stands out is what the user says is called "Bixby Live." If that sounds familiar (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/gemini-live-pixel-9-pro-grocery-list">Gemini Live</a>), that's because the feature works pretty similarly to Google's version, at least, in this early discovery.</p><p>When activated, it seems that Bixby Live will run a multi-colored strip along the edges of your phone's display. The center will house a circle, likely just indicating the AI's presence. At the bottom, the AI will be "listening," as well as options to mute your mic, share your camera, and upload content.</p><p>As SamMobile points out, the drop menu is purportedly signaling "conversational styles" for Bixby. Styles such as general agent, tour guide, storyteller, interview, and more.</p><p>AI generation capabilities for Bixby were spotted, as one of the Redditor's screenshots showcases a "content above was generated by AI" disclaimer. Two additional purported glimpses show off Bixby's chatting experience: one that's its main app and the other that's off the home screen. Regarding the former, it seems that users fully engaging with Bixby's app can experience a chat thread similar to what you'd get from Gemini. It even mentions "Circle to Ask," a feature that sounds incredibly similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>.</p><p>The other option for chatting with Bixby is a simple, semi-transparent window that appears for quick queries on your device.</p><h2 id="bixby-s-looking-to-catch-up-2">Bixby's looking to catch up</h2><blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oneui/comments/1q7ncc2/one_ui_85_bixby_integration_with_perplexity">One UI 8.5 Bixby integration with Perplexity & Deepseek adds Bixby Live, Circle to Ask, AI generation and more</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oneui">r/oneui</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><p>These supposed changes for Bixby were found in Samsung's One UI 8.5 test; however, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/samsung-bixby-still-hanging-on-as-rumor-says-theres-more-to-come">early signs were hinted at</a> back in October. A social media post highlighted that Samsung was experimenting with a new Bixby pop-up bar when summoned on a Galaxy device. The bar would adhere to your Light or Dark mode choice and feature a colorful blue/purple color scheme around its edges.</p><p>It definitely gives a more Gemini-esque feel to the otherwise plain and under-the-radar AI.</p><p>On a more substantial note, Samsung was recently spotted testing its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-testing-perplexity-inside-bixby-for-galaxy-s26">Perplexity AI integration</a> with Bixby. A report notes that the company was testing the AI's responses for queries given to Bixby, furthering suspicions around its potential upgrades for the full One UI 8.5 release. More than that, leaks indicate that Bixby could handle basic tasks, while Perplexity's intelligence comes in for "complex, web-backed" questions.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The Galaxy Z Fold 8 might end up getting this creaseless panel that was shown off at CES this year. Android Central's Senior Editor Harish Jonnalagadda was able to compare the "reference device" — what looks to be a current-gen foldable — and the upcoming panel that seemingly looks to be creaseless. Some people even speculate that this creaseless screen will debut on Apple's rumored book-style foldable set to launch this year. <br><br>Jonnalagadda says that Samsung didn't indicate whether this panel would end up on the Galaxy Z Fold 8, but it is entirely likely that it will be the case, considering it showcased the tri-folding panels at MWC last year, and we saw it on the Galaxy Z Trifold this year.</p><h2 id="motorola-entered-ces-this-year-with-the-most-flex-2">Motorola entered CES this year with the most flex</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nbUSzgFLRPoKhTtk7eGXeH" name="Motorola Razr Fold" alt="Motorola Razr Fold hands-on testing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nbUSzgFLRPoKhTtk7eGXeH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/meet-the-razr-fold-ces-launch"><strong>here</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/unveiling-the-motorola-signature-launches-ces-2026"><strong>here</strong></a></p><p>Motorola outdid itself at CES this year, unveiling a whole slew of devices, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-fold-first-impressions">Motorola Razr Fold</a>. The phone shows up with a 6.6-inch cover display like any other device, but unfolds into a massive 8.1-inch 2K LTPO display that lets the user juggle between work, creativity, and play. Motorola didn't reveal much about the device's dimensions, chipset, or other internal specs, like the RAM and battery.</p><p>The Motorola Razr Fold features an advanced triple rear camera system consisting of a 50MP Sony LYTIA main sensor, a 50MP ultrawide/macro lens, and a 50MP 3x periscope telephoto lens. It also gets two selfie cameras, a 32MP external camera, and a 20MP punch hole camera on its internal screen, for when the device is unfolded.</p><p>Next up is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-signature-hands-on">Motorola Signature</a>, which is an ultra-slim device, featuring a Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 processor, 50MP cameras, and a remarkable 5,200mAh battery—all encased in a sleek design, starting at €999, and is the first phone that is said to get upto seven years of software updates.</p><p>Other than these phones, the company also<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/moto-things-hits-the-new-year-with-an-ultra-stylus-for-the-razr-fold-at-ces-2026"> unveiled a trio of innovative accessories</a>, including the Pen Ultra stylus for its Razr Fold, a feature-rich <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-used-the-moto-watch-and-im-glad-motorola-ditched-wear-os">Moto Watch</a> partnered with Polar, and the Moto Tag 2 tracker, promising to redefine user experience and convenience.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6qW8tV5W34zNPX3HP2Vs7S" name="Motorola Signature" alt="Motorola Signature hands-on testing at Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6qW8tV5W34zNPX3HP2Vs7S.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="galaxy-s26-leaks-keep-leaking-with-rumors-of-a-feb-launch-2">Galaxy S26 leaks keep leaking, with rumors of a Feb launch</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1420px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ker5PtDTkGfwSJGxz2a8jW" name="galaxy-s26-ultra-renders-3" alt="Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ker5PtDTkGfwSJGxz2a8jW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1420" height="799" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-launch-date-reliable-leaker-confirms"><strong>here </strong></a><strong>and </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-galaxy-s26-ultra-may-revolutionize-charging-with-new-60w-system-heres-the-scoop"><strong>here</strong></a></p><p>Samsung's next flagship series has been showing up in multiple leaks recently, and for good reason, considering it's due to launch sometime next month.

This week, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://press.strava.com/articles/strava-launches-new-instant-workouts-feature-worldwide-to-provide">Strava Instant Workouts</a> has arrived to fulfill that ambition.</p><p>The feature is quite straightforward: Every week, Strava's algorithm will analyze your recent activities and create a series of sample workouts tailored to your abilities.</p><p>You can choose to "maintain" your current average pace or distance, "build" your fitness by going further than usual, "explore" new sports types, or "recover" with easier workouts. Each category will have a few workout cards you can select, showing you more details about the pace and route.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2248px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="oDiL2yFhkWy3NWYunFXGeN" name="Strava-GPS-Heatmap-Instant-Workout" alt="Screenshot of Strava Instant Workout feature creating a suggested route for a run based on your location and nearby Heatmap." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oDiL2yFhkWy3NWYunFXGeN.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2248" height="1265" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Strava)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Strava began beta-testing this feature with running and weight training in November — and claims users expressed 85% satisfaction with it — but has now expanded the feature to over 40 sports.</p><p>Strava's Athlete Intelligence will label each workouts as easy, moderate, or hard, as well as provide a "rationale of the benefits to that type of workout."</p><p>For outdoor activities, Strava will auto-generate a potential route based on its Heatmap, which tracks where other users traditionally like to run. Whether you're unfamiliar with an area or just crave something new, this feature sounds genuinely helpful, and you can save the route afterward.</p><p>Of course, to follow this route, you'll either need to use the Strava app during the activity or push the route to your smartwatch. Strava says that "the ability to send workouts to your Garmin or Apple device and improved step-by-step guidance" will arrive in the coming weeks and months."</p><p>In the past year, Strava acquired two apps with long-term training plans for runners (Runna) and cyclists (The Breakaway), but Instant Workouts is the first instance of Strava making personalized workouts available to its own subscribers.</p><h2 id="how-strava-instant-workouts-compare-to-garmin-connect-fitbit-and-other-workout-apps-2">How Strava Instant Workouts compare to Garmin Connect, Fitbit, and other workout apps</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3862px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="UZ5CetPRUTvSYNKGGNFRKQ" name="Garmin-Venu-4-review-25" alt="Garmin Venu 4 morning report suggested workout" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UZ5CetPRUTvSYNKGGNFRKQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3862" height="2172" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'm planning to test out Strava's Instant Workouts in the coming weeks, to see how useful and unique they are. On paper, they're a fascinating alternative to options like Garmin's daily suggested workouts — though not long-term plans like Garmin Coach, TrainingPeaks, or Strava's own Runna plans.</p><p>Garmin's daily suggestions for runners or cyclists rely on training load focus data, pushing you to do more low-aerobic or anaerobic workouts to sustain a good chronic load. Strava is counting on athletes to decide for themselves when they need to push harder, ease off, or maintain, with more suggestions at any given moment.</p><p>Garmin has only recently expanded its workout suggestions to indoor strength training on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-venu-4-review">Venu 4</a>, and it's worth noting that only <em>some</em> Garmin watches have suggestions in general. Strava's workouts target a wider variety of sports, and even if you can only "push" them to Apple and Garmin watches, you could easily recreate "run 3 miles in 30 minutes" on your own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watch</a>.</p><p>As a side note, I'm curious to see how well Strava's Heatmap-generated routes work. Garmin's own Trendline Popularity routing has never built especially <em>useful</em> or <em>intelligent</em> courses for me; I've always tended to make my own routes, if I use them at all.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="imq2f8NiUMqSknzNtffshN" name="Fitbit-Premium-Health-Coach-workout-plan" alt="A photo of the Google Pixel Watch 4 sitting next to a Pixel 9a open to the Fitbit app, showing the Fitbit Premium Health Coach preview with the Fitness tab open; it shows a customized workout plan with three upcoming runs." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/imq2f8NiUMqSknzNtffshN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's also worth comparing Strava Instant Workouts to the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/fitbit-personal-health-coach-preview-hands-on">Fitbit Personal Health Coach</a>, which creates custom workout suggestions across a couple dozen sports modes.</p><p>Currently in a public preview, the new Fitbit app has you speak to an LLM "coach" about your workout goals, at which point it auto-generates a week of workouts at a time. You only see one per day, but you can always "adjust plan" and change your specific workout for the day.</p><p>Fitbit doesn't have a Heatmap GPS equivalent, but its "AI" analysis is attempting something similar to Strava's Athlete Intelligence, except designed to be more of a conversation instead of Strava's per-workout summaries.</p><p>Ultimately, it's no surprise that Strava challenged other apps with its own personalized workouts. It knew it needed to be more "forward-looking" and offer more coaching value to keep its subscribers happy. And its Instant Workouts" are well-suited to Strava users, who won't want to be tied to a specific device or have to build and stick to a long-term workout plan. Always-available, tailored workouts on your phone will be more compelling to casual athletes.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> was a good starting point to get the form factor on my radar, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">OPPO Find N5</a> thoroughly impressed me with its great design and build quality.

These two phones were recently announced, and one is already available in a few markets. To my surprise, both phones have me giving book-style foldables another look, and I'm very tempted to give up my allegiance to flip phones. However, the Razr Fold and Galaxy Z TriFold are tempting me for very different reasons.</p><h2 id="the-razr-fold-is-a-chance-for-motorola-to-play-one-of-its-biggest-strengths-2">The Razr Fold is a chance for Motorola to play one of its biggest strengths</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="meN8TCuFJD5PTgg6TegqAH" name="Motorola Razr Fold" alt="Motorola Razr Fold hands-on testing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/meN8TCuFJD5PTgg6TegqAH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For years, Motorola was largely seen as the go-to budget brand, and it still is to some extent to this day.

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-2023-review">Motorola Edge Plus 2023</a> was a great example of this, offering flagship specs that rivaled (and in some ways bested) the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-plus-review">Galaxy S23 Plus</a> but for hundreds less.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="jxsAXHjBz9abn2U6ZYNdm9" name="Motorola-edge-plus-2023-hands-on-display-04.jpg" alt="Hands-on with the Motorola Edge+ (2023)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jxsAXHjBz9abn2U6ZYNdm9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I expect Motorola to apply the same ethos to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-fold">Razr Fold</a>. Foldable phones are already quite pricey, with Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> actually costing more than its predecessor, hitting a whopping $2,000.

While Motorola has yet to officially provide any pricing details, that would already undercut most new book-style foldables, which often start at $1,800 in the U.S. Even with the potential concern over losing a major U.S. carrier, that's still an attractive price.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Some good news and bad news regarding Moto.

And part of the appeal of flip phones is that they're cheaper than book-style foldables. The company still offers one of the most affordable flip phones around with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-review">Razr 2025</a>, which is arguably a better deal than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-fe-review">Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE</a>.</p><p>With the Razr Fold, it can do the same, undercut its rivals, and offer something a little easier on the wallet.</p><p>Plus, Motorola still has arguably the best overall flip phone experience, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/24-hours-using-only-the-motorola-razr-and-galaxy-z-flip-cover-screens">utilizing the cover screen</a> in a way that others can't or won't emulate.

They offer a unique ability to be used as a traditional phone with the added advantage of opening up to a "tablet-like" experience with a much larger display. However, they usually measure a meager 8 inches and have a more square aspect ratio, which doesn't exactly scream "tablet."</p><p>That's not to say the larger displays on these foldables aren't useful, but the experience still feels confined compared to a traditional <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablet</a>.</p><p>As a remedy to this shortcoming, the Galaxy Z TriFold takes that concept and runs with it, opening up to a full 10-inch display. This size is on the lower end of most tablets, which are often 10 or 11 inches, while still providing a more tablet-like aspect ratio that we don't see on bi-fold foldables. The result is a more versatile experience that should proove more useful.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FFpW8jePa3ds2kPTRSVJf6" name="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FFpW8jePa3ds2kPTRSVJf6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung also took it further by letting the TriFold run a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-phones/the-samsung-galaxy-z-trifolds-best-feature-wont-be-its-hardware-heres-why-im-more-excited-for-dex">standalone DeX mode</a>, meaning you won't need an external display to make it work, just like on its tablets. Unlike the standard One UI experience, this offers a more desktop-like feel, letting users freely adjust windows and run apps side-by-side without the limitations of the typical mobile experience.</p><p>It also means running up to 20 apps across several desktop workspaces, making the Galaxy Z TriFold the ultimate multitasking machine. Essentially, you can think of it as a medium between a smartphone and tablet experience, blending the two in a way that seems fitting for such a device.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BKzZgQjzDX32QuyKAN7tGQ" name="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold hands-on testing at Dubai Mall on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BKzZgQjzDX32QuyKAN7tGQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Of course, the downside here is that the Galaxy Z TriFold doesn't come cheap.

Pull it out the next time your friends are showing off their fancy new flagships and I guarantee no one will notice the difference.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

According to the digital data company's analytics, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-gemini-now-integrates-seamlessly-with-notebooklm-for-improved-project-management">Google's Gemini</a> has reached 21.5% of the traffic share as of January 2, 2026. What's leading the race? OpenAI's ChatGPT with 64.5% of the traffic share. There's one clear fact here, per Similarweb's data: ChatGPT and Gemini are the "top dogs," one might say, for traffic.</p><p>Among the many AI names, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chatgpt-scheduled-tasks-beta-rollout">ChatGPT</a> and Gemini account for ~86% of the traffic. The remaining 14% is divvied up between DeepSeek, X's Grok, Perplexity, Claude, and Microsoft's Copilot (in order).</p><p>Even when we get down into AI tools traffic, ChatGPT and Gemini still lead the pack, though the former holds the majority.</p><p>What's interesting about where Gemini is now is that it's been gaining ground (slowly, but surely) over the past few months. In actuality, it's been a trend all throughout 2025. Similarweb's timeline shows how Gemini's traffic share has been slowly rising, going from 5.7% a year ago to 18.2% in December 2025.</p><h2 id="gemini-v-chatgpt-2">Gemini v.

Here's the thing: everyone was playing catch-up. While most companies are still playing catch-up, Gemini's doing so at a seemingly faster rate, at least, per the data.</p><p>Google and OpenAI aren't slowing down one bit, as the former introduced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/gemini-set-to-transform-your-google-tv">Gemini features for its TV service</a>, turning it into another companion.

There are two huge talking points here, so things kick off with Lock Glimpse, as Nothing is removing the feature entirely. The post states that the feature will disappear from the Nothing Phone a Series, except for the Lite.</p><p>Nothing says it has made the decision "based on feedback" and that it will only return Lock Glimpse to devices "once it’s meaningfully improved to feel less intrusive and more considered."</p><p>The other major side of this Friday update is bloatware. Nothing states users can now "fully remove" the Meta App Installer, Meta App Manager, and Meta Service from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothings-3a-lite-debuts">Phone 3a lite</a>. Entering the setting's page for the app and tapping "Disable" is how you get the ball rolling. After disabling, Nothing says your device will prompt you to restart. It adds that once this reboot concludes, "all Meta services are removed from the system partition."</p><p>The post notes that if you factory reset your device, these Meta services will return.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Yqq6GBoLLFEM9fJtcw8ZB6" name="Nothing Phone 3a Lite" alt="Nothing Phone 3a Lite" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Yqq6GBoLLFEM9fJtcw8ZB6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nothing)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Lastly, Nothing is adding "app recommendations." This feature is stated to be a part of your device's setup experience; however, it may also appear "after certain updates." The post says that users can easily dismiss these notifications by swiping them away. A more permanent fix would be to disable it completely: <strong>Settings > Apps > All apps > Top-right icon > Show system > App Services > Disable</strong>.</p><p>These recommendations are headed for Nothing Phone a Series and CMF phones.

Nothing faced backlash over its OS 4.0 software after users discovered instances of bloatware, such as Meta App Installer, Meta App Manager, and Meta Services. The company highlighted that it previously only let users disable such apps, but offering a true removal option is exactly what users were chasing.</p><p>This was something Nothing alluded to during the Open Beta, stating that it would pre-install "partner apps and services" to help its BOM costs (Bill of Materials).

Fortunately, many of the best wireless carriers in the biz run special limited time offers this time of year, and the Verizon-owned Visible Wireless is no exception.</p><p>Sign up today <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.visible.com/plans/"><strong>with the promo code SWITCH26 at checkout and you could save up to $12 per month for 26 months. </strong></a>That may not sound like a lot, but Visible's plans were already pretty affordable, so this deal could seriously alter the way you view your phone bill in 2026 (and beyond). Let's break it all down so you can see what I mean.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="885dfb4a-4466-4ef7-ae44-271f8e25e9aa" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Join Visible Wireless with code SWITCH26 and save up to $12 per month for 26 months" data-dimension48="Join Visible Wireless with code SWITCH26 and save up to $12 per month for 26 months" href="https://www.visible.com/plans" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="4qWcdh4qZdRALixjzrAwhJ" name="visible logo square 1000x1000.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4qWcdh4qZdRALixjzrAwhJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><a href="https://www.visible.com/plans" data-dimension112="885dfb4a-4466-4ef7-ae44-271f8e25e9aa" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Join Visible Wireless with code SWITCH26 and save up to $12 per month for 26 months" data-dimension48="Join Visible Wireless with code SWITCH26 and save up to $12 per month for 26 months" data-dimension25=""><strong>Join Visible Wireless with code SWITCH26 and save up to $12 per month for 26 months</strong></a></p><p>Sign up for <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/visible-review">Visible Wireless</a> with the code SWITCH26 at checkout and you could get over two years of unlimited talk, text, and data on Verizon's excellent 5G network for as little as 19 bucks per month. It's as simple as that. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.visible.com/plans" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="885dfb4a-4466-4ef7-ae44-271f8e25e9aa" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Join Visible Wireless with code SWITCH26 and save up to $12 per month for 26 months" data-dimension48="Join Visible Wireless with code SWITCH26 and save up to $12 per month for 26 months" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p>Although it's not <em>technically </em>an MVNO, I still consider Visible Wireless to be one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-mvno-carrier">best prepaid carriers</a> in the business, thanks to the company's straightforward plan system and the fact that it operates using Verizon's 5G network. </p><p>The carrier offers three plan options starting at the Basic Visible plan (usually $25 per month) and going up to the comprehensive Visible Plus Pro plan ($45 per month without the deal). Using the code <strong>SWITCH26</strong> at checkout knocks $6, $9, and $12 off the Visible Basic, Visible Plus, and Visible Plus Pro plans, respectively, and the deal locks in the discounted rate for over two years with no hidden fees whatsoever.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:60.06%;"><img id="JkuSbrcywuPuEMZnMT9R8Z" name="visivle-app-on-phone.jpg" alt="Visible app on phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JkuSbrcywuPuEMZnMT9R8Z.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1230" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In other words, if you use the deal to save $12 per month on the Visible Plus Pro plan, you're basically getting six months of Verizon-powered wireless for FREE across 26 months. That plan also gives you unlimited premium data on Verizon's Ultra Wideband network, an unlimited mobile hotspot, and uncapped coverage to over 85 countries worldwide.</p><p>Even if you go with one of the Visible's less comprehensive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/best-unlimited-data-plans">data plans</a>, you'll still get unlimited talk, text, and data on Verizon's legendary network, a free mobile hotspot, discounts on home internet, and much more.</p><h2 id="why-should-i-switch-to-visible-2">Why should I switch to Visible?</h2><p>Visible Wireless is unique in that it offers the convenience and flexibility of a prepaid carrier with the support and coverage of a Big Three provider. There are only three straightforward plans to choose from, and all three offer unlimited talk, text, and data on Verizon's vast 5G network. There are no hidden fees to worry about, unlimited hotspot data is a given, and the fact that Verizon owns and operates the carrier means that de-prioritization is uncommon.</p><h2 id="does-visible-wireless-have-a-free-trial-2">Does Visible Wireless have a free trial?</h2><p>Yes! Visible Wireless offers <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.visible.com/free-trial"><strong>a 15-day free trial</strong></a> that lets you explore the ins and outs of its service with zero hassle or commitment. You can even run it directly alongside your existing phone plan without any interruptions. </p><h2 id="does-visible-wireless-sell-smartphones-2">Does Visible Wireless sell smartphones?</h2><p>Yep! Although I don't love its phone deals as much as the offerings from, say, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/mint-mobile-review">Mint Mobile</a>, Visible Wireless does run occasional phone deals throughout the year that get you the latest Android devices for cheap (or even free) if you play your cards right. </p><ul><li><strong>MVNO deals: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/"><u><strong>Mint Mobile</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.visible.com/plans/"><u><strong>Visible</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://deals.boostmobile.com/mypromo/trial-mybm"><u><strong>Boost</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://tello.com/buy/custom_plans"><u><strong>Tello</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.cricketwireless.com/cell-phone-plans"><u><strong>Cricket</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>
