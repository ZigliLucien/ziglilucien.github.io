If you’re looking to get something on the upper end of the scale, the decision comes down to the Samsung Galaxy Watch 2025 vs. Galaxy Watch 8 Classic.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch 2025 is a slightly upgraded version of Samsung’s first rugged smartwatch model launched in summer 2024, while the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic is the larger, highest-end version in the new standard line. The question becomes: is the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025 worth the extra coin? Let’s find out.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-2025-vs-galaxy-watch-8-classic-design-and-durability-2">Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025 vs. Galaxy Watch 8 Classic: Design and durability</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2339px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="u5V5nbUKvbDVV4ZVc9WNRG" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-watch-ultra-2-hands-on-18" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra (2025) hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/u5V5nbUKvbDVV4ZVc9WNRG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2339" height="1316" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>First, let’s look at, well, looks. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-2">Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025</a> is the largest Samsung Galaxy smartwatch, thicker than the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic. But it also happens to be a smidge lighter. Both have three buttons, including a Quick Button for accessing frequently used options.</p><p>The biggest difference is that the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra has a digital-only bezel, whereas the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic adds a rotating bezel. Considering Andrew Myrick notes in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-hands-on">his initial Galaxy Watch 8 hands-on </a>that the rotating bezel is his favorite way of interacting with a smartwatch, this will be a big deal for a lot of people like him.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="Lc534fRH3LBgUxe4U3wDNG" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-watch-ultra-2-hands-on-26" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra (2025) on wrist hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Lc534fRH3LBgUxe4U3wDNG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025 comes in four titanium finishes: Silver, Gray, White, and a new one: Blue. It has a large 1.5-inch AMOLED screen housed in a squircle design that affords up to 3,000 nits peak brightness. The screen is made from sapphire crystal, and the watch itself is as rugged as they come, meeting an IP68 and an impressive 10ATM rating as well as MIL-STD-810H standards for durability.</p><p>In terms of battery life, it has a 590mAh battery, the same as the previous generation model, which means it should last about four days in power savings mode, about two with frequent workout tracking, and more.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="YhUq95hTSJW3UAhbpTAWS4" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-Gemini-calendar-entry" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic showing the Gemini app creating a Google Calendar entry for the movie Superman." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YhUq95hTSJW3UAhbpTAWS4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic showing the Gemini app creating a Google Calendar entry for the movie Superman. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>By comparison, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic comes in basic Black or White, though you can spruce it up with various band types (sport, fabric, or hybrid as well as third-party options). It employs a thin and cushioned design that has been brought over from the original Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra.</p><p>This squircle design change is immediately noticeable, and Myrick notes that it’s one that grew on him after he became accustomed to it with last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> after wearing that model for a while. As noted, along with the Dynamic Lug System, the big differentiator is the inclusion of a handy rotating bezel on this watch.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic has a smaller 1.34-inch Super AMOLED sapphire crystal display with the same 3,000 nits peak brightness. It boasts both IP68 and MIL-STD-810H certification, but it isn’t quite as water-resistant for deep diving with “only” a 5ATM rating.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Lg9jvE5kBqe73qpmf2RTSE" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-custom-Tile" alt="A custom "Morning" Tile on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic showing alarm and reminder info" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Lg9jvE5kBqe73qpmf2RTSE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Galaxy Watch 8 Classic. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The battery is also smaller at 445mAh, and while Samsung doesn’t note its rated battery life, you can expect to charge it at least every day or two if it falls in line with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review" target="_blank">Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 Classic</a>, which has a slightly smaller battery.</p><p>There’s an LTE option with both watches as well as Bluetooth 5.3 and NFC for tap payments. While the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025 is more expensive, there are trade-in deals with older model Samsung Galaxy Watches (not the Galaxy Watch Ultra 2024 at the time of this writing) that can save you a few bucks.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-2025-vs-galaxy-watch-8-classic-specs-2">Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025 vs. Galaxy Watch 8 Classic: Specs</h2><p>Let’s look at how these two smartwatches compare when it comes to basic specs.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025</strong></p></th><th  ><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic</strong></p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Compatibility</p></td><td  ><p>Android 11.0 or higher</p></td><td  ><p>Android 11.0 or higher</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>Wear OS 6 (powered by Samsung) + Samsung One UI 6 </p></td><td  ><p>Wear OS 6 (powered by Samsung) + Samsung One UI 6 </p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Titanium Silver, Gray, White, Blue</p></td><td  ><p>Titanium Black, White</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Swappable Band</p></td><td  ><p>Yes</p></td><td  ><p>Yes</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>590mAh</p></td><td  ><p>445mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery Life</p></td><td  ><p>Approx. 4 days in power-saving mode, up to 2 days with heavier use</p></td><td  ><p>Approx. up to 2 days</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>App</p></td><td  ><p>Samsung Health</p></td><td  ><p>Samsung Health</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Heart Rate Tracking</p></td><td  ><p>Yes</p></td><td  ><p>Yes</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Stress Tracking</p></td><td  ><p>Yes</p></td><td  ><p>Yes</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Blood Oxygen</p></td><td  ><p>Yes</p></td><td  ><p>Yes</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>GPS</p></td><td  ><p>Yes (built-in)</p></td><td  ><p>Yes (built-in)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Sleep Monitoring</p></td><td  ><p>Yes</p></td><td  ><p>Yes</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Water Resistance</p></td><td  ><p>10ATM, IP68</p></td><td  ><p>5ATM, IP68</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Mobile Pay</p></td><td  ><p>Samsung Wallet</p></td><td  ><p>Samsung Wallet</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>64GB</p></td><td  ><p>64GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Screen Size</p></td><td  ><p>1.5 inches</p></td><td  ><p>1.34 inches</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Screen Type</p></td><td  ><p>AMOLED</p></td><td  ><p>Super AMOLED</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Screen Resolution</p></td><td  ><p>480 x 480</p></td><td  ><p>438 x 438</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Peak Brightness</p></td><td  ><p>3,000 nits</p></td><td  ><p>3,000 nits</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>47.4 x 47.1 x 12.1mm </p></td><td  ><p>46 x 46.4 x 10.6mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>60.5 grams</p></td><td  ><p>63.5 grams</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-2025-vs-galaxy-watch-8-classic-health-wellness-and-smarts-2">Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025 vs. Galaxy Watch 8 Classic: Health, wellness, and smarts</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jXeftT7x2icLjEGWB5qB9L" name="Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-2025-1" alt="Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jXeftT7x2icLjEGWB5qB9L.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Galaxy Watch 8 Ultra 2025. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When it comes to the internals of these two smartwatches, what they can track and what you can do with them are pretty much identical. Both run on an Exynos W1000 processor and come loaded with Wear OS 6. Both have 64GB storage (that’s double that of the 2024 edition of the Galaxy Watch Ultra) and 2GB RAM.</p><p>Both track all the usual suspects when it comes to health, wellness, and vitals, thanks to the inclusion of a Samsung BioActive sensor. This includes workouts, calorie burn, activity levels, sleep, stress, temperature, heart rate, blood oxygen, and more. They offer tailored sleep coaching, an area where Samsung has been upping the ante. This includes the ability to detect moderate to severe signs of sleep apnea.</p><p>There’s also Vascular Load tracking, which monitors your stress levels during sleep, and Antioxidant Index to measure your carotenoid levels. These relate to dietary intake and metabolism, and the data can help you make more informed lifestyle choices.</p><p>To use the latter, you need to remove the watch and place your finger on the underside sensor, which isn’t ideal, but it’s worth doing if cartenoid level measurements are important to you. High Stress Alerts will ping you if either watch notices your stress levels are too high, prompting you to take a breath. There’s also a mindfulness tracker and energy score.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="7VFuKoMtoPG68CouS2yfXE" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-Basic-Tile" alt="The "Basic" Tile on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic showing Weather, Calendar, and part of the Battery widget" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7VFuKoMtoPG68CouS2yfXE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The "Basic" Tile on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic showing Weather, Calendar, and part of the Battery widget. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Runners will love the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-running-coach-galaxy-watch-8-is-cool-idea-held-back-by-hardware-and-execution">Running Coach</a>, which calculates your fitness level on a scale from one to 10 and delivers a customized and personalized training plan with real-time guidance and motivational insights to help you along on your journey. Using Together, you can also challenge friends and family for further motivation. Both also incorporate dual-frequency GPS for tracking your runs, hikes, walks, cycles, and other outdoor activities.</p><p>One big update with both the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra and Galaxy Watch 8 Classic is the inclusion of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google Gemini</a> out of the box, replacing the outdated Google Assistant smart voice assistant. With this, you can summon Gemini with natural voice commands, whether that’s to initiate a workout, check on your calendar, or simply ask questions about what’s going on around you. Samsung worked closely with Google to ensure that there’s seamless integration with its first-party Wear OS apps.</p><p>Speaking of which, you can also keep on top of things by leveraging the multi-info tiles and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-set-up-use-now-bar-samsung-galaxy-phone">Now Bar</a>, which keeps your most crucial notifications front and center.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-2025-vs-galaxy-watch-8-classic-which-should-you-choose-2">Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025 vs. Galaxy Watch 8 Classic: Which should you choose?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="yaBAzKc6XNGPRnjcjqAYTG" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-watch-ultra-2-hands-on-24" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra (2025) next to Watch 8 Classic hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yaBAzKc6XNGPRnjcjqAYTG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025 (right) next to Watch 8 Classic (left). </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The decision between the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025 vs. Galaxy Watch 8 Classic really comes down to your personal needs and budget. But even if you have the bucks to spare, is the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025 worth it?</p><p>Let’s consider your biggest upgrades with that model compared to the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic. It’s lighter but also thicker, has a larger display, longer battery life, and is more durable. It’s really designed to be the adventurer’s watch. So, if you’re the type of person who participates in a lot of outdoor sports, especially underwater activities, you’ll find value in it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="o7rPpwAjeMWuGzc5rjP7EE" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-Health-Tile" alt="The Health Tile on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic showing ECG and antioxidant index" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o7rPpwAjeMWuGzc5rjP7EE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The extra battery life is appreciated as well, but if you are already used to charging your smartwatch every day or two, you might be used to that routine anyway. With that said, longer battery life is always appreciated, especially on those days when you’re at 2% right before you’re about to go for a run.</p><p>Design and feature-wise, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic, as well as its smaller Galaxy Watch 8 sister, is starting to look more like an Ultra model anyway, with the same cushioned and squircle design. However, there’s a key advantage with the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic to keep in mind if you would use it: the rotating bezel.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="NMobxtNkLuvh7rQkVAeaSG" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-watch-ultra-2-hands-on-19" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra (2025) hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NMobxtNkLuvh7rQkVAeaSG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1407" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We haven’t yet tested the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025 but based on Michael Hicks’ review of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> (2024 model), if the iterative update offers even slight improvements, it won’t disappoint. He calls that model “a great smartwatch that’s enjoyable to use,” applauding how powerful and reliable it is. We also named the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra among <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-waterproof-smartwatches">the best waterproof smartwatches</a> you can buy, and chances are the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025 will take its spot on the list.</p><p>Interestingly, Hicks said last year that the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra falls between casual and serious users. Given this, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic is even more skewed to the casual side, but with all the same features serious users will appreciate, minus the extra battery life and durability, and with a cool rotating bezel. It’s the more elegant-looking of the two watches without sacrificing too much. So, it will likely be the preference for most users.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2766px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NmCkQeqkBb8gdoDpyGNGsZ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-display" alt="A close-up of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic showing the default watch face, display border, and rotating bezel." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NmCkQeqkBb8gdoDpyGNGsZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2766" height="1556" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Bottom line: if you have an older model to trade in and it brings the price of the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025 in line with the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic, it’s worth considering. But it’s not necessary for most people unless you’re heavy into water and other outdoor sports, or you’re a power user where every last minute of battery life counts. The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic is a lovely medium that affords all the same features at a more affordable price and with a similar yet more stylish design.</p><p>If you want something smaller, consider the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8. If you already have the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra (2024), don’t bother upgrading just yet. It’s not a big enough jump in features to warrant it.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="daa7d483-4899-4f3c-9eab-beba42584e7f">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/S9QYyvUty8JP4cTFKaTMJN.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Only if you need it</strong></em></p><p>The biggest upgrades with the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025 over the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic is the more durable and water-resistant design, the larger screen, and the extra battery life.

The phone isn't expected for another year, but it's never too early to speculate on what may be. After all, Samsung has likely already begun work on its next flip phone.</p><p>Based solely on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on">our brief time with the Galaxy Z Flip 7</a>, it's not hard to see where the strengths and weaknesses lie. This helps us speculate the areas where we could see improvements with the Galaxy Z Flip 8, as well as places where Samsung may not change anything at all.</p><p>So, what can we expect from the Galaxy Z Flip 8, and what do we want to see? Let's take a look.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-8-price-and-release-date"><span>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 8: Price and release date</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="EDViSRgQkr6UKcF7r9wHA6" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on-4" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 Different Colors hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EDViSRgQkr6UKcF7r9wHA6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung only just <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/biggest-announcements-from-samsungs-summer-unpacked-galaxy-z-fold-7-flip-7-and-more">launched the Galaxy Z Flip 7 in early July</a>, meaning we probably won't expect the Galaxy Z Flip 8 until next July. While previous summer Unpacked events took place in August, Samsung seems set on July being the new launch month for its foldables. Thus, barring any changes, we can expect a similar time frame for 2026.</p><p>As for pricing, there's no reason to believe Samsung will increase the price on the Galaxy Z Flip 8. We saw a $100 increase with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>, but the Flip 7 retained the same pricing despite the new chip and larger cover screen.</p><p>Meanwhile, if Samsung continues to launch new Galaxy Z Flip FE models, we do hope that it considers lowering the price to something that matches the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-review">Razr 2025</a>, for example.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-8-specs"><span>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 8: Specs</span></h2><div ><table><caption>Specs</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 8 (rumored/expected)</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.9-inch, 2520 x 1080, FHD+, Dynamic AMOLED 2X,  LTPO (1-120Hz)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Cover display</p></td><td  ><p>4.1-inch Super AMOLED, 60/120Hz, 948 x 1048</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Operating System</p></td><td  ><p>Android 17 (One UI 9)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Chipset</p></td><td  ><p>Samsung Exynos 2600</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB, 512GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 1</p></td><td  ><p>50MP</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 2</p></td><td  ><p>12MP</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Front-facing Camera</p></td><td  ><p>10MP</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>4,300mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging</p></td><td  ><p>25W wired charging, 10W wireless charging, 4.5W reverse wireless charging</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>---</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions (folded)</p></td><td  ><p>---</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions (unfolded)</p></td><td  ><p>---</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP48</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>---</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-8-design-and-displays"><span>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 8: Design and displays</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="mS44iNV3AmA3o353vWNB76" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on-28" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mS44iNV3AmA3o353vWNB76.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung is known to utilize smartphone designs over multiple years. Since the company just introduced a fresh design for the Galaxy Z Flip 7, we don't expect anything drastic for 2026. The phone will likely look very similar to this year's Flip, save for some minor cosmetic changes such as new colors and slightly different dimensions.</p><p>In fact, we hope Samsung doesn't make any drastic changes, as the company has seemingly perfected the Galaxy Z Flip 7 design.</p><p>Samsung was able to shave off some millimeters on the Z Flip 7 chassis, making the phone much thinner than its predecessor and its closest competitor. We hope that the Z Flip 8 is able to retain the same thinness, even with any potential changes Samsung makes.</p><p>One small change Samsung implemented from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-vs-galaxy-z-flip-5">Flip 5 to the Flip 6</a> was a color-matched ring around the camera lenses. Samsung could make a similar change next year.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="Giex8BdsLmvHvkMXqsBjA6" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on-12" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Giex8BdsLmvHvkMXqsBjA6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1407" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Meanwhile, the displays are likely to remain the same. That means that Galaxy Z Flip 8 could retain the 6.9-inch primary folding display and external 4.1-inch panel. An improved hinge design has resulted in a minimal crease compared to previous generations, something we expect Samsung to continue to improve.</p><p>Lastly, Samsung may introduce different colors with the Galaxy Z Flip 8. We do hope some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/what-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-color-should-you-buy">Galaxy Z Flip 7 colors</a> remain, such as the Navy Blue and Coralred, but we would like to see other bold and vibrant colors, like the green it introduced with the Galaxy S22 series.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-8-hardware"><span>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 8: Hardware</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="tDfz8STyLsNiQN2JhuyW26" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on-3" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 in Blue Shadow hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tDfz8STyLsNiQN2JhuyW26.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Galaxy Z Flip 7 was a notable departure for Samsung, arriving with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-official-exynos-2500-soc-unpacked-devices-reveal">Exynos 2500</a> instead of the Snapdragon chip powering the rest of the company's flagship phones. Although there was no explanation provided, it's likely due to cost and efficiency considerations, given the nature of flip phones.</p><p>Because of this, we expect Samsung may stick with Exynos for the Galaxy Z Flip 8. In fact, Samsung has reportedly been working on a 2nm Exynos 2600. According to reports, it seems <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://biz.newdaily.co.kr/site/data/html/2025/06/11/2025061100145.html">yields for the new chip are pretty high</a>, and Samsung seems confident enough in its upcoming chip that it will power the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26</a> series. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/new-exynos-2600-benchmarks-predict-an-exciting-clash-with-snapdragon/">Early benchmarks</a> also suggest that the chip could be quite impressive, which is good news for the Galaxy Z Flip 8.</p><p>Aside from an Exynos chip, we expect the phone to feature at least 12GB of RAM to power Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> features. It will also likely come with 256GB and 512GB of storage, as Samsung has yet to launch a model with 1TB of storage.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="A6ELLJLDS33kzrnJ3nxXHo" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on-charging-port" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 Charging Port" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/A6ELLJLDS33kzrnJ3nxXHo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Galaxy Z Flip 7 received a battery increase from 4,000mAh to 4,300mAh, which is impressive given the slimmer profile. Samsung could increase the capacity, which it often does each year for some of its flagships, but it may also have the same battery. We also expect the same 25W wired charging speed, although given the decrease to 10W wireless charging on the Z Flip 7, we're unsure about what the Galaxy Z Flip 8 will end up with in that regard.</p><p>Samsung has been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-asks-users-sacrifice-thin-phonesbuilt-in-qi2-magnets-survey">questioning consumers</a> about whether or not they want Qi2 magnets on their phones, which could suggest the company is looking into implementing this on its future phones. However, it's unclear if this will work on the Galaxy Z Flip 8.

However, we can still wish for what we want to see based on the current (and even past) Galaxy Z Flip, with the hopes that Samsung will listen and deliver. Here are some of the features we hope to see:</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3916px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="CKLZzpWPboeS8xmGaHgZC9" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-review-28.jpg" alt="The Galaxy Z Flip 6 on a wireless charger" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CKLZzpWPboeS8xmGaHgZC9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3916" height="2203" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Faster charging</strong></p><p>The Galaxy Z Flip 7 was already a bit of a downgrade on the charging front, which is unfortunate to see on a $1,099 phone. The 25W charging speed is simply okay, but with phones like the Razr reaching as much as 68W, it's clear Samsung is purposely holding it back.</p><p>With the Galaxy Z Flip 8, we hope Samsung will finally give us flagship charging speeds, at least as much as 45W wired and 15W or more for wireless charging. This way, it will at least match some of the company's midrange phones and keep up with the steadily increasing battery capacity.</p><p>Qi2 support will also be nice, especially if built-in magnets are involved.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="obbkK4e4hbDGaVLsLB8366" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on-20" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 Google Gemini Cover Screen hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/obbkK4e4hbDGaVLsLB8366.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>AI button</strong></p><p>The Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 includes an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/razr-ultra-ai-key-misses-the-mark-google-and-samsung-should-do-it-better">AI Key</a>, which is meant to be a handy way to access <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a> at the press of a button (and freeing the power button).

While both smartwatches have the same goal of trying to help you improve your running, they try to do so at different price points. The Forerunner 970, retailing for $750, brings the Forerunner closer in capabilities to Garmin's highest-end smartwatches. Meanwhile, the Forerunner 570 attacks the midrange market.</p><p>The Garmin Forerunner 570 and Forerunner 970 are both somewhat flawed devices. The Forerunner 570 lacks a few features we've come to take for granted at the $550 price point, like ECG support.

They come with a somewhat loud design, but this is typically appreciated by runners. Each is offered in unique colorways that can emphasize a sporty look, or you can opt for black to try to remain subtle.</p><p>Still, the Forerunner 970's polymer case doesn't look the most premium, and that's to preserve a lightweight build. It does have a titanium bezel and metal buttons for durability, though. There's also a colored Forerunner metal accent piece on the side to emphasize the runner-first ethos of this watch.

That being said, they're both cut from the same cloth, so there are a ton of design similarities here.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="MLC2qP4VW6tpaX7bsmzU7b" name="Garmin-Forerunner-970-race-projection" alt="The Garmin Forerunner 970 showing the projected pace for a half marathon, with a blue line pointing to possible times seven weeks from now." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MLC2qP4VW6tpaX7bsmzU7b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Garmin upgraded the display on the Forerunner 970, doubling its peak brightness. The smartwatch features a 1.4-inch AMOLED touchscreen with a 454x454 resolution. The move to AMOLED adds clarity and color while preserving brightness, and it doesn't appear to come at the cost of battery life.</p><p>By comparison, the Forerunner 570 ships with either a 1.2-inch or 1.4-inch screen, depending on what size you get. It's also an AMOLED panel, but this watch doesn't last as long as the Forerunner 970. Both watches will be plenty bright enough for outdoor workouts.</p><h2 id="garmin-forerunner-970-vs-forerunner-570-hardware-and-specs-2">Garmin Forerunner 970 vs. Forerunner 570: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="NbGJRz4ELSwnKYk52nmJuJ" name="Garmin-Forerunner-970-mapping-route" alt="The Garmin Forerunner 970 showing a course route on a detailed city map." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NbGJRz4ELSwnKYk52nmJuJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are slight differences between the Forerunner 970 and 570 in terms of hardware.  Both watches use the same Garmin Elevate v5 heart rate sensor, which is the latest and most accurate version. However, the 970 takes that one step further, adding ECG support and a skin temperature sensor. The Forerunner 970 and 570 both have a blood-oxygen sensor, accelerometer, altimeter, compass, and gyroscope.</p><p>The pricier 970 comes with quadruple the available storage space, with 32GB onboard. Meanwhile, you only get 8GB on the 570 for music and workout files. Additionally, the 970 has a few more GPS bands, and both support multi-band GPS.</p><div ><table><caption>Specifications</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Garmin Forerunner 970 </p></th><th  ><p>Garmin Forerunner 570</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Size</p></td><td  ><p>47 x 47 x 12.9mm, 22mm QuickFit band</p></td><td  ><p><strong>42mm</strong>: 42.4 x 42.4 x 12.9mm</p><p><strong>47mm</strong>: 47 x 47 x 12.9mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>56 g</p></td><td  ><p><strong>42mm</strong>:<strong> </strong>42g</p><p><strong>47mm</strong>: 50g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Materials</p></td><td  ><p>Titanium bezel, polymer case, silicone strap</p></td><td  ><p>Aluminum bezel, silicone strap</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Protection</p></td><td  ><p>5ATM, sapphire glass</p></td><td  ><p>Corning Gorilla Glass 3, 5 ATM</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>1.4" (454x454) AMOLED touchscreen</p></td><td  ><p><strong>42mm</strong>: 1.2" (390 x 390)</p><p><strong>47mm</strong>: 1.4" (454 x 454)</p><p>AMOLED</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery life</p></td><td  ><p>15 days, 23 hours (SatIQ GPS), 14 hours (multi-band GPS w/ music)</p></td><td  ><p><strong>42mm</strong>: 10 days (smartwatch mode), 18 hours (GPS-only GNSS mode)</p><p><strong>47mm</strong>: 11 days (smartwatch mode), 18 hours (GPS-Only GNSS mode)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>32GB</p></td><td  ><p>8GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Sensors</p></td><td  ><p>Elevate v5 HRM, SpO2, accelerometer, altimeter, compass, gyroscope, ECG, skin temperature</p></td><td  ><p>Elevate v5 HR, SpO2, accelerometer, altimeter, compass, gyroscope</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Tracking</p></td><td  ><p>GPS, GLONASS, GALILEO, BeiDou, QZSS, SatIQ, multi-band GPS</p></td><td  ><p>GPS, GLONASS, GALILEO, SatIQ, multi-band GPS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Bluetooth, ANT+, NFC</p></td><td  ><p>Bluetooth, ANT+, NFC</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Flashlight</p></td><td  ><p>✔️</p></td><td  ><p>❌</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Mic & speaker</p></td><td  ><p>✔️</p></td><td  ><p>✔️</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>In terms of battery life, the Forerunner 970 will get you further.

They just aren't entirely equal. There are a few features exclusive to the Forerunner 970, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-forerunner-970-running-tolerance-tool-too-useful-to-be-premium-feature">Running Tolerance</a>. This will calculate a biomechanical "impact load" for each mile you run, adjusting for things like elevation and high-intensity interval training (HIIT). It's aimed to help you avoid overexertion and overuse injuries.</p><p>There are other perks, like <strong>running economy</strong> and <strong>step speed</strong>, available if you happen to have an HRM-600 chest strap to add data points.

It does lack electrocardiogram (ECG) support, which has become commonplace on smartwatches and offline maps. Still, I'd bet that most runners don't use either of those features very often — I know I don't. It's an excellent, slim, and sporty watch for running that's versatile and available in multiple sizes.</p><p>On the other hand, the Forerunner 970 is for the runner who's envious of multisport watches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Fenix 8</a> and wants that experience on a Forerunner model. At $750, the 970 is expensive, but it's actually much cheaper than those top-tier models like the Fenix 8 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-ditched-my-apple-and-galaxy-watches-for-a-garmin-and-you-should-too">Enduro 3</a>.

Pre-orders for the device are rumored to start that same day, with full availability beginning Aug. 28.</p><p>The Google Pixel 10 Pro XL is tipped to start with 256GB of storage, with upgrades to 512GB or 1TB available. Since the phone might not be available in the smaller 128GB base capacity, it will reportedly start at $1,199, an increase of $100 compared to the Pixel 9 Pro XL. It's rumored to be sold in Sterling Gray, Light Porcelain, Midnight, and Smoky Green colorways.</p><p>Even with a rumored price hike, the Pixel 10 Pro XL will cost less than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> at full price. The phone was announced on Jan. 22, 2025, and was officially released Feb. 7. Samsung sells the Galaxy S25 Ultra for $1,299, and it starts with 256GB of storage, with upgrades up to 1TB available.

By this point, we've not only seen alleged renderings for the device but also real-life shots. If these turn out to be true, we're looking at a design language that's quite similar to the Pixel 9 Pro XL. There's a pill-shaped camera bar, a matte back, polished side rails, and rounded corners.</p><p>It's possible that the dimensions are tweaked slightly, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/thinborne-designed-pixel-10-cases-sold-out">early case samples support that prediction</a>. However, we still expect the Pixel 10 Pro XL to keep a similar form factor to the Pixel 9 Pro XL, which measured 162.8 x 76.6 x 8.5 mm and weighed 221 grams. After all, both phones have a 6.9-inch screen and the same hardware, according to rumors.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JUWqYvwqm6NB7ycFJnFzV9" name="Pixel-10-pro-prototype" alt="Pixel 10 Pro leaks in all angles" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JUWqYvwqm6NB7ycFJnFzV9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Mystic Leaks)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It'll likely be a 6.8-inch LTPO AMOLED panel capable of 120Hz refresh rates and at least 3000 nits of peak brightness. The resolution is said to be 2992 x 1344 pixels, which is the same as last year. Covering the display will be Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2, and it'll also serve as the rear glass.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra has a similar footprint, with dimensions measuring 162.8 x 77.6 x 8.2mm. In fact, it'll likely be both thinner and lighter than the Pixel 10 Pro XL. That's despite the Galaxy S25 Ultra offering a bigger, 6.9-inch screen and space for an internally stored S Pen stylus.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="S9XYxfiXSVoD97gT4q6rYZ" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review-16x9" alt="Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra Home Screen - 16x9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/S9XYxfiXSVoD97gT4q6rYZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The display is a 6.9-inch QHD+ AMOLED with support for 120Hz adaptive refresh rates and a resolution of 3120 x 1440 pixels.

Samsung opted for a titanium construction on the Galaxy S25 Ultra, which helps with strength and weight.</p><p>Both the Pixel 10 Pro XL and the Galaxy S25 Ultra are expected to sport an IP68 rating against dust and water ingress.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hardware-and-specs-2">Google Pixel 10 Pro XL vs. Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="Um3rLTAzHFeM7e73XBQocb" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-renders-01" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Um3rLTAzHFeM7e73XBQocb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines/ via OnLeaks)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google is set to upgrade the internals of the Pixel 10 Pro XL, per reports, to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/is-googles-switch-from-samsung-foundry-to-tsmc-for-the-tensor-g5-chip-a-big-deal">Tensor G5 chipset</a>, which is no surprise. The bigger deal is that the Tensor G5 chip is said to be fabricated by TSMC, rather than Samsung Foundry, and will use the advanced 3nm process. As part of the switch, Google is said to be moving to more custom internal components, perhaps improving Pixel's optimizations and efficiency gains.</p><p>With a Google-designed chip, more custom components, and TSMC fabrication, the Tensor G5 could help the Pixel 10 Pro XL become the most efficient and smooth Android phone yet. The phone is expected to launch with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-review">Android 16</a> out of the box.</p><p>Samsung's Galaxy S25 Ultra will still be the performance champion, despite all of Google's expected improvements. It is equipped with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy mobile platform</a>, which is the fastest available for Android phones. It's particularly excellent for AI tasks, and it will be interesting to see how the Tensor G5 compares.</p><p>Notably, the Galaxy S25 Ultra ships with 12GB of RAM, whereas the Pixel 10 Pro XL could launch with 16GB by default.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel 10 Pro XL (rumored/assumed)</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.8-inch LTPO OLED, 120Hz, HDR10+, 3000 nits (peak)</p></td><td  ><p>6.9-inch QHD+ AMOLED, 120Hz Adaptive Refresh Rate</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Google Tensor G5</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Memory</p></td><td  ><p>16GB</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB, 512GB, 1TB</p></td><td  ><p>256GB, 512GB, 1TB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Front Camera</p></td><td  ><p>42 MP, f/2.2</p></td><td  ><p>12MP (wide)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 1</p></td><td  ><p>50 MP, f/1.7 wide</p></td><td  ><p>200MP Wide, AF, OIS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 2</p></td><td  ><p>48 MP, f/1.7 ultrawide</p></td><td  ><p>50MP Ultrawide, AF, OIS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 3</p></td><td  ><p>48 MP, f/2.8 5x periscope telephoto</p></td><td  ><p>10MP 3x Telephoto, AF, OIS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 4</p></td><td  ><p>N/A</p></td><td  ><p>50MP 5x Telephoto, AF, OIS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Camera Features</p></td><td  ><p>Best Take, Add Me, Magic Editor</p></td><td  ><p>HDR Portraits, Selfie AI ISP, Nightography, High-res Macro, High-res Zoom, Log Video</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>5,200mAh</p></td><td  ><p>5,000mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging</p></td><td  ><p>39W wired, 23W wireless</p></td><td  ><p>45W wired, 15W wireless, 4.5W reverse-wireless</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>5G, Wi-Fi 7, UWB</p></td><td  ><p>5G (sub-6GHz, mmWave), Wi-Fi 7, UWB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Biometrics</p></td><td  ><p>Ultrasonic Fingerprint Scanner, Face Recognition</p></td><td  ><p>Ultrasonic Fingerprint Scanner, Face Recognition</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ingress Protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP68, Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 (front and rear glass)</p></td><td  ><p>IP68, Corning Gorilla Armor (front glass), Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 (rear glass), Titanium</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>162.8 x 76.6 x 8.5 mm</p></td><td  ><p>162.8 x 77.6 x 8.2mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>221 grams</p></td><td  ><p>218 grams</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Software</p></td><td  ><p>Android 16</p></td><td  ><p>One UI 7 w/ Android 15 (upgradeable)</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>In the camera department, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra will likely win, at least on paper. It has four rear camera sensors, and the system is highlighted by a 200MP wide camera. On top of that, you get a 50MP ultrawide, a 10MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom, and a 50MP telephoto with 5x optical zoom. Put simply, this may be the most versatile system available in the U.S. market, fit for any situation.</p><p>Google's Pixel 10 Pro XL is rumored to keep things exactly the same as its predecessor. That would mean three rear cameras, starting with a 50MP, f/1.7 main camera. The secondary cameras would be a 48MP ultrawide and a 48MP periscope telephoto lens, with the latter being capable of 5x optical zoom.</p><p>There's more than meets the eye here, as hardware is only part of the story. If you prefer Samsung or Google's computational photography and color science profiles, that may be reason enough to choose one phone over another.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-to-wait-or-to-buy-2">Google Pixel 10 Pro XL vs. Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra: To wait or to buy?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="SK2PCADSS5tRefwmc4Wxtj" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-with-s-pen-angled-view" alt="Angled view of all four Galaxy S25 Ultra colors with S Pens unsheathed" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SK2PCADSS5tRefwmc4Wxtj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Google Pixel 10 Pro XL and the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra are sure to be competitors immediately after the former's release. With the Galaxy S25 Ultra getting older, it'll likely see discounts that will help it match or beat the $1,199 price point of the Pixel 10 Pro XL. Samsung's use of the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset will ensure the Galaxy S25 Ultra has an edge, even over the Tensor G5 processor in the newest Pixel.</p><p>There will be clear reasons to pick the Galaxy S25 Ultra over the Pixel 10 Pro XL. Aside from performance, the Galaxy has a larger display and S Pen support. It also brings along five total cameras and a combination of Google AI and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI features</a>. All of these could be deciding factors for people in the market for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">great Android phone</a>.</p><p>Still, the Pixel 10 Pro XL will have plenty of reasons to exist. It's slightly more compact, runs Pixel UI over One UI, and has Google's efficiency and optimization. It'll just be hard for Google's highest-end flagship to beat the Galaxy S25 Ultra on paper.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="3bb2d9ca-466d-4901-899b-e1c624b1fb74">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TZEu2Ducm7W2oGBJ8EuUfC.jpg' alt="The leaked render of the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 10 Pro XL</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>A promising upgrade</strong></em></p><p>The Google Pixel 10 Pro XL should be an enticing Android phone due to the Tensor G5 platform shift and other improvements.

It's the long-awaited successor to the Phone 2, a phone that debuted in 2023 at a more affordable price point. Now, the question is simple: did Nothing do enough to make the Phone 3 a great value at $800?</p><p>On paper, it seems like the answer is a firm "no." The Nothing Phone 3 lacks a flagship processor and key specs, like LTPO support. Still, the Phone 3 is the evolution of the Phone 2, so should Nothing fans upgrade? Let's see how the new Nothing Phone 3 stacks up against the Phone 2 and find out.</p><h2 id="nothing-phone-3-vs-phone-2-pricing-and-availability-2">Nothing Phone 3 vs. Phone 2: Pricing and availability</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="BLXeGu6zh4ov8NHNnNuAUR" name="Nothing Phone 3" alt="Nothing Phone 3 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BLXeGu6zh4ov8NHNnNuAUR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-phone-3-review">Nothing Phone 3</a> became widely available worldwide on July 15, 2025. The phone costs $799 for the 12GB/256GB version, and $899 for the 16GB/512GB model. It's also available in Europe, the U.K., and India. You can get it in white or black colorways, and both get the customizable and interactive dot matrix display.</p><p>Meanwhile, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Nothing Phone 2</a> launched in 2023 and started at $599 USD / $929 CAD for the 8GB/128GB configuration. The smartphone could be equipped with up to 12GB of RAM and 512GB of storage for a higher cost. Now, two years later, it's hard to find new Phone 2 models at reasonable prices. It's no longer sold through the Nothing store, so you'll have to look at third parties and used markets.</p><h2 id="nothing-phone-3-vs-phone-2-design-and-display-2">Nothing Phone 3 vs. Phone 2: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="7eAWSHMd6AKPC4yM25ocSR" name="Nothing Phone 3" alt="Nothing Phone 3 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7eAWSHMd6AKPC4yM25ocSR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Nothing phones have never conformed to conventional design standards, but the Phone 3 diverts from the brand's own storied designs. Every Nothing phone to date, up until the Phone 3, has had a Glyph interface — a system of light strips that can be used for everything from notification and call alerts to serving as a makeshift flashlight.</p><p>The Nothing Phone 2 features the Glyph interface, but the Nothing Phone 3 leaves that design staple behind in favor of a dot matrix grid. It's a tiny display that's more versatile than the Glyph interface, showing things like battery life and fun elements like Glyph Toys.</p><p>Officially, Nothing calls this the Glyph Matrix. If you've seen the rear display on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-9-pro-review">Asus ROG Phone 9 Pro</a>, you already have an idea of what to expect from the Phone 3's Glyph Matrix.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ZW9nisNrTB4mXhX24fMLgL" name="Nothing-phone-2-back-glyphs-on-05.jpg" alt="The Glyph lights illuminated on the back of a Nothing Phone (2)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZW9nisNrTB4mXhX24fMLgL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Otherwise, the Phone 3 and Phone 2 are quite similar in terms of form factor. The newer model is actually a bit smaller, sporting a 6.67-inch screen instead of the 6.7-inch panel found on its predecessor. Both use OLED displays with 1,600 nits of peak brightness and can hit 120Hz refresh rates. Unfortunately, neither phone is using advanced display technology like LTPO variable refresh rates or high brightness modes.</p><p>As such, the Nothing Phone 3 is more compact overall but is thicker, measuring 160.6 x 75.6 x 9mm. Meanwhile, the Phone 2 is thinner and lighter, measuring 162.1mm x 76.4mm x 8.6mm and weighing in at 201.2 grams. At 218 grams, the Nothing Phone 3 will feel noticeably heavier than the Phone 2.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="5fhKVjsRUXErAvpzZ8EJLR" name="Nothing Phone 3" alt="Nothing Phone 3 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5fhKVjsRUXErAvpzZ8EJLR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Nothing also made sure the Phone 3 stood out in a crowd with its unique rear camera arrangement. There are three lenses on the back, but they're all positioned individually across the top-left corner of the device. By comparison, the Phone 2 has two rear lenses neatly organized vertically, closely resembling an iPhone camera layout.</p><p>The Nothing Phone 3 received a much-needed durability upgrade, as it now supports IP68 dust and water resistance. With only an IP54 certification, the dust and water-resistance capabilities of the older Phone 2 lagged behind the competition.</p><h2 id="nothing-phone-3-vs-phone-2-hardware-and-specs-2">Nothing Phone 3 vs. Phone 2: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5163px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="yv9zGEWQ8zj4AB8nhsXbPR" name="Nothing Phone 3" alt="Nothing Phone 3 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yv9zGEWQ8zj4AB8nhsXbPR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5163" height="2908" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Nothing's positioning of the Phone 3 as a true flagship starts to fall apart when moving to the device's internals.

Without it, the Nothing Phone 3's peak performance is limited.</p><p>With that being said, this chipset will make the Phone 3 feel much faster than the Phone 2 it replaces. The Nothing Phone 2 is equipped with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1 mobile platform, and it's an older processor that isn't positioned well for the AI era. Additionally, you could make the argument that like the Nothing Phone 3, Google Pixel phones and their Tensor processors will lose to Snapdragon 8 Elite-powered flagships in raw performance.</p><p>Still, when you can get phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> for only a few bucks more, it makes paying $800 for the Nothing Phone 3 a tough sell.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Nothing Phone 3</p></th><th  ><p>Nothing Phone 2</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.67-inch 120Hz OLED, Gorilla Glass 7i, 1,600 nits max</p></td><td  ><p>6.7-inch 120Hz OLED (LTPO), 2142 x 1080 (394 PPI), 1,600 nits peak brightness, Gorilla Glass</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>Nothing OS 3.5 based on Android 15</p></td><td  ><p>Nothing OS 2 based on Android 13 (upgradeable)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Chipset</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8s Gen 4, Adreno 825, 4nm node</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>12GB/16GB</p></td><td  ><p>8GB or 12GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB/512GB UFS 4.0</p></td><td  ><p>128GB, 256GB, 512GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear camera 1</p></td><td  ><p>50MP f/1.7 OmniVision OV50H, OIS</p></td><td  ><p>50MP, Sony IMX890, ƒ/1.88, 1.0μm, 1/1.56-inch sensor size, OIS and EIS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear camera 2</p></td><td  ><p>50MP  f/2.7 ISOCELL JN5, 3x optical zoom, OIS</p></td><td  ><p>50MP, Samsung JN1 sensor, ƒ/2.2, 0.64μm, 1/2.76-inch sensor size, 114-degree FoV, EIS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear camera 3</p></td><td  ><p>50MP f/2.2 ISOCELL JN1 wide-angle</p></td><td  ><p>N/A</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Front camera</p></td><td  ><p>50MP ISOCELL JN1, 4K60 video</p></td><td  ><p>32MP, ƒ/2.45, 1/2.7-inch sensor size</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ingress protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP68 dust and water resistance</p></td><td  ><p>IP54 dust and water resistance</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6.0, NFC, Dual-band GPS, AptX HD</p></td><td  ><p>Bluetooth 5.3, NFC, Wi-Fi 6, 5G Sub-6</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Security</p></td><td  ><p>Optical fingerprint sensor</p></td><td  ><p>In-display fingerprint sensor</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Audio</p></td><td  ><p>USB-C, stereo sound</p></td><td  ><p>Stereo speakers, 3 microphones with noise suppression</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>5,150mAh silicon-carbon battery (5,500mAh in India), 65W USB PD charging, 15W wireless charging</p></td><td  ><p>4,700mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>160.6 x 75.6 x 9mm; 218g</p></td><td  ><p>162.1mm x 76.4mm x 8.6mm; 201.2g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>White, Black</p></td><td  ><p>White, Dark Gray</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Compared to Phone 2, the Nothing Phone 3 has the key advantage of having more base RAM and storage.

Or, whether you have a Google Pixel phone that can tightly integrate with the Pixel Watch 3.</p><p>If you're choosing between the Garmin Vivoactive 6 and the Google Pixel Watch 3, let's break down how these smartwatches compare.</p><h2 id="garmin-vivoactive-6-vs-google-pixel-watch-3-design-and-display-2">Garmin Vivoactive 6 vs. Google Pixel Watch 3: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3JU9S5KGiex4sWQQFp7nXC" name="Garmin-Vivoactive-6-review-13" alt="A workout on the Garmin Vivoactive 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3JU9S5KGiex4sWQQFp7nXC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-vivoactive-6-review">Garmin Vivoactive 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Google Pixel Watch 3</a> have relatively muted and simplistic designs, at least compared to other smartwatches. Google offers the Pixel Watch 3 in two different case sizes: 41mm and 45mm, allowing you to choose the one that best matches your wrist size. This does come at an extra cost — the 41mm watch starts at $349, and the 45mm watch starts at $399.</p><p>Still, it may serve you better than the Vivoactive 6, which tries to find a middle ground as a one-size-fits-all watch with a 42mm case size. It's cheaper, retailing for $299, and also thinner. At 10.9 mm thick, the Vivoactive 6 will have a slimmer profile on the wrist than the 12.3mm Pixel Watch 3.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="cm3nSuJTMJFTvtgbnXPkoC" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-3-weather-tile" alt="The Google Pixel Watch 3 showing the Weather tile, with an hourly forecast for the evening." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cm3nSuJTMJFTvtgbnXPkoC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Garmin's Vivoactive 6 is made using a fiber-reinforced polymer case with an anodized aluminum bezel and a silicone strap.

The Vivoactive 6 sports a 1.2-inch AMOLED screen with a 390x390 resolution, and if you're used to bigger smartwatch displays, this might feel a bit cramped. Surprisingly, Google crammed a bigger display into a smaller case size, as the 41mm Pixel Watch 3 comes with a 1.27-inch AMOLED panel with a 408x408 resolution.</p><p>Of course, you can always step up to the 45mm Pixel Watch 3 if you need a bigger screen. The larger variant has a 1.43-inch AMOLED display with a 456x456 resolution.</p><h2 id="garmin-vivoactive-6-vs-google-pixel-watch-3-hardware-and-specs-2">Garmin Vivoactive 6 vs. Google Pixel Watch 3: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4109px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="2nX3bKtM98uLsNbfyJyjBC" name="Garmin-Vivoactive-6-review-12" alt="A workout animation on the Garmin Vivoactive 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2nX3bKtM98uLsNbfyJyjBC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4109" height="2311" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While the Garmin Vivoactive 6 provides a robust health and fitness experience of the features it <em>does</em> support, there are some gaps. For instance, the watch includes the last-gen Garmin Elevate v4 heart-rate monitor, an accelerometer, a pulse-oxygen sensor, a compass, and a gyroscope. This, paired with Garmin software, helps paint a pretty full picture of your health and fitness data at the $299 price point.</p><p>Still, there are things missing, like a barometric altimeter — this means you can't track elevation during runs or hikes. Other key hardware omissions include a microphone and speaker, so you won't be answering calls on your watch with the Vivoactive 6.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Google Pixel Watch 3 has a more well-rounded sensor suite, adding an altimeter, barometer, electrical skin conductance for body response (cEDA) sensor, and a skin temperature sensor. It also supports ECG readings, if you care about those. The tricky part about this comparison is that the Pixel Watch doesn't always make the most of this data because its software features are limited.</p><div ><table><caption>Specifications</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Garmin Vivoactive 6</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel Watch 3</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Materials</p></td><td  ><p>Fiber-reinforced polymer (Case); Anodized aluminum (Bezel)</p></td><td  ><p>Recycled aluminum</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>1.2-inch AMOLED touchscreen, 390 x 309</p></td><td  ><p>1.27-inch (408x408) or 1.43-inch (456x456) Actua AMOLED LTPO display</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Protection</p></td><td  ><p>Gorilla Glass 3; 5ATM</p></td><td  ><p>Corning Gorilla Glass 5, 5ATM, IP68</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Band</p></td><td  ><p>20mm quick-release band</p></td><td  ><p>Active (fluoroelastomer)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Tracking</p></td><td  ><p>GPS, GLONASS, GALILEO, QZSS, BeiDou; All-Systems mode (No dual band)</p></td><td  ><p>GPS, Galileo, Glonass, (ROW) Beidou, QZSS, Navic</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Sensors</p></td><td  ><p>Elevate v4 HRM; Pulse Ox (SpO2); accelerometer; ambient light sensor; compass; gyroscope</p></td><td  ><p>Multi-path optical HR sensor, red & IR sensors for SpO2, multipurpose electrical (ECG), electrical skin conductance for body response (cEDA), skin temperature, accelerometer, altimeter, ambient light, barometer, compass, gyroscope, magnetometer</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Garmin Pay (NFC), Bluetooth, ANT+, Wi-Fi</p></td><td  ><p>Bluetooth 5.3, Wi-Fi 2.4/5GHz, NFC, UWB, LTE (upgrade)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Mic and speaker</p></td><td  ><p>No</p></td><td  ><p>Yes</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>Smartwatch mode: 11 days</p></td><td  ><p>306mAh/ 420mAh, 24 hours with AOD, 36 hours with Battery Saver</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Music storage</p></td><td  ><p>8GB; Spotify, Deezer, Amazon Music, or own music files</p></td><td  ><p>32GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>42.2 x 42.2 x 10.9 mm</p></td><td  ><p>41 x 41 x 12.3mm / 45 x 45 x 12.3mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight / with strap</p></td><td  ><p>23g / 36g</p></td><td  ><p>41mm: 55g/63g; 45mm: 61g/69g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Price</p></td><td  ><p>$299.99</p></td><td  ><p>$349.99 (41mm), $399.99 (45mm)</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Additionally, the Google Pixel Watch 3 does support LTE connectivity, but you have to pay extra for that model.

Both excel in their own key areas. Despite having fewer sensors, the Vivoactive 6 has a better health and fitness software suite.</p><p>It can track more than 80 different kinds of workouts, which is great if you train outside the box. Garmin's software will also suggest daily walks for you to keep you active and moving. There are workout videos viewable right on the watch and specialized features like workout tracking. This will detect your weightlifting reps and rests automatically during and between sets.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Pixel Watch 3 uses Fitbit primarily for health and fitness software. It's not as great an experience as Garmin's robust suite, but it may do the job if you only track casual workouts. Crucially, the Pixel Watch 3 runs on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a>, which means you have a large suite of third-party apps and smartphone integration available.

GPS tracking is more consistent, and there are extra non-running features for those who prefer the gym to the track. If that sounds like you, the Vivoactive 6 will probably serve you better than the Pixel Watch 3.</p><p>However, the Pixel Watch 3 has a similar advantage — it runs Wear OS. If you need tight integration with your Android phone, like the Fitbit UI, or rely on third-party smartwatch apps, the Pixel Watch 3 is your pick. It all depends on your individual needs. For health features, go with Garmin. For smart features, choose Pixel.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="75b5b5c4-3808-4a3c-b02b-217891e7919c">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/secwvVBDhnoMFv8tL5mbJ6.jpg' alt="The Garmin Vivoactive 6 against a white background."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Garmin Vivoactive 6</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>All about fitness</strong></em></p><p>While the Vivoactive 6's health and fitness suite is relatively tame by Garmin standards, it's robust compared to Wear OS watches.

While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nothing-ear-1-review">Ear 1</a> had issues with tonality, Nothing resolved these with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/nothing-ear-2-review">Ear 2</a>, and subsequent products have been nothing short of incredible. So when the brand said it was venturing into headphones, I was obviously excited. I prefer over-ear headsets to earbuds, and the Headphone 1 is positioned as an alternative to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-earbuds-review">Bose QuietComfort Ultra</a> and Sony WH-1000XM6.</p><p>Obviously, design is a key tenet of all Nothing products, and the Headphone 1 looks like nothing else available today. As much as I like the design of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-phone-3-review">Phone 3</a>, I think the Headphone 1 is Nothing's best-looking product yet. The unique rectangular design with a stylized outer shell that evokes memories of cassettes is just plain cool, and the novelty doesn't really wear off even after using the Headphone 1 for a while.</p><p>The white model in particular looks gorgeous, and the distinctive design is backed by good build quality. The shell is made out of aluminum, and it's joined by a plastic headband. At 329g, it is on the lighter end of the scale, and I like the comfort quite a bit — I didn't have any issues wearing the Headphone 1 for hours on end.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LtXA9S5zweEBqfxPJZbSVZ" name="Nothing Headphone 1" alt="Nothing Headphone 1 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LtXA9S5zweEBqfxPJZbSVZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The retro-futuristic design combined with a comfortable fit makes the Headphone 1 a better choice than the Sony WH-1000XM6, and I like the attention to detail.

The bundled case is pretty good as well, and it doesn't take up too much room. The Headphone 1 gets a 1,040mAh battery, and it lasted just under 30 hours in my testing. That's more than enough, and you get a fast charging mode that delivers two hours music playback with just a five-minute charge; a full charge takes over two hours.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LHT6sEjrt8d4pNjhVvVdWZ" name="Nothing Headphone 1" alt="Nothing Headphone 1 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LHT6sEjrt8d4pNjhVvVdWZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Nothing did a good job dialing in the noise isolation as well, and I didn't have any problems in this area. My QuietComfort Ultra still has the edge, but the Headphone 1 does a good enough job tuning out ambient sounds. You can easily customize settings via Nothing X, and there's also an 8-band EQ that allows for granular customization of the sound.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="2moWzQ9nbUGymTHjAmkjVZ" name="Nothing Headphone 1" alt="Nothing Headphone 1 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2moWzQ9nbUGymTHjAmkjVZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Coming to the sound, the Headphone 1 is made in collaboration with British audio powerhouse KEF.

The Headphone 1 has a custom 40mm driver with sound tuned by KEF, and it sounds amazing.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="YfDzv7ozBPiYUjKcTt92VZ" name="Nothing Headphone 1" alt="Nothing Headphone 1 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YfDzv7ozBPiYUjKcTt92VZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's good low-end energy and vibrancy, and bass-focused tracks have a delightful rumble.

KEF's unique sound signature is evident in the tuning of these headphones, and if you want a neutral sound, you can easily tweak the EQ to your liking.</p><p>Overall, I enjoyed using the Headphone 1 much more than I thought; if anything, I like the headphones more than the Phone 3. The design is sure to turn heads, it's comfortable to wear, sounds great, and is a better deal than its equivalent Sony and Bose rivals.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="5ac4b34e-edac-4c9d-97be-1dd875f0706e">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:145.07%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VWqC28UuSUoU6CKNKeXqn5.jpg' alt="Nothing Headphone 1"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Nothing Headphone 1</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The Headphone 1 is a standout product; it looks distinctive, has a fantastic sound, and doesn't cost as much as its rivals. </p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

It is an AI-powered app that effectively stores all your vital information. The company is now introducing additional features, making it even smarter.</p><p>Late last week, Nothing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nothing.community/d/37461-essential-space-updates">rolled out an update</a> that incorporates Google Calendar. It allows users to sync their to-dos lists directly into Google Calendar.

Users who prefer to record meetings, interviews, or conversations will now be able to fix AI summaries with the edit feature. Further, these recorded moments are now shareable as well. They can be shared in notable formats like via an image, PDF, or Markdown, One tap, or fully packaged.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1067px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="ABpMzfgF4sc94mTmZ2BnVM" name="Essential-Space-editable-memory" alt="Essential Space editable memory" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ABpMzfgF4sc94mTmZ2BnVM.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1067" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nothing)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1067px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="Ux5ziiyNHFVGidG6DGJkVM" name="Essential-space-flip-to-record" alt="Essential Space Flip to record" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ux5ziiyNHFVGidG6DGJkVM.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1067" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nothing)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1067px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="zPxcZEM7jzg8pm6Cp82bVM" name="Essential-space-flip-to-record-share" alt="Essential Space flip to record sharing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zPxcZEM7jzg8pm6Cp82bVM.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1067" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nothing)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><h2 id="who-gets-it-first-2">Who gets it first?</h2><p>As mentioned, the Essential Space feature is available for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/heres-what-i-want-from-nothing-phone-3-after-using-phone-3a-pro">Nothing Phone 3a, 3a Pro</a>, and even the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-phone-3-review">Nothing Phone 3</a>.

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-2">Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025</a> has a new color option, and comes with 64GB of internal storage; other than that, it is identical to the Galaxy Watch Ultra 2024.</p><p>With Samsung choosing to not make any changes this year, any potential upgrades are only likely to show up on the Galaxy Watch Ultra 2026.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-2026-design"><span>Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 2026: Design</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="5NdQkVLAHgipErUWueKZi" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-Funny-Faces-watch-face" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra sitting on a white counter, showing the Funny Faces watch face." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5NdQkVLAHgipErUWueKZi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung has a distinctive design with the Galaxy Watch Ultra that makes it stand out quite a bit from the regular Galaxy Watch, and that's set to continue in 2026. I don't see the brand making any considerable tweaks to the design next year, but I would like to see the rotating bezel make its way onto the device.</p><p>The bezel makes interacting with a smartwatch that much more convenient, and it's a clear point of differentiation with Samsung. Another limiting factor is that the Galaxy Watch Ultra doesn't use standard lugs, and that needs to change; as it stands, there's a limited selection of bands you can use with the smartwatch.</p><p>The 47mm sizing makes the Galaxy Watch Ultra the ideal size, and I don't want that to change in 2026. Samsung does a good job with the chassis itself with the titanium casing clearly built to last, and it's a given that the brand will continue using the same material next year.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-2026-features"><span>Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 2026: Features</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="iZuuQFvr93XmEpcerxjbvL" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-sos-emergency-shortcut.jpeg" alt=""Press the Home button 5 times to call an emergency number" reads the text on the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iZuuQFvr93XmEpcerxjbvL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Galaxy Watch Ultra features the Exynos W1000 platform that's built on a 3nm node, and it delivers significant gains from previous years. I want slightly better efficiency with the Galaxy Watch Ultra 2026 that allows the smartwatch to last at least three days between charges.</p><p>Outside of that, the only other feature I want to see is tighter AI integration. Samsung will ideally need to use a new platform based on the foundation of the W1000 but with a powerful NPU to deliver this, and it's likely we'll see just that in 2026.</p><p>On the feature side of things, Samsung really needs to make ECG available to other devices — having this limited to Samsung phones is a huge drawback. I routinely switch between phones, and not having all features available with a smartwatch is a deal-breaker.</p><p>Similarly, I'd like to see better activity tracking with the Galaxy Watch Ultra 2026; there are enough built-in workout modes, but the current iteration of the smartwatch just doesn't do as good a job as its Garmin rivals when it comes to accuracy.</p><p>Considering the lack of any meaningful upgrades with the Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025, I'd suggest getting the 2024 model if you're interested in switching to a new smartwatch. It has the same feature-set, and it continues to be one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best smartwatches</a> around — and there are great deals to be had right now. If you're willing to wait, the Galaxy Watch Ultra 2026 should deliver decent gains next year.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="0f600266-e8d2-486d-a420-234922bf4b3b">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NqnudFCbUPtb4UpBK5ztT6.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                    <span class='featured__label horizontal__label'> </span>                                                            <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 2024</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The Galaxy Watch Ultra 2024 continues to be just as good as the 2025 model, and it's a much better value now that it's on sale. </p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Samsung delivered plenty of upgrades with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>; the foldable has a thinner and lighter design than its predecessor, and it holds its own against its Chinese rivals in this regard. That's no small feat considering brands like Vivo and Honor have pushed the boundaries in this area in recent years.</p><p>That said, Samsung continues to lag behind when it comes to the battery and cameras, and it misses out on other extras that are standard on the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x-fold-5-review">Vivo X Fold 5</a>. I'm just getting started with my Z Fold 7, and this is what I want to see in next year's Galaxy Z Fold 8.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-8-design"><span>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 8: Design</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="EvV6Hw4NQswxXZ9hq6Mgr3" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on-28" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EvV6Hw4NQswxXZ9hq6Mgr3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Coming in at just 4.2mm when unfolded, the Z Fold 7 is one of the thinnest foldables around. That makes a clear difference when using the device next to the Galaxy Z Fold 6, and Samsung did the right thing by increasing the cover panel to 6.5 inches. This was a major point of contention in the past, and it's thankfully not an issue on the Z Fold 7.</p><p>It's unlikely Samsung will alter the design next year — it has shown that it wants to retain a similar aesthetic year after year — but what I want to see is a slight tweak that makes the device easier to hold. The flat sides are a smidgen uncomfortable, and the addition of bevels like on the Magic V5 and Vivo X Fold 5 should make the Z Fold 8 that much easier to hold and use.</p><p>While Samsung pioneered water resistance on foldables, the Z Fold 8 is limited to IP48 ingress protection, with the Magic V5 and X Fold 5 featuring IP58 and IP59 dust and water resistance as standard. With Google set to deliver IP68 on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, Samsung needs to deliver better durability next year if it wants to maintain its position in this area.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-8-battery"><span>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 8: Battery</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="UERVtfPwoYACWPo9TKawo3" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on-6" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 in Blue Shadow hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UERVtfPwoYACWPo9TKawo3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As much as I like that the Z Fold 7 is considerably thinner, the foldable has the smallest battery of any device I used in 2025. The 4,400mAh battery is just pitiful when even smaller phones like the Vivo X200 FE have a 5,300mAh cell, and I don't really know what Samsung was thinking by putting such a small battery in its latest foldable.</p><p>Clearly, that needs to change in 2026. The Z Fold 8 needs to have at least a 5,000mAh battery, considering this year's Magic V5 has a 5,850mAh battery and the X Fold 5 comes with an even bigger 6,000mAh battery. Switching from the X Fold 5 to the Z Fold 7, there's a clear difference in battery longevity, and this is something Samsung has to rectify with the Z Fold 8.</p><p>On that note, 25W charging just isn't enough any longer on a device that's pushing $2,000. All other foldables I used this year at least have 66W charging, and Samsung is lagging behind by quite a big amount in this area. The biggest advantage of a foldable is the increased real estate made possible by the inner panel, but that's meaningless if the device doesn't even manage to last all day.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-8-cameras"><span>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 8: Cameras</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="eFWyqZviHc8mLXoxuTLZw3" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on-29" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 colors hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eFWyqZviHc8mLXoxuTLZw3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung did the right thing by upgrading the main camera on the Galaxy Z Fold 7 to a 200MP unit. This allows the foldable to hold its own against Honor and Vivo, and while it is undoubtedly a positive move, Samsung didn't lavish the same level of attention on the auxiliary cameras.</p><p>The 12MP wide-angle lens is decent enough, but the 10MP tele lens leaves much to be desired, and it just isn't as good as what you get on the X Fold 5 and Magic V5. Samsung clearly needs to address this shortcoming with the Galaxy Z Fold 8, because it's not just the main camera that differentiates a foldable, but the overall package.</p><p>With the Galaxy Z Fold 7 just now starting to become available, we'll have to wait until July 2026 to see what the Z Fold 8 has in store. Thankfully, we should get plenty of details of Samsung's 2026 foldable before that time, and I'll update this post as and when new information becomes available.</p> ]]></dc:content>

You fill out a quick survey with your age, height, weight, and gender, then log the furthest distance you've run — None, 5K, 10K, half marathon, or marathon — and how fast you finished.</p><p>You must then complete a 12-minute "running test," starting at a "comfortably hard pace" before building to "full speed," and are lastly timed on how quickly your heart rate recovers during cooldown. It's Samsung's equivalent to the lactate threshold test.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nh16o10JOR4" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Based on your survey and test results, Samsung gives you a 1–10 rank; each level has a target distance and pace that you must hit to level up. Levels 1–3 focus on finishing a 5K, 4–5 on 10Ks, 6–7 on a half marathon, and 8–10 on a full marathon.</p><p>For each level, you're given a 3-to-5-week training plan, with tailored runs each week to build up your speed and endurance. Only after you've completed most of your workout plan can you take the "level test" and graduate to the next tier.</p><div ><table><caption>Samsung Running Coach levels</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Level</p></th><th  ><p>Goal</p></th><th  ><p>Test</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>1–3</p></td><td  ><p>Finish a 5K under 35 minutes</p></td><td  ><p><strong>Level 1: </strong>0.93 miles under 10:22 (11:09/mile)</p><p><strong>Level 2: </strong>1.86 miles under 20:45 (11:09/mile)</p><p><strong>Level 3: </strong>3.10 miles under 34:34 (11:09/mile)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>4–5</p></td><td  ><p>Finish a 10K under 1:10</p></td><td  ><p><strong>Level 4: </strong>6:21 miles under 1:09:09 (11:08/mile)</p><p><strong>Level 5: </strong>6:21 miles under 1:08:20 (11:00/mile)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>6–7</p></td><td  ><p>Finish a half marathon under 2:30</p></td><td  ><p><strong>Level 6: </strong>9.32 miles under 1:42:43 (11:01/mile)</p><p><strong>Level 7: </strong>13.1 miles under 2:24:08 (11:00/mile)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>8–10</p></td><td  ><p>Finish a marathon under 5:00</p></td><td  ><p><strong>Level 8: </strong>13.1 miles under 2:20:38 (10:44/mile)</p><p><strong>Level 9: </strong>13.1 miles under 2:17:07 (10:28/mile)</p><p><strong>Level 10: </strong>26.2 miles under 4:48:15 (11:00/mile)</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Each workout plan is "designed to help users train safely for marathons" or shorter distances through "optimized intensity and injury-preventive routines." Samsung says an "experienced runner" should find a program that's right for them, even if Running Coach is "ideal for beginners."</p><p>While the lower levels focus on walking, jogging, and low-intensity runs to build endurance, the higher levels have a wide range of activities: Fartlek runs, repetitions, high-intensity intervals, buildup runs, long slow distance runs, and jogging, among others. That kind of complex variety is vital for increasing your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-i-boosted-my-vo2-max-score-on-my-garmin-watch">VO2 Max</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Kro5Gg67rCeJ8yjD4BEVr3" name="Samsung-Running-Coach-workout-plan-and-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic" alt="A Galaxy phone showing a Level 7 Samsung Running Coach training plan, with Week 1 showing one workout completed with a 96/100 score and three upcoming workouts.

Samsung knows that "serious" runners already gravitate towards <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatche">fitness watches</a> with long battery life. So it's focusing on amateurs, with a gamified system that introduces them to a wide range of workout types, without overwhelming them.</p><p>Running Coach has you complete 3–4 activities a week, but on your own schedule instead of Samsung's. This gives running newbies the leeway to recover from tough runs or give themselves an off-day without worrying about failing the program. You don't need to finish every workout before taking a level test, just enough to improve.</p><h2 id="samsung-running-coach-doesn-t-know-how-to-rank-experienced-runners-2">Samsung Running Coach doesn't know how to rank 'experienced runners'</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="XCmciXRe4BbQSj5DTMJUvS" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-running-level-data" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic worn on a wrist outside, the display showing where Level 7 ranks on a distance timeline and the words "Beginner's half marathon: Level 7" underneath." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XCmciXRe4BbQSj5DTMJUvS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When I took the Running Coach survey, I gave Samsung my last half-marathon pace (1hr:54m), then finished my Watch 8 running test at a 7:09/mile pace. It wasn't my best, as I had to run it on a rolling trail, and I ran too fast at the start, but I figured it would be enough to satisfy Samsung.</p><p>Instead, Samsung placed me in Level 7, the "beginner's half marathon tier," with a target of running a half in 2:24 — 30 minutes slower than I ran during a fairly mediocre (for me) race a month ago. Aside from stinging my ego, my workout training plan just isn't tailored to me.</p><p>My first recommended workout was a 5.5-mile "pace run" with a 3/5 difficulty score at 10:11 pace; I finished it at a 9:52 pace, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-970-review">Garmin Forerunner 970</a> on my other wrist graded it a "low-aerobic run," meaning not that hard. My next run of "high-intensity intervals" will max out at 9:07 pace for five 0.62-mile splits. Trust me, that's mid-intensity for me, at best.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="CGu26zRViJYT3Qwp5nZdtS" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-running-coach-workout" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic showing a Running Coach workout, with a distance of 3.1 miles and a target pace of 9:07." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CGu26zRViJYT3Qwp5nZdtS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I understand that this level-7 training plan isn't for me; it's intended for intermediate runners. However, Samsung needs to do a better job of ranking me or adapting to my average pace, as I can't manually level up. Instead, I would need to retake the 12-minute placement test or complete another 17 workouts at slow paces to qualify for level 8.</p><p>If Samsung let runners choose an HR zone instead of pace as the workout criteria, this would solve the issue and let runners target the intensity that's right for them.</p><p>For now, this Running Coach really is meant to, well, coach slow novice runners. It's a promising beta that <em>could</em> eventually help experienced runners. But so long as it focuses on building up mileage at a slow pace, those who want to get faster at their current race distance will be out of luck.</p><h2 id="the-galaxy-watch-8-classic-has-some-fundamental-issues-for-runners-2">The Galaxy Watch 8 Classic has some fundamental issues for runners</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="HdSZ42pfWvjFAVcANTCmAh" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-Running-Coach-workout-main-screen" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic on a wrist showing a Running Coach workout screen with current pace, distance, average pace, heart rate, and time." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HdSZ42pfWvjFAVcANTCmAh.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="A7raUJXYZo5DkyXtH9BdCh" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-Running-Coach-workout" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic on a wrist showing a Running Coach workout screen with current pace, distance, average pace, heart rate, and time." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/A7raUJXYZo5DkyXtH9BdCh.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Most smartwatches have guided workouts that buzz your wrist if you fall out of the target pace or HR range. Samsung's Running Coach workouts follow this system, but not very well!</p><p>The photos above show the default workout screen, with your current pace, distance, average pace, and HR. The color changes if your HR average is too high or low, but it doesn't say anywhere what the target range <em>is</em>, or say if your current pace is outside the zone.</p><p>Worse, my "current pace" was erratic and incorrect for most of the run. The final tracked pace was 9:58/mile (Garmin measured 9:52), but the watch display usually showed me much slower than that (around 10:20–40), even as I got notifications saying I was on or above pace. Without my Garmin to ground me with actual pace data, I wouldn't have known how fast I was moving at any given moment.</p><p>The <em>most</em> annoying part was how the Watch 8 told me I was "on pace" over and over. I expect a notification when I go off pace and when I'm back on; that's it. Instead, every minute or two, I'd be told whether I was on pace, and I had to check every notification in case I wasn't. It distracted me from my rhythm and rarely conveyed useful info.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FhRNeu5RNenA4azq2pM3QW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-GPS-test-5" alt="A Google Earth satellite map showing the GPS path of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic (blue) and Garmin Forerunner 970 (orange) worn by the same runner." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FhRNeu5RNenA4azq2pM3QW.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ApCPDupunpPbP7Ca7xDzSW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-GPS-test-1" alt="A Google Earth satellite map showing the GPS path of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic (blue) and Garmin Forerunner 970 (orange) worn by the same runner." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ApCPDupunpPbP7Ca7xDzSW.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QXqFQ64DzsAt5fdKsEnqPW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-GPS-test-2" alt="A Google Earth satellite map showing the GPS path of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic (blue) and Garmin Forerunner 970 (orange) worn by the same runner." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QXqFQ64DzsAt5fdKsEnqPW.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2yQ7ursMmxxb7mTjRXCEPW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-GPS-test-3" alt="A Google Earth satellite map showing the GPS path of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic (blue) and Garmin Forerunner 970 (orange) worn by the same runner." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2yQ7ursMmxxb7mTjRXCEPW.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bobqBFDN3EXWWiNYbb9UJW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-GPS-test-4" alt="A Google Earth satellite map showing the GPS path of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic (blue) and Garmin Forerunner 970 (orange) worn by the same runner." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bobqBFDN3EXWWiNYbb9UJW.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>I wonder whether inconsistent GPS data led to the erratic pace data.

Maybe it's for a new album. Maybe it's for nostalgia. But rarely would you expect to enjoy a cover band better than the original.</p><p>That's how I feel about the Motorola Razr Plus 2025, a phone that looks identical to its predecessor, yet still somehow packs all the wonder and fun of the original without introducing anything new. Even stranger, it's the small cover display that I found enjoying the most, not the large, beautiful inner display that folds in half like liquid glass magic.</p><p>This isn't the first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phone</a> I've reviewed for Android Central, by any means. I've spent ample time with Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip line since the second iteration, and I've used camera-focused alternatives from Chinese brands like Vivo. But none of them make a flip phone quite like Motorola, and so much of that is wrapped up in how the cover screen works and how it transforms the flip experience.</p><h2 id="motorola-razr-plus-2025-specs-2">Motorola Razr Plus 2025 specs</h2><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Motorola Razr Plus 2025</p></th><th  ><p>Motorola Razr Plus 2024</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display (internal)</p></td><td  ><p>6.9-inch, pOLED, FHD+, 2640x1080, HDR10+, LTPO 165Hz, 3,000 nits peak brightness</p></td><td  ><p>6.9-inch, pOLED, FHD+, 2640 x 1080, HDR10+, 165Hz LTPO, 3000 nit peak brightness</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display (external)</p></td><td  ><p>4-inch, pOLED, 1272 x 1080, 165Hz, LTPO, 2,400 nits peak brightness</p></td><td  ><p>4-inch, pOLED, 1272 x 1080, 165Hz, LTPO 2400 nit peak brightness</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Chipset</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 </p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 </p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>12GB LPDDR5X</p></td><td  ><p>12GB LPDDR5X</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB UFS 4.0</p></td><td  ><p>256GB UFS 4.0</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 1</p></td><td  ><p>50MP, (f/1.7, 0.8μm) or 12.6MP (1.6μm Quad Pixel), OIS, Instant-all Pixel, Focus</p></td><td  ><p>50MP, (f/1.7, 0.8μm) or 12.6MP (1.6μm Quad Pixel), OIS, Instant-all Pixel, Focus</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 2</p></td><td  ><p>50MP telephoto lens (f/2.0, 0.64um) or 12.6MP (1.28μm Quad Pixel), 2x optical zoom</p></td><td  ><p>50MP telephoto lens (f/2.0, 0.64um) or 12.6MP (1.28μm Quad Pixel), 2x optical zoom</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Selfie Camera</p></td><td  ><p>32MP (f/2.4, 0.7μm) or 8MP (f/2.4, 1.4um) Quad Pixel</p></td><td  ><p>32MP (f/2.4, 0.7μm) or 8MP (f/2.4, 1.4um) Quad Pixel</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Audio</p></td><td  ><p>3 mics, dual stereo speakers, Dolby Atmos, Snapdragon Sound</p></td><td  ><p>3 mics, dual stereo speakers, Dolby Atmos, Snapdragon Sound</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>5G, Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, NFC</p></td><td  ><p>5G, Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, NFC</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Security</p></td><td  ><p>Fingerprint sensor, Face unlock</p></td><td  ><p>Fingerprint sensor, Face unlock</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>4,000mAh, 45W wired charging, 15W wireless charging, 5W reverse charging</p></td><td  ><p>4,000mAh, 45W wired charging, 15W wireless charging, 5W reverse charging</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions (open)</p></td><td  ><p>73.99 x 171.42 x 7.09mm</p></td><td  ><p>73.99 x 171.42 x 7.09mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions (closed)</p></td><td  ><p>73.99 x 88.09x 15.32mm</p></td><td  ><p>73.99 x 88.09x 15.32mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>189g</p></td><td  ><p>189g</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h2 id="the-cover-is-the-headliner-2">The cover is the headliner</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="aJLFMy2Mtb6yPUxpxWUfbG" name="motorola-razr-plus-2025-cover-screen-in-pocket" alt="The Motorola Razr Plus 2025's cover screen hanging out of a pocket" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aJLFMy2Mtb6yPUxpxWUfbG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Unlike book-style foldables — think <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> — the cameras on the flip phones are basically attached to the cover display.

With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a>, Samsung still makes you jump through several hoops to get any app you want on the cover screen for a flawed experience. Motorola's implementation just works like a normal phone, including an app launcher, but it's the notification support that really makes a difference.</p><p>On a Galaxy Z Flip, when you receive a notification and tap it on the cover screen, the phone will often prompt you to unfold it to interact with that app or notification. On a Razr, the app just opens on the cover screen. That's it. Nothing complicated. No unnecessary extra steps or weird apps to install. It's as user-friendly as it gets, and it blows my mind that Samsung still hasn't fixed this problem with its Flips.</p><p>Because of this, I was able to fully enjoy the <em>tiny </em>size of the Razr Plus 2025 instead of getting annoyed that I had to open it constantly. It felt like a true pocket-friendly companion rather than something that was convenient when <em>it </em>wanted to be.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="P7nkzqH8scAMK2gEXz6QBi" name="motorola-razr-plus-2025-mocha-mousse-01" alt="The Mocha Mousse Motorola Razr Plus 2025 tented on a stump" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P7nkzqH8scAMK2gEXz6QBi.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6wsjnadk3hhipceYTc4V7i" name="motorola-razr-plus-2025-mocha-mousse-02" alt="The Glamorous back of the Mocha Mousse Motorola Razr Plus 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6wsjnadk3hhipceYTc4V7i.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rzg5XXeBEBXuv5QbjxGh8i" name="motorola-razr-plus-2025-flex-mode-camera-tented" alt="The Mocha Mousse Motorola Razr Plus 2025 tented on a stump" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rzg5XXeBEBXuv5QbjxGh8i.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>I prefer Motorola's design and build over Samsung's models. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> and 7 are overly flat phones, and I simply do not like flat phones. Having a curve to the edge of a device makes it nicer to hold, easier to open, and better looking overall, in my experience.</p><p>Not only that, but Motorola's use of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/the-motorola-razr-2025-lineups-textures-are-a-sensory-delight">Pantone-certified colors and materials</a> is second to none.

In benchmarks, the Motorola Razr Plus 2025 is slightly faster than a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro</a> but slightly slower than a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Galaxy Z Flip <strong>5</strong></a>.</p><p>While that sounds concerning, real-world performance tells me that it doesn't matter. The only time I ever thought the phone felt slow was when I rebooted it after an update, and it was busy finalizing the update in the background. Most phones have a lag period after updating because of the app optimization process, so this isn't a cause for concern.</p><p>Having a "slower" processor ultimately means that the phone prioritizes battery life over performance, ensuring you won't run out of battery before the day is over. This was once a problem with flip phones, but Razrs solved that problem a while back. Plus, the 45W charging speed leaves Samsung's flip phones in the dust, with a full charge (0-100%) taking only 45 minutes in my testing.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="gSXwJoExFqrGWMRX7PT9iL" name="IMG_20250701_192000634_HDR_PORTRAIT" alt="Photo samples taken from the Motorola Razr Plus 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gSXwJoExFqrGWMRX7PT9iL.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2250px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:133.33%;"><img id="hz6Db8FvnVBnwBSumQ88jL" name="IMG_20250628_163501430_HDR_PORTRAIT" alt="Photo samples taken from the Motorola Razr Plus 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hz6Db8FvnVBnwBSumQ88jL.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2250" height="3000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="rsT8p7soUhgGeicMgLJpyL" name="IMG_20250626_074335664_HDR" alt="Photo samples taken from the Motorola Razr Plus 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rsT8p7soUhgGeicMgLJpyL.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="GJbDHd4sa76CCsjLLrF5vL" name="IMG_20250617_190131183_HDR" alt="Photo samples taken from the Motorola Razr Plus 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GJbDHd4sa76CCsjLLrF5vL.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>More often than not, the camera quality from this phone exceeded my expectations, which, to be frank, were low given Motorola's less-than-stellar reputation for camera quality. I should have expected good quality given the shots my wife has been able to pull off on her <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/one-year-with-the-motorola-razr-plus-2024">Razr Plus 2024</a> over the past year, but it's still nice to be pleasantly surprised.</p><p>I <em>love</em> taking portrait photos with this phone, especially since the cover display makes it so effortless. Taking group photos with this phone using portrait mode is nothing short of stunning, and everyone will regularly say "wow!" when they see the viewfinder on the cover screen. Seriously, it happens every time.</p><p>Motorola included a 2x telephoto camera on this year's model again, opting for moderately better zoom detail over the more useful ultrawide angle lens from the 2023 model. I would still <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025-needs-to-ditch-telephoto-camera">prefer for Moto to revert to having a standard and an ultrawide lens</a> for the 2026 model, especially since the other two Razr 2025 models have this configuration.</p><h2 id="the-moto-ai-quotient-2">The Moto AI quotient</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="tikBTKmmXsniXi77hjaF8i" name="motorola-razr-plus-2025-moto-ai" alt="Moto AI running on the Mocha Mousse Motorola Razr Plus 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tikBTKmmXsniXi77hjaF8i.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of the big highlights of this year is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a>, a suite of new tools designed to be "helpful," as all AI things are marketed to be. The reality is that most of these features sound cooler or more useful than they actually are. Take the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/how-use-moto-ai-playlist-studio">AI-generated playlists feature</a>, for example. It'll generate a playlist of songs based on your request, but it's limited to 10 songs in length and currently only works with Amazon Music.</p><p>Then there's the 'Catch Me Up' feature, designed to summarize your notifications when you've put your phone away for a while. I tried this several times when my phone accumulated dozens of notifications, but overall, it didn't seem particularly helpful.</p><p>The 'Remember This' feature sounded like something I would genuinely love to use. "Save screenshots, notes, and images to your Memory with AI-generated summaries and object recognition technology so that you can recall them later." The problem is that I had no idea where to find them after I saved them, and even after I figured it out, I stopped using the feature when I realized it took several steps to find what it saved.</p><p>There are many great ideas in here, and I think the suite could become <em>very</em> good with more development time. For now, though, it feels half-baked and more like a user study than a final product.</p><h2 id="should-you-upgrade-2">Should you upgrade?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="EgE9fPA9nYMHdvcf6JbhTd" name="motorola-razr-plus-2024-green-with-motorola-plus-2025-mocha-02" alt="The folded backs of the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 in Green and Motorola Razr Plus 2025 in Mocha" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EgE9fPA9nYMHdvcf6JbhTd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you're currently on a Razr Plus 2024, there's no reason to upgrade. Yes, Motorola has upgraded the hinge with titanium and improved dust resistance, but almost everything else about the phone remains the same.</p><p>The cameras are still excellent and often surprise me with their quality, particularly when using portrait mode. The phone features the same 4-year update guarantee as its predecessor. And while I commend Motorola for some of the ideas in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a>, I found nothing in the suite that I used daily.</p><p>Motorola sells the Razr Plus 2025 for $100 less than the Galaxy Z Flip 7. While Samsung offers seven years of software updates for its phone, I don't believe for a minute that any flip phone will last seven years without something breaking. I love foldables and can vouch for their durability, but I've seen numerous folding tests, and none of them suggest that a flip phone will last longer than five years at most.</p><p>Because of that, I recommend grabbing the Razr Plus 2025 over the Z Flip 7.

While the Google Pixel Watch 3 is a fan favorite among Android users, it still pales in comparison to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS smartwatches</a> from Samsung and OnePlus in key areas.</p><p>That's why we're looking forward to the upcoming Google Pixel Watch 4, which aims to address some of these pain points, potentially bringing the smartwatch into true flagship territory. The Pixel Watch 4 hasn't been officially revealed yet, but early rumors and leaks give us an idea of what the next Google Watch might bring. Here's a speculative breakdown of how the Pixel Watch 4 might improve upon the Pixel Watch 3.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-watch-4-vs-pixel-watch-3-pricing-and-availability-2">Google Pixel Watch 4 vs. Pixel Watch 3: Pricing and availability</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="zzk2VgCvX5nP2TDjAAb6jd" name="google-pixel-watch-3-porcelain-on-stands-2.jpg" alt="Pixel Watch 3 41mm and 45mm with Porcelain bands" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zzk2VgCvX5nP2TDjAAb6jd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Google Pixel Watch 4</a> is expected to launch alongside the Pixel 10 series, which will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/made-by-google-2025-how-to-watch-pixel-10-launch-and-what-to-expect">debut at an August 20 event</a>. For reference, the Pixel Watch 3 was announced on August 13, 2024, and became available as of September 10, 2024.</p><p>As for pricing, no current rumors or leaks point to a price change for the Pixel Watch 4. In fact, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/pixel-watch-4-on-vous-devoile-les-prix-en-euros-des-futures-montres-connectees-de-google-60260">a recent leak</a> suggests that the price will remain the same in Europe, which is good news. That would mean you'll pay $349 for a 41mm watch and $399 for a 45mm watch, with optional LTE versions costing another $100 on top of that. However, these prices are unconfirmed and could certainly rise due to inflation and other supply chain factors.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Google Pixel Watch 3</a> is currently available in two sizes: 41mm and 45mm, with prices starting at $349 and $399, respectively. Each size has three colorways: Matte Black and Polished Silver for both models, Champagne Gold as the 41mm exclusive, and Matte Hazel as the 45mm exclusive. The upgrade to cellular connectivity costs an extra $100.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-watch-4-vs-pixel-watch-3-design-and-display-2">Google Pixel Watch 4 vs. Pixel Watch 3: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4WQK9PfiUyFYyQ45s8mKLe" name="Pixel-Watch-renders-01" alt="Pixel Watch 4 renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4WQK9PfiUyFYyQ45s8mKLe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks/ via 91mobiles)</span></figcaption></figure><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/pixel-watch-4-renders-leak-indicate-thicker-build-and-removal-of-charging-pins">Leaked Google Pixel Watch 4 renders</a> might give us an early preview of Google's upcoming smartwatch. Put simply, the Pixel Watch 4 appears to have a questionable design, of these renders turn out to be accurate. They depict the Pixel Watch 4 as being about 2mm thicker than its predecessor, and without rear charging pins visible.</p><p>These design changes could be divisive among Pixel Watch fans. A positive of this change is that the Pixel Watch 4 could switch back to a wireless charging puck for power, rather than the contacts and pins on the Pixel Watch 3. On the flip side, this would mean that the Pixel Watch has changed charging methods three times in four generations, which isn't ideal for continuity.</p><p>Otherwise, the Pixel Watch 4 is expected to retain the same "waterdrop" design language as its predecessors. This time, the bezels might be even slimmer, helping make the newer model feel more modern. If the case size remains roughly the same, we could see the Pixel Watch 4 displays slightly grow compared to the 1.27- and 1.43-inch displays on the Pixel Watch 3.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="XG9XJmxDfFGvgxPD5c2bWj" name="Pixel-Watch-3-trekking-poles" alt="The Google Pixel Watch 3 sitting atop a pair of trekking poles, with the watch face including a step count of 11,800." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XG9XJmxDfFGvgxPD5c2bWj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Google Pixel Watch 3 measures 12.3mm thick, so if these rumors are true, the newer model could be close to 15mm thick.

I took it personally when Samsung estimated that I had "Low" antioxidants, so I spent the past week eating as healthily as possible to see if it made a difference.</p><p>Samsung&apos;s multicolored health sensors look for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/carotenoids">carotenoids</a>, the pigment that gives fruits and veggies their bright red, orange, or yellow coloring; once in your body, they counterbalance the "oxidative stress" generated from poor lifestyle habits like smoking, drinking, overeating, and stress. Hence the name "antioxidants."</p><p>Generally speaking, the antioxidant index is intended to determine whether you&apos;re consuming your WHO-recommended 400g of fruits and vegetables per day. For health-conscious individuals who dislike logging their food daily, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8</a> offers valuable context.</p><p>But since I thought I <em>was </em>eating healthily enough, I decided to cram carotenoid-rich foods into my diet for a week to see whether Samsung would be able to detect the changes properly.</p><h2 id="how-the-antioxidant-index-score-works-on-the-galaxy-watch-8-2">How the Antioxidant Index score works on the Galaxy Watch 8</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="rRqhJfgismGivjVXBGTjuf" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-BioActive-sensor" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic's bottom BioActive sensor with green, red, and blue lights activated when testing your skin for antioxidants." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rRqhJfgismGivjVXBGTjuf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The BioActive sensor's multicolored LEDs that activate when measuring the antioxidant index. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Your body stores carotenoids in the skin, where the Galaxy Watch 8's optical sensors can spot and measure them. Samsung told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/now-i-know-why-the-galaxy-8-watch-antioxidant-sensor-doesnt-use-your-wrist-and-its-so-obvious">TechRadar</a> that your wrist has too many capillaries, so your blood confuses the results; pressing your thumb against the sensor will "push away all the blood" and make it easier to check your carotenoid levels.</p><p>Carotenoids are just one type of antioxidant, but their pigmentation allows Samsung to detect them. We've emailed Samsung to ask if it might eventually track other antioxidants, but for now, carotenoids are the best estimate to check non-invasively if your body has other healthy vitamins and nutrients.</p><p>So, what foods have carotenoids? Samsung suggests <strong>root vegetables</strong> (carrots, sweet potatoes), <strong>leafy greens</strong> (spinach, kale), <strong>citrus fruits</strong> (oranges, mangoes), <strong>tomatoes</strong>, and <strong>bell peppers</strong>. Other carotenoid-rich foods include pumpkin, squash, cantaloupe, and corn; most red, orange, and yellow produce will likely have some.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="e5zrKQnTcq9xMKxpGQhdC4" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-Gemini-Google-Keep-list" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic showing a Gemini-created carotenoid-rich foods list added to Google Keep." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e5zrKQnTcq9xMKxpGQhdC4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2249" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung used data from clinical trials at Samsung Seoul Hospital to determine the "correlation between fruit and vegetable intake and the accumulation of carotenoids in the skin." Adequate antioxidant levels get a score of 75–100. People with "Low" scores (50–75) consume 50–99% of the recommended daily amount, so about a 2% increase per point. Very Low (0–49) is "less than 50%."</p><p>Samsung also warns that your score may fall during "periods of severe stress or when drinking or smoking," so it's about lifestyle as much as nutrition.</p><p>The company says it may change the criteria with "future clinical results," but the gist is that you want a score of 75 to match recommended levels. Everything above that is just gravy, while lower scores leave you vulnerable to "cell damage, excessive aging, inflammation, worsening eyesight, and chronic diseases such as cancer" over time.</p><h2 id="raising-my-antioxidant-index-score-on-my-galaxy-watch-8-2">Raising my Antioxidant Index score on my Galaxy Watch 8</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="D6vjSqfonSvkje2X3yrZUE" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-antioxidant-index-fruits-and-veggies" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic on a person's wrist showing the Antioxidant Index widget with a "Low" score, held in front of two bowls containing colorful fruits and veggies." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/D6vjSqfonSvkje2X3yrZUE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung warns that it can take "up to 2 weeks for your antioxidant index to reflect an increased intake of fruits and vegetables," so I knew that eating a boatload of carotenoids wouldn't instantly level me up. But I wanted to see if there was an obvious impact from a changed diet in the short term.</p><p>I stuck to my normal diet for the first day, and my reading stayed consistent. Starting on Monday, I raided my grocery store for carotenoid-rich fruits and veggies, then spent the next five days eating salads, bell peppers, cantaloupe, and other healthy produce, well above the recommended five servings per day.</p><p>My score did start to course-correct, but slowly. I looked into the benefits of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://now.tufts.edu/2024/09/30/benefits-raw-versus-cooked-vegetables">raw vs. cooked veggies</a> and realized that raw vegetables are high in vitamins and fiber but <em>low</em> in beta-carotenes. You get the most carotenoids from cooked vegetables paired with healthy fats, like cooking oil.</p><p>I'm more of a raw veggies guy than a stir-fry guy, which may be part of my problem. So I tried to incorporate more cooked veggies, paired with meats or peanut butter, during the final stretch.</p><div ><table><caption>My Galaxy Watch 8 antioxidant index scores</caption><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Sunday</p></td><td  ><p>Monday</p></td><td  ><p>Tuesday</p></td><td  ><p>Wednesday</p></td><td  ><p>Thursday</p></td><td  ><p>Friday</p></td><td  ><p>Saturday</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>54</strong></p></td><td  ><p><strong>53</strong></p></td><td  ><p><strong>56</strong></p></td><td  ><p><strong>65</strong></p></td><td  ><p><strong>61</strong></p></td><td  ><p><strong>65</strong></p></td><td  ><p><strong>65</strong></p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>I climbed from an antioxidant index score of 53 (56% of recommended antioxidants) to 65 (80%) in a week.

I'm glad to have this tool as a baseline for my health.</p><p>Here's the main issue with the antioxidant index: there are more antioxidants than just carotenoids. Other types, such as flavonoids, polyphenols, and lycopene, are found in a wide range of fruits, vegetables, beans, and teas, and they all help remove the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/318652">"free radical" molecules</a> that contribute to aging and disease.</p><p>Carotenoids are a key indicator of your health, one that helped me recognize a dietary deficiency. However, since Samsung cannot track other non-pigmented antioxidants as easily, your <em>actual</em> "antioxidant score" might be higher than Samsung can accurately assess with a smartwatch.</p><p>But this isn't a criticism!

If this is what's important for you, all you would need to decide is whether you want an Android phone or an iPhone.</p><p>However, neither of these phones outperforms many other models in terms of other key needs, such as affordability, AI capabilities, or a unique form factor. When we here at Android Central call them the best, we mean best at the things listed above.</p><p>Say you'd rather not spend more than a thousand dollars on a phone and want to get the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best value for your money</a>. Companies like Motorola and OnePlus offer phones that give you a lot to love at a much lower price. You can take this even further and look for the best phone you could buy for $500, and companies like Nothing or Xiaomi are great options. So are Samsung or OnePlus, which makes it a lot more difficult to decide.</p><p>Some criteria make it easier to determine a "best" model. You have a lot fewer choices when it comes to something like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">a phone that folds or flips</a>.

It has a great price, it performs well, and it has a good set of features for its ~$500 price tag.

For me, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025">Moto Razr</a> was a better choice, even though I think the OnePlus is better in many ways.

Maybe you want a cheap phone with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-camera-review">a camera that takes great photos</a> without much fiddling around with settings.

Compared to previous <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a> I've used in the past, this is easily the best, thanks to its sleek design, smooth performance, and surprisingly decent battery life. Yet, while the Fitbit integration is a nice perk of owning a Pixel Watch, there's one niche feature that keeps it from being my go-to gym smartwatch, and it's the reason why I constantly switch to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a> when I work out.</p><p>The Pixel Watch does a great job tracking my workouts, especially my runs (when I actually do them), but it's not so great at keeping track when I lift weights. In fact, it's pretty rudimentary when compared to some other smartwatches, and frankly, I'm surprised that Google hasn't improved on this front with its flagship smartwatch. Heart rate, active calories, and cardio load are all there, but the one thing I <em>really </em>need is automatic rep counting.</p><p>This is something Garmin does very well; even Samsung manages this to some extent. With the focus on more running features in recent years, I would love to see the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Pixel Watch 4</a> add rep counting to its repertoire.</p><h2 id="how-garmin-counts-reps-and-sets-2">How Garmin counts reps and sets</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3603px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="HrvdUFo4cbXfa8iHLEJEjP" name="Garmin-Forerunner-570-workout-screen" alt="The Garmin Forerunner 570 workout screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HrvdUFo4cbXfa8iHLEJEjP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3603" height="2027" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I really like that Garmin can automatically count reps and start or stop sets. This means I don't have to manually do it every time; the watch does it for me. When I'm at the gym, I'm often lost in my music. While I'm not as serious as some of the other guys who jot down their every set in notebooks, I still like to stay on track with my workouts. That said, I often forget what rep or set I'm on, so it's nice to glance at my Garmin watch to check.</p><p>I don't know the ins and outs of how this works, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.garmin.com/en-US/?faq=xEPSpxE3j27gpEsiq8K9o8">Garmin states</a> that it can track "weight training exercises that consist of distinct and consistent motions, such as bench press," as well as "exercises designed to target single muscle groups/body parts." After performing the same movement a few times, it'll register that I am performing a set and will start counting my reps, retroactively adding my first reps to my current ones.</p><p>Once I stop performing those movements, the watch will automatically log that set and enter a resting period, complete with its own timer, so that I'm not over- or under-resting between sets. That rest period will stop once it notices that I've started performing repetitive movements again. Then it will start counting reps on a new set.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RpDQa3apuBcsNLCXE2ggiP" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-3-workout-screen" alt="The Google Pixel Watch 3 workout screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RpDQa3apuBcsNLCXE2ggiP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Things are much simpler on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a>, which just tracks my workout without reps, sets, or rest periods. However, it can automatically detect certain activities, such as running and walking. I feel that Fitbit could utilize the same movement data for weightlifting reps, as Garmin does. Even if it isn't perfect, I think something would be better than nothing.</p><p>I'm not the only one who feels that Google could and should do better. Android Central senior editor Nicholas Sutrich also points out that his Amazfit watch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit/amazfit-balance-2-impressions" target="_blank">makes his Pixel Watch feel like a toy</a>, with a major feature highlight being the ability to log and analyze reps as you work out. And like Garmin, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit/best-amazfit-smartwatches">Amazfit</a> uses this data in a pretty useful way that Google could learn from.</p><h2 id="it-s-not-perfect-but-it-s-better-than-nothing-2">It's not perfect, but it's better than nothing</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3597px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="UD4XTfrMNyGTnbhmbxi4kP" name="Garmin-Forerunner-570-edit-workout" alt="The Garmin Forerunner 570 edit workout set screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UD4XTfrMNyGTnbhmbxi4kP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3597" height="2023" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While the method isn't 100% accurate, Garmin watches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review">Venu 3</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-forerunner-570-review">Forerunner 570</a> do a great job at it, and are either spot on with the counts or off by just one or (at most) two reps. However, if you do notice that something's off, Garmin lets you quickly edit the reps and even input the weight while it counts down to begin the rest period.</p><p>You can also edit the last set if you forget to, or go into the Garmin app to make any changes later.</p><p>It's also important to note that this feature typically only works on workouts where the watch can accurately track your movements. Garmin actually has a list of workouts that are more difficult to track with its watches, so it's important to keep this in mind if you plan to rely on this feature:</p><ul><li>Stationary wrist exercises: dips, pullups, pushups, planks</li><li>Leg isolated exercises: extensions, seated presses, calf raises, hamstring curls</li><li>Complex/hybrid motions: box jumps, “CrossFit” type exercises, burpees</li><li>Short-range exercises: shoulder shrugs</li><li>Battle ropes and jump rope</li></ul><p>In these cases, the watch often won't register that you're even doing anything and will continue to show you in a rest period. As a result, leg day is probably the only time when this feature is not reliable, aside from squats. However, they're generally reliable for weightlifting and can serve as a good alternative to pen and paper.</p><h2 id="it-s-not-just-counting-reps-it-s-so-much-more-2">It's not just counting reps. It's so much more</h2><p>While counting reps, Gamin actually takes this data even further. It uses that movement data to determine what exercises I'm doing. Then, after my workout, it shows me a diagram of the muscle groups that I worked out based on my movements.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1224px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="QiytkJVy2AQXx3yYApXy6" name="Garmin-targeted-muscles" alt="A visual of the targeted muscle groups in a workout." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QiytkJVy2AQXx3yYApXy6.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1224" height="816" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A visual of the targeted muscle groups during a workout session with primarily chest and tricep exercises. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Again, it's not 100% accurate, but it's pretty spot on most of the time, and it's a handy way to visualize my workouts and see which muscles got more focused than others, as well as what I may need to work on the next day or the following week.</p><p>Right now, I enjoy using Fitbit on the Pixel Watch, particularly for the AI-powered running coach, but the post-workout data is often pretty barebones. Adding more metrics like movement data and targeted muscle graphs would go a long way towards enhancing Fitbit for more people who could benefit from that data.</p><h2 id="learn-from-garmin-compete-with-samsung-2">Learn from Garmin, compete with Samsung</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="yHerFynjGJ6kDrNcvmE6Yo" name="Smartwatches-smart-ring-and-smart-glasses" alt="The Google Pixel Watch 3, Garmin Fenix 8, Galaxy Watch Ultra, Ultrahuman Ring Air, and Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yHerFynjGJ6kDrNcvmE6Yo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When Google announced the Pixel Watch 3, it was clear that there is more focus on running features and anything else, as if Google is trying to compete with Garmin to try and steal customers away from its popular Forerunner or Venu series. That may or may not be true, but I think Google should expand the scope of the Pixel Watch beyond just running.</p><p>I'm not saying Google shouldn't add more running features. By all means, I'm sure my colleague Michael Hicks would love to see more Garmin-like features on the Pixel Watch that cater to runners. That said, the Pixel Watch still can't compete with Garmin in terms of battery life or the sheer number of activity/sports modes.</p><p>However, Samsung is a good place to look, and I think Google should shift its focus to competing with the Galaxy Watch wherever it can.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JnqQqwf2BFr5tZiteyF5tY" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-5-Google-Pixel-Watch-glass.jpg" alt="Comparing the curved glass on a Google Pixel Watch with the flat glass on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JnqQqwf2BFr5tZiteyF5tY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When I first bought my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-vs-5">Galaxy Watch 5</a> a few years ago, I was very surprised to see that it automatically counted my reps. This was before I had ever used a Garmin watch, so I was quite impressed to see this feature on a Wear OS watch. That said, it still left a lot to be desired.</p><p>At the gym, it would often count almost <em>any </em>movement as a rep, overestimating the count by quite a bit. It also wouldn't automatically start and stop sets, so I would have to do it manually; otherwise, every movement would count as a rep in a single set. Still, I appreciated that it at least <em>tried </em>to count my reps for me, even if the results were pretty inaccurate.</p><p>The feature was also limited to certain workouts, forcing you to change to specific exercises, whereas Garmin will log whatever you do based solely on your movements. There's no need to specify beforehand what workout you're about to do.</p><p>I haven't had the opportunity to test any newer Galaxy smartwatches, including the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-hands-on">Galaxy Watch 8</a>, but this is at least an area where Google can try to one-up Samsung's fitness efforts by learning from Garmin.</p><h2 id="improved-strength-training-in-the-works-2">Improved strength training in the works?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4WQK9PfiUyFYyQ45s8mKLe" name="Pixel-Watch-renders-01" alt="Pixel Watch 4 renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4WQK9PfiUyFYyQ45s8mKLe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks/ via 91mobiles)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Pixel Watch may not have the battery life to compete with Garmin, but Google has access to a wealth of data and numerous ways to utilize it in ways that will benefit its consumers. I have complete faith that Google could bring features like automatic rep counting to the Pixel Watch, especially if it means giving users a more comprehensive look at their workouts.</p><p>And with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/made-by-google-2025-how-to-watch-pixel-10-launch-and-what-to-expect">Pixel Watch 4</a> right around the corner, I really hope Google throws us a bone and adds more features geared toward weightlifters and bodybuilders. Because, as it stands, I'm either going to continue to rely on Garmin for the gym, or I'll update my aging Galaxy Watch 5 to the Galaxy Watch 8 and make that my go-to smartwatch for everything.</p><p>Fortunately, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/google-pixel-watch-4-strength-training">a recent leak</a> suggests that Google may be looking to improve the strength training experience on the Pixel Watch 4. This may include features like a Workout Builder where users can curate their workouts, warm-ups, and cool-downs. It may also include real-time guidance, form insights, and advanced insights, which sounds a lot like what Garmin provides post-workout.</p><p>Whether or not automatic rep counting is included remains to be seen, but this sounds incredibly positive if it does launch with the Pixel Watch 4.</p> ]]></dc:content>

What exactly you’ll be able to repair, though, is still up in the air. It’s unclear if parts like the battery or cover glass will be replaceable through Google or its service partners.</p><p>This move doesn’t come out of nowhere. Back in September last year, a Google exec mentioned the team was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-repairability-leniency-pixel-watch-report">already “thinking through” how to make Pixel Watches</a>—and other devices—easier to repair.

While there's no word yet on how it'll actually work, this could be the upgrade that makes Pixel Watches truly competitive in the lifesaving tech department.</p><p>Furthermore, the smartwatch is rumored to add a Breathing Emergencies alert. It’ll use the built-in SpO2 sensor to keep tabs on your blood oxygen levels, and if they drop too low, the watch will send a warning to give you a heads-up on possible breathing issues.</p><p>Specs are still mostly under wraps, but these rumored upgrades are definitely ones to watch for when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-officially-sets-a-date-for-its-pixel-10-launch-event">Google takes the stage on August 20</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

But with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chatgpt-could-be-set-as-default-assistant">demand climbing</a>, it’s shifting gears and looking to expand its backend setup and avoid putting all its eggs in Microsoft’s basket.</p><p>This marks the first big move in that shift. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/16/openai-googles-cloud-chatgpt.html" target="_blank">CNBC</a>, OpenAI is about to start running parts of ChatGPT on Google's cloud.

Even though it trails behind AWS and Azure, Google’s cloud setup will now help power OpenAI’s operations in the U.S., UK, Japan, the Netherlands, and Norway.</p><p>This change probably flies under the radar for most users, but it’s a pretty bold shift in strategy. OpenAI, backed by Microsoft and often <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/googles-plan-to-steal-chatgpts-market-share-is-all-about-geminis-free-tier">toe-to-toe with Google in the AI race</a>, is now buying compute power straight from Google. Both have spent billions pushing AI forward, competing in everything from chatbots to search, but now they’re sharing some of the same server space.</p><p>By spreading out its cloud partners, OpenAI avoids getting too tied to just one provider.

Additionally, the leak suggests that the cover display is also getting a brightness upgrade of up to 3,000 nits of peak brightness, a 10% increase from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-fold-changed-my-mind-about-foldables-but-i-still-prefer-flip-phones">Pixel 9 Pro Fold.</a></p><p>The battery might also see a bump with a 5,015mAh capacity, a significant increase from the previous model, and will supposedly support 23W wired and 15W wireless (with Qi2) charging speeds.</p><p>The device's camera capabilities could remain the same this year; however, under the hood, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold might get Google's next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/is-googles-switch-from-samsung-foundry-to-tsmc-for-the-tensor-g5-chip-a-big-deal">Tensor G5</a> chip.

With the next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/made-by-google-2025-how-to-watch-pixel-10-launch-and-what-to-expect">Made by Google</a> event set for August 20 and Galaxy Unpacked behind us, our attention now turns to see what the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-fold">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a> will offer.</p><p>Of course, this won't be the only device announced at the event, as Google's entire flagship phone lineup is likely to see a refresh. And perhaps we'll even see a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Pixel Watch</a> along with some new smart home hardware. Given that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> has arrived, it begs the question of whether you should wait for the Pixel 10 Pro Fold or not.</p><h2 id="what-changes-do-we-expect-for-the-google-pixel-10-pro-fold-2">What changes do we expect for the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold?</h2><p>Before we can make a suggestion, one way or another, we need to put the cards out on the table. Thankfully, leaks and rumors have given us a pretty good indication of what to expect, provided that they ring true. With that, here's a quick rundown of what the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is rumored to bring:</p><ul><li>Slightly larger and brighter cover display (6.3-inch/2,700 nits vs. 6.4-inch/3,000 nits).</li><li>The inner screen remains the same, with a potential bump in peak brightness.</li><li>Google Tensor G5 replaces the Tensor G4, potentially with 16GB of RAM.</li><li>Battery size rumored to increase to ~5,000mAh, and leaks suggest Qi2 compatibility with faster 15W wireless charging.</li><li>It could be the first foldable with an IP68 rating.</li><li>Minimal, if any, camera hardware changes are rumored.</li></ul><p>If the rumors prove true, we're in store for three major upgrades with the Pixel 10 Fold. And at least one of them comes as a huge surprise, especially given the recent slew of new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> that have been released from Samsung, Honor, and Vivo.</p><h2 id="3-reasons-to-wait-2">3 reasons to wait</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eK5yWTTFGhV2NNhMAeyEB8" name="google-tensor-g4-pixel-9-pro-xl-1.jpg" alt="Google Tensor G4 on Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eK5yWTTFGhV2NNhMAeyEB8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The first of which is the most obvious, with Google expected to introduce its Tensor G5.

Before that, the "standard" for foldable phones was an IPX8 rating, meaning that there was no dust protection. However, if Google can pull this off, we'd finally have a foldable phone that is fully protected against dust, managing to get in and wreak havoc.</p><p>And as a result, it might pave the way for more people to consider foldable phones in the future.

The current iteration retails for $1,799, but is often on sale for much less. Meanwhile, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold could come in at $1,599, matching that of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.giztop.com/honor-magic-v5.html">Honor Magic V5's price</a> if you were to import one.</p><p>Provided that the price reduction comes to fruition, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is going to be even more enticing than before. Better performance, bigger battery, lower price, AND an IP68 rating? Yeah, I would definitely wait just a little bit longer for Google's official unveiling of the Pixel 10 Pro Fold.</p> ]]></dc:content>

In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://samsungmobilepress.com/feature-stories/the-breakthroughs-powering-samsungs-thinnest-most-refined-foldables/">a press release</a>, the company detailed the catalysts behind those refinements. The hinge is where Samsung states it started when it came to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/should-you-upgrade-to-the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>. This third-generation Armor FlexHinge cut down the device's profile by roughly 27%, which also made it 43% lighter.</p><p>This new hinge is smaller; however, the post states it keeps the same strength as the bulkier hinge from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">the Fold 6</a>. Another key upgrade is the hinge's wingplate, which Samsung says lets the display lie flatter when fully opened.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="A2nJeXvDmfeKkKp5Rnb3r3" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on-8" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 Lock Screen hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/A2nJeXvDmfeKkKp5Rnb3r3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The display itself boosts Samsung's "flagship quality" even higher by reducing its thickness by 39%. However, the UTG, or ultra-thin glass, materials are 50% thicker. While these two statements might seem to contradict each other, the UTG upgrade helps to reduce the visibility of the phone's crease.</p><p>Hardware-wise, the Fold 7 drops its thickness by half over the series' first-ever launch, measuring 8.9mm when folded. Joining this is an even brighter display at a new 21:9 aspect ratio, which makes its experience much wider, too.</p><p>The Fold 7's camera array features a 200MP lens for the first time. Samsung said it worked to implement a new "thin actuator" and completely redesigned the camera's structure to fit the lens in without compromise.</p><h2 id="the-flip-7-s-unsung-heroics-2">The Flip 7's Unsung Heroics</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="Giex8BdsLmvHvkMXqsBjA6" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on-12" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Giex8BdsLmvHvkMXqsBjA6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1407" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Galaxy Z Flip 7 might feel like an unspoken hero this year, but Samsung says it's reduced its profile to just 13.7mm when folded. That measurement drops even more to 6.5mm when the clamshell is opened. Arguably, the most talked-about aspect of the Flip 7 is its larger, immersive cover display.</p><p>The Flip 7 introduced an edge-to-edge display that wraps around its dual camera lenses. This results in a 4-inch cover screen, fully capable of letting users access AI features, check emails, watch videos, and more.</p><p>Another hidden gem is the device's bezels—they've gotten slimmer, too. Samsung claims the Flip 7 features "the world’s thinnest display bezel" on a foldable. Technically speaking, the phone saw a 68% reduction its its screen bezels, breathing life into its display experience.</p><p>Back when the foldables launched on July 9, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-sheds-the-s-pen-on-the-galaxy-z-fold-7-for-super-slim-design">did so without a notable aspect</a>: the S Pen. Samsung shed the S Pen (and its digitizer) on the device to help thin the phone even more. This is a feature that, while useful, not <em>many </em>people use. The S Pen was useful in various cases for those who loved it, and it'll likely be missed this year. However, there's a chance the S Pen could make a return on a future Z Fold series model.</p><p>Earlier this week, Samsung's executive director of the MX business division, Kang Min-seok, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-will-reconsider-s-pen-return-galaxy-z-fold-7-ditched-it-report">said the company may "reconsider"</a> bringing the S Pen back. This isn't an easy thing to do, according to Kang, as Samsung is thinking about investing R&D resources into "innovative tech" for a thinner S Pen. More importantly, Samsung says consumers should look at the Fold 7 as a "trade-off," adding "where you lose one if you choose one."</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="ea8d5033-0a00-4b56-b599-ddb4fbbea3a4">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n492cdTmAtXoxYWXC3iyrB.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 7 is its thinnest-ever book-style foldable.

After all, we&apos;re technically talking about four phones here — the Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, Pixel 9 Pro XL, and Pixel 9 Pro Fold. Will these devices get cheaper now that they&apos;re being supplanted by newer models, or will they simply be forgotten amidst all of the new-phone hubbub? Let&apos;s discuss. </p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-we-know"><span>What we know</span></h3><p>Earlier this week, Google confirmed that its next Made by Google event would be held on Wednesday, August 20th in New York City, with some sources suggesting that the keynote speech would start at 10am PT. </p><p>An official invite sent to some media outlets supposedly claimed that Google would be using the event to reveal new “Pixel phones, watches, buds, and more.” This suggests that, in addition to the Pixel 10 series, we can expect to get a first look at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Pixel Watch 4</a>, the Pixel Buds 2a, and possibly even Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/my-demo-with-googles-ar-glasses-went-better-than-the-one-on-stage">long-teased AR smart glasses</a>. </p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DLQafRTYoDpJydKNjLLvsB" name="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review-15.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold review -" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DLQafRTYoDpJydKNjLLvsB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>According to some recent leaks and rumors, Google Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro are expected to be powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/is-googles-switch-from-samsung-foundry-to-tsmc-for-the-tensor-g5-chip-a-big-deal">Tensor G5 chipset</a> and boast some upgraded camera tech, new displays, and the largest battery of any Pixel phone to date. The Pixel 10 Pro (and Pro XL) are also expected to receive a price increase of at least $100. As for the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, rumors have suggested that Google is working on a new hinge for its premium foldable, plus some upgraded camera tech and a boost in battery size. The Fold is also allegedly going to receive a $200 price increase, putting it at a steep $1,999.99, right next to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> (don&apos;t get me started).</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-will-the-google-pixel-9-get-cheaper"><span>Will the Google Pixel 9 get cheaper?</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="A5JUsMmXbpHi5T5WexKYy9" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-in-hand-rear.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro XL in hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/A5JUsMmXbpHi5T5WexKYy9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Now for the million-dollar question: will the Google Pixel 9 series get cheaper once the Pixel 10 is out? Well, I have some good news and (potentially) bad news. </p><p>The bad news is that the Google Pixel 9 (and 9 Pro, et al.) probably won&apos;t get an official price decrease once the new models are out, and it&apos;s just as likely that the 2024 flagships will actually become harder to find as the year progresses. After all, when was the last time you saw a Google Pixel 8 that wasn&apos;t refurbished? </p><p>The <em>good </em>news is that Google Pixel 9 deals are pretty easy to find right now. Just last week during Prime Day, we saw <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/amazon-prime-day-google-pixel-deals-2025">Pixel deals</a> that dropped the base model Pixel 9 to as low as $549, while carriers like Mint Mobile are currently slashing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/google-pixel-9/6810275/"><strong>over 50% off the phone</strong></a> when you bundle with a wireless plan. </p><p>In other words, no, I don&apos;t expect the Pixel 9 to get a permanent price decrease when the Pixel 10 is revealed. But given the frequency of discounts on the Google Pixel 9 lineup, you don&apos;t necessarily need one. And don&apos;t forget: we&apos;ll also be seeing a lot of great Google Pixel 10 preorder deals once the flagship lineup is announced on August 20th, so you may be able to skip the last generation altogether. </p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="35af0509-f87b-4ab6-bf8f-35bd0b6556cc">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tnQGJNQVqF2XVQV4KfMbN8.jpg' alt="google pixel 9 square render"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 9</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Small but mighty</strong></em></p><p>Although its soon to be replaced by the Pixel 10, the base model <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a> continues to be one of Google's greatest creations, balancing a sleek, compact frame with powerful hardware and loads of AI-boosted smarts.

The Galaxy Watch 8 comes in two sizes, 40mm and 44mm. The 40mm variant has a 1.34-inch AMOLED screen, whereas the 44mm version has a 1.47-inch AMOLED panel. This means you can't use screen protectors designed for either model on the other.</p><p>With that in mind, the next thing to sort out is whether you want to use a case with your Watch 8 or not. Both sizes have decent case options that come with screen protectors bundled together, adding value. The Tensea 5+5Pack for Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Screen Protector Case 44mm, in particular, offers an insanely good bargain, giving you five robust 9H tempered glass protectors and five hard bumper cases together for just $10.</p><p>If you want to keep things simple, the SPGUARD 4 Pack is perfect for any user. Available in both 40mm and 44mm sizes, this four-pack gives you a cleaning kit as well as four robust pieces of tempered glass for about $8. It's the ideal kit, leaving you plenty of spares after the initial installation.</p><p>Check out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/best-samsung-galaxy-watch-8-bands">best Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 bands</a> while you're shopping for your new Watch 8.

In their statement, the company said its PWM rate has dipped from 2,160Hz to 960Hz; however, this only goes into effect at low brightness. Nothing adds that while the display is still capable of the original rate (2,160Hz), this change should benefit the display's performance at lower brightness levels.</p><p>The spokesperson states, "...we found display performance at low brightness produces the best quality picture with this updated rate, so we have prioritised picture quality for the final retail software."</p><p>The reasoning for this, on a technical level, wasn't expressed by the Nothing spokesperson at this time. Sutrich states he is looking into it, but there wasn't anything concrete in time for publication. Curiously, this isn't the first time a company has decided to drop its PWM rate on a device for its final retail software. Google did this before, too, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">the Pixel 8 Pro</a>.</p><p>Sutrich states that during the timeline around launch, the review unit he received used 480Hz PWM. Once the final rate software was released, things dipped to 240Hz.</p><h2 id="in-the-interest-of-your-eyes-2">In the interest of your eyes</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hFWeEisYyaKLFyLH2x9os4" name="pwm-hero-01" alt="Comparing the dimming technologies between the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL, iPhone 14 Pro Max, OnePlus 13, and Honor Magic 7 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hFWeEisYyaKLFyLH2x9os4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>PWM, otherwise known as "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">pulse width modulation</a>," is a technology used by brands to rapidly turn the display on and off to trick your eyes into thinking the screen's brighter or dimmer. It's this flickering that can cause grueling problems for people who are PWM sensitive. Some people can suffer from eye straight, headaches, dizziness, a sense of vertigo, nausea, and a whole host of other uncomfortable feelings.</p><p>There are some solutions if you've felt anything like this after using your phone for a while. Sutrich suggests locking your phone's display refresh rate, not using it in a completely dark room, and (probably most importantly) visiting the optometrist.</p><p>While the Phone 3's 2,160Hz PWM rate is eye-friendly, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review">the Phone 3a and 3a Pro</a> also received similar treatment.</p><p>Nothing's confirmation of its PWM rate change comes shortly after the company's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/open-sales-nothing-phone-3-and-headphone-1-begin-us-canada">open sales began</a> for the Phone 3 in the U.S. The device starts at $799 with 12/256GB and a 16/512GB RAM/storage configs. Nothing said it has leaned into the flagship appeal of the phone, popping in the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 chip with 50MP camera lenses and a 5,150mAh battery.</p><p>Around launch, Nothing confirmed that it has committed to even more software updates for the Phone 3. The device will receive five major Android OS upgrades and seven years of security updates.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="129a5abb-f1c9-4c72-b395-be3c50cbb3e5">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YePoe5yoNNw8rzpgquX8dY.jpg' alt="An official product render of the white Nothing Phone 3"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Nothing Phone 3</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The Phone 3 is Nothing's "true flagship," boasting notable CPU and GPU improvements over the company's past-gen model.

Samsung is working on smart glasses, and the company's Food Plus service offers a useful alternative to MyFitnessPal.</p><p>Discussing the feature with a Samsung executive on a small panel, it was clear that the potential for this feature is huge, especially as additional form factors become mainstream and the camera-enabled Samsung Smart Fridge evolves.</p><h2 id="vascular-load-while-asleep-2">Vascular load while asleep</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="avKzaRLuUH2r392grnUjWG" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-watch-ultra-2-hands-on-9" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 and Watch 8 Classic BioActive Sensors hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/avKzaRLuUH2r392grnUjWG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The second hero feature is the new Vascular load measurement that occurs while you sleep. Although it may not sound as impressive as the immediacy and quantifiable metrics provided by other features, this could be one of the most important additions to the lineup.</p><p>The majority of cardiac and Vascular infarctions occur while you're asleep, as this is when major underlying health conditions can be most apparent. The stress on my heart culminated in a heart attack five years ago, and recovery involved careful monitoring - in the hospital and at home - of my Vascular system, as a 95% blockage was the root cause.</p><p>The new vascular load feature is designed to measure and monitor whether your heart is pumping blood through your arteries efficiently. It measures the resistance to blood flow (resistive load) and the stiffness of the arteries (pulsatile load) to determine whether your heart is working properly. Too much pressure or too stiff arteries can lead to more serious conditions, including heart failure like mine.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="aoqpLPTXsG4GgSywZYXCYA" name="Samsung-Mobile-Galaxy-Unpacked-July-2025-Galaxy-Watch8-Series-Classic-Ultra-Comfort-PR_main3-F" alt="Vascular Load on the Galaxy Watch 8" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aoqpLPTXsG4GgSywZYXCYA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="563" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This is the type of feature that many people won't need, but for those who do, it could prove to be lifesaving. Had this feature existed five years ago when I had my heart attack, I have little doubt that it could have alerted me to underlying problems and prompted me to seek medical advice before the heart attack occurred.</p><p>Every wearable maker offers some form of cardio monitoring, but far fewer offer to track the stress on your heart. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> does track your cardio load, but not specifically while asleep. The Galaxy Watch 8 is unique in this regard, but I hope I never need to use this feature.</p><h2 id="a-new-holistic-era-for-health-2">A new holistic era for health </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="UUzgZSsfbkWiBwEQGgP7CL" name="Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-2" alt="Galaxy Watch 8 Classic White" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UUzgZSsfbkWiBwEQGgP7CL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>These new features are the latest additions to a long line of features designed to provide a single place to track your health data and offer a holistic overview, complete with personalized recommendations.</p><p>They aren't the only new features, however, as the same executive panel saw Samsung reveal that the Galaxy Watch 8 is the first smartwatch to identify an ectopic heartbeat as one of the possible ECG results.

The Galaxy Watch 7 and all the smartwatches that came before it supported quick-release bands, so you had as many options as there are drops of water in the ocean. With the change to Dynamic Lug connectors, the new Watch 8 and Watch 8 Classic have a far narrower selection of bands. Nonetheless, what's available right now isn't bad.</p><p>Samsung's Watch 8 Classic Sport Band is an ideal partner for the smartwatch. It's easily adjustable, fairly durable, and made of pretty soft rubber that also happens to be waterproof. Plus, there are five different colors to choose from. It's always nice to have a spare rubber or silicone band to match your casual outfit of the day.</p><p>For dressier occasions, consider a leather wristband or a classy metal band. Whether you're a leather person or a steel person, there are great options for both types. For instance, the SPGUARD Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic Stainless Steel Strap is adjustable, comes in two colors, and it's really durable. The links are removable, and the stainless steel clasp offers a snug, secure fit. Since it's made of stainless steel, exposure to water is no issue at all. This isn't the case with leather options, as water destroys leather goods. Sankel's Watch 8 Classic Genuine Leather Band weathers with age, giving it that dashing texture only real leather can deliver.</p><p>And if you can't choose between the two, why not get both? The YEEJOK Metal+Leather Watch Straps two-pack gives you both, though the leather is most likely not genuine. Regardless, it's a fantastic deal for the price of a single watch band, and you get two different styles!</p> ]]></dc:content>

The publication states that Samsung officially registered a new device under the name "Galaxy Z Trifold" earlier this week in South Korea.</p><p>Earlier leaks have suggested that this device could be called the G Fold, based on the way the hinges would work, allowing the device to close inward. However, it might not be the case.</p><p>It seems like the company has applied for a trademark certification on the name, which could mean that the company might stick to the same name at least in its domestic market. "After all, the first version will only be released in South Korea, and perhaps China – but not in Europe or the US," <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.galaxyclub.nl/samsung/galaxy-z-trifold/">Galaxy Club added.</a></p><p>Whether or not Samsung keeps the name, this trademark registration reveals that the device might show up in the Galaxy Z lineup, and the word "trifold" indicates the presence of two hinges, as seen in previous rumors about the phone.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="dxCv6aksvWb5CjoTo88kv3" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on-21" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 200MP camera mode hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dxCv6aksvWb5CjoTo88kv3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The website also adds that the trifold has been given a model number SM-F968N and the internal codename Q7M. And the phone is steadily moving towards a year-end launch. This was backed by another recent mention of the trifold, right from the source itself.</p><p>Samsung's acting head of the device experience division, TM Roh, said during a press interview with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/business/tech-science/20250710/samsung-seeks-to-roll-out-tri-fold-phone-by-year-end-head-of-smartphone-business-says" target="_blank">The Korea Times</a> that the company "(is expected to) launch the tri-fold phone within this year." Roh spoke about those Galaxy trifold rumors, adding that Samsung has not finalized a name for the tri-fold just yet. Unfortunately, Roh's press interview didn't give us any other specifications or features about the tri-fold.</p><p>So far, rumors have indicated that this phone will allegedly fold inward, feature a massive 10-inch display when unfolded, and a slightly thicker build when compared to Huawei's tri-fold <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-is-the-most-exciting-phone-around">Mate XT</a>. The external display could measure about 6.49 inches, but might not support the S-Pen, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-sheds-the-s-pen-on-the-galaxy-z-fold-7-for-super-slim-design">just like the latest Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:896px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.96%;"><img id="EEewB9eJ9NoHjX5FBrgcL7" name="samsung-galaxy-g-fold-one-ui-8-animation-snapshot" alt="Samsung's expected tri-fold's rear panels, as leaked in a One UI 8 animation, showing a triple rear camera array and its cover display." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EEewB9eJ9NoHjX5FBrgcL7.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="896" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:816px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:73.53%;"><img id="LuYcV9XuGoPUSKq2PTxBM7" name="samsung-galaxy-g-fold-one-ui-8-animation-front-display-leak" alt="A leaked snapshot of Samsung's tri-fold's internal display from a One UI 8 animation." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LuYcV9XuGoPUSKq2PTxBM7.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="816" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Apart from those hardware aspects, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/one-ui-8-hints-at-samsung-tri-fold-phone-in-animations-leak" target="_blank">recent leak</a> showcased <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/how-install-one-ui-beta" target="_blank">One UI 8 </a>animations on the alleged trifold device, including its functions. One animation demonstrates the trifold's folding process, where the left-most portion opens, revealing its full display.</p><p>The animation shows that two hinges fold inward, but the left and right panels are of different sizes. The former is much smaller, meaning that it needs to be folded first. This is backed up by One UI 8's warning animation that says users should not fold the panel with the camera array first when closing.</p><p>That said, TECNO <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-phones/tecno-phantom-ultimate-g-fold-concept-fully-revealed-showcase">may have beaten Samsung to the punch</a> and unveiled its Phantom Ultimate G Fold concept today (July 17). The phone sports a "G-style" inward folding design with two hinges, with a thickness that is "comparable" to a regular book-style phone (think Z Fold 7), but its open state measures 3.49mm thin.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Just one tap, and your pinned favorites were all right there.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:220.00%;"><img id="C4NF4Gpo8JuknAskETu5Sm" name="Google-Phone-app" alt="new UI for the Google Phone app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C4NF4Gpo8JuknAskETu5Sm.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="2376" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:220.00%;"><img id="diyeRk3jMNsB5K5eFDacLm" name="Google-Phone-app" alt="new UI for the Google Phone app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/diyeRk3jMNsB5K5eFDacLm.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="2376" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:220.00%;"><img id="rkvCXxc9gFaSZsb2zQzXLm" name="Google-Phone-app" alt="new UI for the Google Phone app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rkvCXxc9gFaSZsb2zQzXLm.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="2376" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:220.00%;"><img id="6hZD8ji9oX2WoWq8VffSLm" name="Google-Phone-app" alt="new UI for the Google Phone app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6hZD8ji9oX2WoWq8VffSLm.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="2376" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:220.00%;"><img id="V4w8VRhMSbo7MmfdYLgSLm" name="Google-Phone-app" alt="new UI for the Google Phone app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V4w8VRhMSbo7MmfdYLgSLm.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="2376" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Last month’s leak displayed an “Add” button at the end of the favorites row, likely meant for quickly adding more contacts. But in the official rollout, that button is nowhere to be found.</p><p>The refreshed design leaves the bottom bar looking a bit bare, with only “Recents” and “Contacts” left standing. While the layout feels cleaner, it comes at a cost, as Google quietly dropped the “Frequents” section.

T-Mobile 5G Home Internet is meant for folks who need something flexible and cheap, without a bunch of hidden fees or a complicated multi-year contract. In that regard, it&apos;s an awesome service. </p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2001px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:48.73%;"><img id="rSi2zXfYHKogaSYyy8izka" name="t-mobile-5g-home-internet-plans-169.jpg" alt="A graph showing details behind T-Mobile's 5G Home Internet plans" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rSi2zXfYHKogaSYyy8izka.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2001" height="975" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: T-Mobile)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Rely plan starts at $50 per month using AutoPay (or $35 per month when you bundle with a wireless line), while the Amplified plan costs $60 per month using AutoPay ($45 when you bundle). The best internet plan, called All-In, is also the most expensive, starting at $70 with AutoPay or $55 when you bundle with voice.</p><p>All taxes and fees are included in the price, and again, there are no monthly equipment fees or no pesky annual contracts to worry about when you get your bill. If you&apos;re not totally sold on T-Mobile&apos;s 5G Home Internet, you can also test drive the service for 15 days and get all of your money back if you&apos;re not feeling it. T-Mo will even pay for the shipping. Needless to say, there are plenty of good reasons to consider T-Mobile&apos;s 5G Home Internet if it&apos;s available in your area. The free Mastercard is just the cherry on top. </p> ]]></dc:content>

We're <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/made-by-google-2025-how-to-watch-pixel-10-launch-and-what-to-expect">expecting a handful of announcements</a>, including the Google Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 XL, and Pixel 10 Fold. Phew.</p><p>However, while new hardware is always exciting to see unveiled, is it actually worth waiting for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10" target="_blank">Google Pixel 10</a>, or should you opt for a discounted Pixel 9 instead? The answer to this question varies greatly depending on which model you're looking to pick up, so let's take a look at what we're expecting Google to unveil and how it compares to the Pixel 9 family.</p><h2 id="should-you-wait-for-the-google-pixel-10-2">Should you wait for the Google Pixel 10?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YhgbdKvBinXscM3et53NUf" name="Made-by-google-2024-poster" alt="Google 2024 poster" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YhgbdKvBinXscM3et53NUf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you're excited about Google's smallest, most affordable phone in the Pixel 10 lineup, I recommend waiting for the Pixel 10. Of all the models, the base Pixel 10 looks to be getting the most changes compared to the currently available Pixel 9. Here's a quick breakdown based on rumors:</p><ul><li>Faster processor (~25% per rumors)</li><li>A telephoto camera (5x optical zoom <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10-alleged-prototype-surfaces-chinese-auction-site-spotted">according to leaks</a>)</li><li>New sensors for the main and ultrawide cameras</li><li>Larger batteries</li></ul><p>We don't expect any physical design changes from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-vs-pixel-9">Pixel 9 to the Pixel 10</a> other than the addition of that third camera on the back. This new camera would mark the first time Google has put a telephoto camera on a base Pixel model. One of the biggest reasons to choose the Pro model in the past was for the telephoto camera, so this makes the decision to get the base Pixel 10 much easier than in the past.</p><p>It's rumored that Google will be using smaller main and ultrawide camera sensors to fit this new telephoto camera in. While that sounds like a downgrade at first, we had this same concern with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">Pixel 9a</a> — which featured smaller sensors than the Pixel 8a — but it turned out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-9a-camera-review">that the camera was just fine</a>. In other words, the Pixel 10 should be a camera upgrade on all counts.</p><p>Additionally, the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/is-googles-switch-from-samsung-foundry-to-tsmc-for-the-tensor-g5-chip-a-big-deal" target="_blank">Tensor G5 processor</a>, which is expected to debut in the Pixel 10, is reportedly around 25% faster than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> in the Pixel 9. That's a big deal because Tensor speeds have been generally stagnant for years, and the latest leaked benchmarks are showing that the G5 is comparable to last year's best Snapdragon processor — a huge improvement over the Pixel 9.</p><p>Lastly, Google is reportedly increasing the battery capacity by a small amount. The Pixel 10 is rumored to ship with a 4,970mAh battery, while the Pixel 9 had a 4,700mAh battery. That might not make a huge difference in daily usage, but it could help get you through the end of the day without having to top up.</p><h2 id="should-you-wait-for-the-google-pixel-10-pro-or-xl-2">Should you wait for the Google Pixel 10 Pro or XL?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wHbb3wfTxJGGpk9rwKdb5b" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-hazel-back-2025-01" alt="The Hazel Google Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wHbb3wfTxJGGpk9rwKdb5b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Fold leaks have shown some interesting changes, the Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/googles-pixel-10-pro-and-xl-cameras-may-see-no-upgrades-leak-reveals">look less exciting</a>. If I had to buy a phone today and I was buying a Pixel, I'd just get the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a> and be done with it. Here's what we expect to see when Google announces these phones in mid-August, per rumors:</p><ul><li>Faster processor (~25% per rumors)</li><li>Larger batteries</li><li>Faster PWM rate</li></ul><p>That's not a lot of changes year-over-year, and it makes for a less exciting August for Pro model fans. But that doesn't mean there won't be <em>any</em> upgrades, as the Tensor G5 upgrade could be worth it alone if you're into mobile gaming. A slight increase in battery sizes of about 150mAh for each model also means just a tad more juice to get through your day. Charging speeds are likely the same between the Pixel 9 and Pixel 10.</p><p>The latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/12793905">Geekbench leak</a> for the Pixel 10 Pro Fold reveals that the Tensor G5 is performing at speeds comparable to those of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, marking a significant improvement. Comparatively, the Tensor G4 performed roughly equivalent to a Galaxy S22 Ultra on a good day. That still means that Tensor doesn't match phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> in terms of speed, but it might be enough to make up the difference for mobile gamers.</p><p>Folks who are sensitive to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a> have been unable to use Pixel phones for a long time, but the Pixel 10 Pro line could change that with an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-display-leak-pwm-dimming-rate" target="_blank">improved PWM rate</a> and a rumored accessibility feature for those with extra sensitivity. As someone who is PWM sensitive, this is music to my ears, meaning I could enjoy using a Pixel full-time again without getting a headache.</p><h2 id="how-about-the-cost-2">How about the cost?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wxQnJGSpMcP8n4fwqZfq3b" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-hazel-back-with-box-2025-01" alt="The Hazel Google Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wxQnJGSpMcP8n4fwqZfq3b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We've seen rumors that the Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro will retain the same MSRP as the equivalent Pixel 9 models, but the Pixel 10 Pro XL is apparently getting a $100 price increase. During Prime Day, we saw the Pixel 9 Pro go for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-9-pro-prime-day-deal-2025">as low as $734</a>, and it's clear that stores like Amazon and Best Buy are looking to get rid of their stock before the Pixel 10 needs to be on shelves.</p><p>If you're in the market for a base Pixel 10, I say wait. The changes look to be big enough to justify your patience, even if you'll end up spending more than if you picked up a discounted Pixel 9 right now. Folks interested in a Pixel 10 Pro or Pixel 10 Pro XL are safe to grab a cheap Pixel 9 Pro/XL right now unless they fall into either of these two categories: gamers, and PWM sensitive people.</p><p>Gamers should wait for the Pixel 10 as the extra performance from Tensor G5 will likely make mobile games on a Pixel worth playing. PWM-sensitive people should wait to see what Google has in store for the Pixel 10 Pro series, as we've been told Google is working on something specifically for this subset of users.</p><p>If the Pixel 10 Pro XL ends up receiving the rumored $100 price bump, there's almost no reason to recommend buying that model over a discounted Pixel 9 Pro XL. Based on current trends, that means the Pixel 10 Pro XL would end up being roughly $400 more than the Pixel 9 Pro XL when it's on sale, and no upgrade is worth that kind of cost.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The tipster boldly states Samsung's recent Fold 7 "is the thinnest folding mobile phone in the world." According to their test, which showcased both foldables side by side on a table, the Fold 7 appeared ever-so-slightly thinner than the Magic V5.</p><p>To illustrate this, Ice Universe placed objects (cards) across the tops of both devices. When set down, the card just barely teetered downward toward the Fold 7. Subtle tests with items showed that the Fold 7 appears to have a minuscule edge over the Magic V5 in thinness.</p><p>Ice Universe ran the devices through a quick caliper test, which shed more light. In their test, the Magic V5 resulted in an 8.95mm measurement, while the Fold 7 saw 8.79mm.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:448px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:133.93%;"><img id="d7ySGTBL25VgSHobH5YUiA" name="honor-magic-v5-foldable-caliper-thin-measurement" alt="Honor's image of a caliper's 8.8mm measurement for the Magic V5 foldable, delivered to a publication after reports claim it is not the thinnest." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/d7ySGTBL25VgSHobH5YUiA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="448" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Honor)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Despite the tipster's "rigorous" testing, the publication received a statement from Honor about the matter.

Since style is subjective, I'll focus on the more quantifiable second perk: Is the rotating bezel worth it, and will you like how Samsung changed it?</p><p>Both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6 Classic</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-review">Watch 4 Classic</a> had rotating bezels around their displays, hearkening back to the original Tizen OS Galaxy Watch design. Physical controls define the "Classic" experience as much as the retro chic; it's why so many Samsung watch fans skip alternating years to avoid the mainline models' digital bezel.</p><p>I'm thrilled to have swapped back to a Classic design after using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> for a year, even if it meant losing battery life for exact controls. But there's one change to the bezel that's more about looks than utility, to which Classic veterans will have to adjust.</p><h2 id="the-galaxy-watch-8-bezel-is-different-from-its-predecessors-2">The Galaxy Watch 8 bezel is different from its predecessors</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:772px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="W55LopxCgD7TF5Y6u4oDvX" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-original" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy Watch (2018) held in someone's hand, showing a Classic-style bezel and watch face." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/W55LopxCgD7TF5Y6u4oDvX.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="772" height="434" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">The original Samsung Galaxy Watch design </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Martonik / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YiYZEZj5ZbvfudbQ5tR7AT" name="best-samsung-watch-bands-hero.jpeg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 worn on someone's left wrist, showing an analogue watch face and steel rotating bezel." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YiYZEZj5ZbvfudbQ5tR7AT.jpeg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">The Samsung Galaxy Watch 3, still running Tizen OS </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2046px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="v5QX8MJxuvzmhF4wA99R3b" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-4-Classic-fitness-wide.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic fitness" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v5QX8MJxuvzmhF4wA99R3b.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2046" height="1151" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">The Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Daniel Bader / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="khezkUUeGhoiWqmULtAGF5" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-6-Classic-rotating-bezel-workouts.jpg" alt="Selecting a workout on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/khezkUUeGhoiWqmULtAGF5.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">The rotating bezel on the Galaxy Watch 6 </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Look at the Galaxy Watch, Watch 3, Watch 4 Classic, and Watch 6 Classic in the slideshow above. Samsung gave each rotating bezel tiny ridges that add grip but don't feel too rough against your fingertips. On my Watch 6 Classic, I appreciated how only the bottom half of the bezel is ridged, so it feels completely smooth to turn when I grip from the top.</p><p>Designed with function in mind, these bezels are subtle compared to luxury watches' rotating bezels; those are designed for diving, with thick, striking ridges that aren't as comfortable to turn but make a statement.</p><p>The Galaxy Watch 6 Classic lacks the 60-second markings along the border that were present on the Watch 1, 3, and 4 Classic. Samsung attempted to emulate this look with "classic" watch faces, but from the wearer's perspective with the display dimmed, the last Classic appeared somewhat bare-bones, similar to other smartwatches.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2766px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NmCkQeqkBb8gdoDpyGNGsZ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-display" alt="A close-up of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic showing the default watch face, display border, and rotating bezel." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NmCkQeqkBb8gdoDpyGNGsZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2766" height="1556" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Now look at the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic bezel. Its ridges are deeper and extend to the top, so you get plenty of texture against your fingers every time you turn it. And Samsung brought back the 60-second scale around the display, which gives the Classic a bit of <em>class</em>.</p><p>The problem, of course, is that Samsung sacrificed comfort for style. I wouldn't necessarily call the Watch 8 Classic bezel <em>un</em>comfortable, but it does press into your fingers as you grip it. I turn it more deliberately than my Watch 6 Classic bezel.</p><p>But since people are paying for a distinct look as much as improved controls — and since the bezel balances out the thick, Ultra-esque look of the Watch 8 series — I think the new bezel was the right choice. And since Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/new-galaxy-watch-8-tiles-are-best-part-of-one-ui-8-watch">improved the Watch 8 Tiles</a> to fit more information per Tile, I don't usually need to turn the bezel that much to find what I need.</p><h2 id="why-the-galaxy-watch-8-classic-bezel-is-or-isn-t-worth-it-2">Why the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic bezel is (or isn't) worth it</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="zSwRvnjnfP2PpmQKhDizXG" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-watch-ultra-2-hands-on-11" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 and Watch 8 Classic hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zSwRvnjnfP2PpmQKhDizXG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Watch 8 (<em>left</em>) and Watch 8 Classic (<em>right</em>) </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The old Classics cost $100 more than the base models, offering more flair but no new features. Samsung made the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic $150 more, whether because of tariffs or inflation. You get double the storage and the third Quick Button in exchange, but these alone aren't worth the upgrade if you don't like the Classic's whole raison d'être.</p><p>Is the physical bezel worth paying extra for? It lets you turn to the exact Tile, notification, or menu you want, with <em>clicks</em> marking each turn that I find satisfying, but others might find annoying.</p><p>Galaxy Watches' default digital bezel makes it way too easy to scroll past things, but it's also faster once you master it, and you may prefer a quick single-finger scroll to the two-finger grip the Classic demands. I don't, but you might!</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="QojuSoMeMS9vQvpu2wAaA6" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-close-up-on-bezel" alt="Close-up of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic's rotating bezel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QojuSoMeMS9vQvpu2wAaA6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I appreciate how I can check notifications or Tiles with a single scroll, my wrist still sitting on my desk as I type. This might sound small, but not having to tap the display or lift it to my eyes to check something is highly convenient.</p><p>If you regularly work out, you'll appreciate the option to scroll through data fields via bezel instead of relying on sweaty finger swipes. But some will accept less exact controls for a lighter Watch 8 fit.</p><p>Overall, I much prefer using the Watch 8 Classic to its standard and Ultra siblings for everyday use, and I also think the bezel adds a distinctive look that the other two lack. But this new design only fits a 1.34-inch display, so if you're accustomed to a 1.5-inch display, you'll have to skip the bezel.</p><p>If I were <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/should-you-upgrade-to-samsung-galaxy-watch-8-or-watch-8-classic">upgrading to the Watch 8 series</a>, the Classic would be my first choice, especially with a Watch 6 Classic trade-in.

Maybe we should look at 2026 for this supposed battery capacity boost. The publication speculates we could see this rumored power boost sometime this year, so we'll have to see what happens.</p><h2 id="staying-off-the-charger-for-longer-2">Staying off the charger for longer</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1660px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.78%;"><img id="Fa4Wfi2S6B5R5vcYYcNQrR" name="honor-magic-v5-foldable-launch-hero" alt="The Honor Magic V5 in Dawn Gold." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Fa4Wfi2S6B5R5vcYYcNQrR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1660" height="926" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Honor)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Honor consumers would likely enjoy these rumored battery increases, especially when you look back at the company's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">previous Pro flagship phones</a>. The Honor Magic 7 Pro, which saw a global debut earlier this year in January, debuted with a 5,270mAh battery. While this is smaller than the Chinese variant (5,850mAh), the Magic 7 Pro still rocks the brand's third-gen silicon tech. The phone can last an entire day, even through some heavy use, so it wasn't too bad of a compromise.</p><p>The Magic 7 Pro's silicon battery tech from Honor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honors-silicon-battery-tech-makes-the-magic-7-pro-stand-out-even-more">already made the phone stand out</a> around the time of its launch. According to our very own Harish Jonnalagadda, this technology means Honor's batteries will have "higher density." In short, "brands can leverage this tech to add bigger batteries without increasing the size or weight of their phones, and that's always a good thing."</p><p>On the other hand, we have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-review#section-honor-magic-6-pro-battery-life">the Magic 6 Pro</a> and its 5,600mAh battery. Heavy to medium use saw similar durations with the 7 Pro. If the tipster is believed, bumping future flagships to 7,000mAh or higher would do wonders for the devices, as users can likely go even further on a single full charge.</p><p>One outlier <em>might </em>be its foldable, specifically <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-launches-magic-v5-foldable-yoyo-ai-features-launch">the Magic V5</a> and future iterations of it. Honor really honed in on shaving it down to make it thinner. Considering Honor's battery tech use, perhaps it can implement larger batteries while keeping its future Magic V foldables incredibly thin.</p><p>The Magic V5 sports a 6,100mAh battery based on Honor's "razor-thin" silicon-carbon battery technology.</p> ]]></dc:content>

However, when fully opened, TECNO states its G Fold's "ultra-slim" profile measures out to 3.49mm.</p><p>TECNO credits its development process for fine-tuning the phone's display, materials, and hinges to achieve such a thin measurement, despite its form factor.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xCHthmoDqaEGdSDnBBXQ3G" name="tecno-phantom-g-fold-full-concept-closed-snake-g-fold" alt="The TECNO G Fold concept features an inward folding "G" mechanic, that looks like a snake." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xCHthmoDqaEGdSDnBBXQ3G.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: TECNO)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FweZ8rfypBxfeXGu8ALL4G" name="tecno-phantom-g-fold-full-concept-open-thin" alt="The TECNO Phantom Ultimate G Fold fully open, showing off its incredibly thin profile." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FweZ8rfypBxfeXGu8ALL4G.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: TECNO)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HZheqrcRs52ygUQnU2vJ5G" name="tecno-phantom-g-fold-full-concept-closed-cover-display" alt="TECNO's G Fold concept fully closed, showing off its cover display that feels close to a regular smartphone." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HZheqrcRs52ygUQnU2vJ5G.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: TECNO)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The Phantom Ultimate G Fold's hinge is a shining highlight for TECNO. The post states the device's concept receives an "innovative G-style design" for its hinges. The G Fold offers two hinges, one for each inward folding display. These hinges aren't created equally, as TECNO states the right side boasts a smaller waterdrop hinge, while the left side is a "larger primary" hinge.</p><p>The right side folds in first and then the left. TECNO states both inward folding displays offer a "gapless and secure" experience, to ensure the screens—especially the center—remain safe.</p><p>When fully unfolded, TECNO says the G Fold delivers a 9.94-inch display "with minimal creasing." Additionally, the company highlights the G Fold's multi-angle hovering, thanks to its "dual-cam" design. The post teases that the concept allows for users to utilize the phone in a partially folded state to get quick bouts of work done before moving on.</p><p>The Phantom Ultimate G Fold is still a concept, but TECNO teases its specifications, which claim to not compromise on the flagship experience. The G Fold is expected to be powered by a high-performance chip with a triple camera array and a battery that's over 5,000mAh.</p><p>TECNO is expected to fully showcase the Phantom Ultimate G Fold during MWC 2026.</p><h2 id="concept-revealed-2">Concept Revealed</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uDeTbeq5aaTuNwtk25zAPL" name="tecno-phantom-g-fold-full-concept-rear-panels" alt="The TECNO G Fold concept from behind, showing off its three panels and triple camera array." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uDeTbeq5aaTuNwtk25zAPL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: TECNO)</span></figcaption></figure><p>TECNO has been gearing up for a complete reveal <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-phones/tecno-new-phantom-ultimate-g-fold-tri-fold-concept-tease">of its G Fold concept</a> for a while now.

Think about the sensory aspect of a watch band, in addition to regular things like the price and style of the band. While the collection of Watch 8 compatible straps isn't as diverse as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/best-samsung-galaxy-watch-7-bands">Watch 7's quick-release bands</a>, what's on the market is more than sufficient.</p><p>Before shopping for Watch 8 bands, identify the sort of material you'd like to add to your collection. I like to have at least one fabric, one metal, and one rubber or silicone option with my primary wearable. This is a good framework to o by if you wear your smartwatch every day, wherever you go.</p><p>Since the Watch 8 already comes with a Classic Sport Band, you may or may not be interested in getting one. However, it's always a good idea to have a spare secondary color that you can switch to. This soft rubber band is gentle on the skin, easily adjustable, and durable, which is why it's the best overall pick when seeking out Watch 8 bands.</p><p>Next, consider spicing up your Samsung Galaxy Watch 8's wardrobe with a different texture. A metal band is a must-have. The Miimall Metal Band for the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 is astonishingly affordable, plus it comes in black and silver to match the two <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/which-samsung-galaxy-watch-8-color-should-you-buy">colorways of the Watch 8</a>. Since it's made of stainless steel, it is not susceptible to rust. You get a screwdriver in the box, allowing you to open up links to manually adjust the size of the metal band at home. It's a fantastic budget buy.</p><p>Lastly, consider a fabric option like the durable Spigen Athlex Air or the Hexasider Stretchy Nylon Band. I use my Spigen woven band every day when working out, going to work, or just taking a leisurely stroll outdoors. While the one I use with my Pixel Watch isn't available for the Galaxy Watch 8, I am confident the Spigen Athlex Air will be just as rugged and comfortable. If you want something softer and elastic, the Hexasider Stretchy Nylon Band is also a great choice. And, it comes in a wide range of fun colors to boot.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This is something Pixel fans have been asking for for years, and it's nice to see Google delivering on that front. The Pixel 9 Pro was a mature leap forward in design, and it had some of the best AI features to come in an Android phone.</p><p>However, it wasn't without its flaws. The display still had a draconian PWM dimming rate; the processor simply wasn't suited for competitive gaming, and the measly 128GB base storage was a low blow for a phone that was more expensive than its predecessor.</p><p>All those who skipped the 2024 model in the hopes of getting the Pixel 10 Pro this year are probably not going to be too happy. The Pixel 10 series is expected sometime in August, and going by the leaks so far, it doesn't appear to be drastically different from the 9 Pro. This begs the question when comparing the Google Pixel 10 Pro vs. Pixel 9 Pro — is it really worth waiting for?</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-pro-vs-pixel-9-pro-design-and-display-2">Google Pixel 10 Pro vs. Pixel 9 Pro: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JUWqYvwqm6NB7ycFJnFzV9" name="Pixel-10-pro-prototype" alt="Pixel 10 Pro leaks in all angles" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JUWqYvwqm6NB7ycFJnFzV9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Mystic Leaks)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Our best look at the Pixel 10 Pro comes from this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/googles-pixel-10-pro-and-xl-cameras-may-see-no-upgrades-leak-reveals">alleged hands-on photo</a> posted by Mystic Leaks. The phone looks virtually identical to the 9 Pro except for the rear camera bar, which looks visibly larger. This increase in size has seemingly been further confirmed thanks to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/thinborne-designed-pixel-10-cases-sold-out">Thinborne's new cases for the Pixel 10 series</a>, which are apparently already sold out.</p><p>It's unsurprising that Google hasn't made any drastic changes to the design, as it underwent a major overhaul just last year. I'm sure we'll see a few nips and tucks in the construction and layout of things, but the Pixel 10 Pro should largely look and feel the same. We would love a lower weight, though, as the 9 Pro is not exactly light at nearly 200g.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a> is already built extremely well, so there wasn't much to change in the first place. The front and back have Gorilla Glass Victus 2 for scratch resistance, and there's an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance. The protruding rear camera island didn't win over everyone, and it remains on the 10 Pro as well. The Pixel 10 Pro should have the exact same weather resistance and rugged construction.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jZKFCDntMzraETuRSpvG8E" name="google-pixel-9-pro-in-hand-screen.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro in hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jZKFCDntMzraETuRSpvG8E.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Pixel 9 Pro features a 6.3-inch OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate, up to 3,000 nits of peak brightness, and a high pixel count of about 495 ppi. The one thing that we didn't like about it was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">awful 240Hz PWM dimming rate</a>, which can cause severe headaches if you're eyes are sensitive to flicker. Pretty much everyone in the industry has moved to a higher PWM rate or has switched to DC dimming entirely, but not Google.</p><p>There's no evidence to suggest that the Pixel 10 Pro's display is going to be much different. This means we're looking at the same size, resolution, and brightness specs in all likelihood. There's a ray of hope, though, that Google might have fixed the PWM dimming issue in the 10 Pro. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/potential-display-dimming-update-for-google-pixel-devices">Google exclusively told Android Central</a> this April that its teams "are aware and investigating this" and that "you can expect updates later this year." This last piece of the puzzle could put the Pixel 10 Pro's display among the best, alongside the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-pro-vs-pixel-9-pro-hardware-and-specs-2">Google Pixel 10 Pro vs. Pixel 9 Pro: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5KEfivy8DJxt7Qw5SeUodQ" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-4.jpg" alt="Pixel 9 Pro XL back view against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5KEfivy8DJxt7Qw5SeUodQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's no word on the pricing for the Pixel 10 Pro, but we expect the price of the smaller Pro to remain the same, considering Google raised it just last year. This means it should be $999 for the 10 Pro's 128GB, and there'll be two more storage tiers after this. The 10 Pro XL should be $100 more across variants, according to rumors. A recent leak suggests that Google might rejig the storage tiers of the XL model and start with 256GB. Honestly, I hope it does that for the standard Pro too, as 128GB is way too low these days, especially for a "Pro" phone.</p><p>The Pixel 9 Pro is still sold at the above prices at most places, unless you purchase it during a sale or through your carrier. Once the Pixel 10 Pro hits shelves, though, the 9 Pro's price will come down. Whether it makes a good deal or not totally depends on the discount, but if it's not more than $100, you might as well spring for the 10 Pro.</p><div ><table><caption>Specifications</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel 10 Pro (speculative)</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel 9 Pro</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>Android 16</p><p>Seven years of OS upgrades</p><p></p></td><td  ><p>Android 14 (upgradeable to Android 16)</p><p>Seven years of OS upgrades</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.3-inch 120Hz Actua OLED, 1280 x 2856, HDR, Gorilla Glass Victus 2, 3,000 nits peak</p></td><td  ><p>6.3-inch 120Hz Actua OLED, 1280 x 2856, HDR, Gorilla Glass Victus 2, 3,000 nits peak</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Tensor G5</p></td><td  ><p>Tensor G4</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>128GB/ 256GB/ 512GB</p></td><td  ><p>128GB/ 256GB/ 512GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear cameras</p></td><td  ><p>50MP main + 48MP telephoto + 48MP ultrawide</p></td><td  ><p>50MP main + 48MP telephoto + 48MP ultrawide</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Front camera</p></td><td  ><p>42MP</p></td><td  ><p>42MP</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ingress protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Global 5G, Satellite SOS (U.S.), Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC</p></td><td  ><p>Global 5G, Satellite SOS (U.S.), Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Security</p></td><td  ><p>Ultrasonic fingerprint sensor</p></td><td  ><p>Ultrasonic fingerprint sensor</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>4,870mAh</p></td><td  ><p>4,700mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>152.8 x 72 x 8.6mm</p></td><td  ><p>152.8 x 72 x 8.5 mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Unkown</p></td><td  ><p>Porcelain, Rose Quartz, Hazel, Obsidian</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The Pixel 10 Pro is expected to feature the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/is-googles-switch-from-samsung-foundry-to-tsmc-for-the-tensor-g5-chip-a-big-deal">Tensor G5</a> SoC, which is rumored to be a significant development as it may be the first SoC designed in-house by Google. Past Tensor chips have used Samsung's Exynos designs, which is why they have never been able to really compete with Qualcomm's offerings. All that should change with the Pixel 10 Pro.</p><p>We should also expect a slight boost in battery capacity to 4,870mAh and a quicker wired charging speed of 29W. It's not much compared to what the competition offers, but it's a step in the right direction for Pixels. The cameras, on the other hand, are expected to remain largely unchanged. We'll likely have new features, but don't expect any significant changes to the sensors.</p><p>The Pixel 9 Pro doesn't perform well in heavy gaming, as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> chip throttles quite noticeably. It's more efficient than the G3, but not a lot more powerful as far as raw performance goes. The cameras on the Pixel 9 Pro are fantastic and can deliver superb details and colors in pretty much all lighting conditions.</p><p>The haptics were something that really stood out, too, when we reviewed it. Battery life is also greatly improved over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a> thanks to the more power-efficient SoC and optimized software.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-pro-vs-pixel-9-pro-software-2">Google Pixel 10 Pro vs. Pixel 9 Pro: Software</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9jrG4Az3RqBSHzPm9Kex9X" name="Android 16" alt="Android 16 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9jrG4Az3RqBSHzPm9Kex9X.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Pixel 10 Pro will most definitely ship with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> as Google has already rolled out the stable release for the Pixel 9 series. Along with this, you can expect seven years of software updates, which would include OS upgrades and security patches. The Pixel 10 Pro could potentially get two more Android versions than the Pixel 9 Pro since the latter launched with Android 14 instead of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> or 16.</p><p>With the Pixel 9 Pro, we saw it get exclusive AI features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-add-me-google-pixel-9">Add Me</a> and Video Boost, and we're sure there are some exclusive features in the works for the Pixel 10 Pro that won't make it to the 9 Pro. These exclusive features are usually bound by the hardware in the phone, which is why they don't make it to previous generation models.

Considering it's rumored to come in at the same price as the Pixel 9 Pro and with pre-order bonuses, the Pixel 10 Pro would be worth getting over the 9 Pro at the same price. Even if only a few of the rumors pan out like the improved performance of the Tensor G5 or the slightly larger battery, it's still a win-win if you're coming from a Pixel 8 Pro or older phone.</p><p>Gaming performance and the low PWM dimming display were our biggest gripes with the Pixel 9 Pro, but if these things don't bother you, you should wait for a price drop on the 9 Pro if you don't want to pay sticker price. The Pixel 9 Pro is still one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> that has a lot going for it and is easier to recommend in 2025 if you can find a good deal.

Specifically, Fitbit said, "We're experiencing a major outage," adding that it began around the time user reports appeared on Reddit this morning.

The list of spec improvements seems mostly rudimentary, like that boring phone "upgrade" you made that doesn't really feel any different from your old one. But then I stumbled upon Viture's Immersive 3D feature, which just debuted on Android a few short weeks ago.</p><p>Immersive 3D is a new software feature from Viture that automatically displays your favorite media in 3D without any kind of official support. You don't even need to convert it before watching! Plug your glasses into an Android phone like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>, launch the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.viture.spacewalker">Spacewalker app</a>, then open YouTube, Hulu, or any photos and video stored on your phone itself, and be greeted with glorious 3D footage that wasn't 3D just a moment before.</p><p>I didn't expect this to work very well at all, considering it's just software-driven and many claims about AI enhancements have been overblown in the past. Apple has something similar on its <em>$3,500 headset</em>, but few want to pay that much for the experience. Meta also has something similar on its much more affordable $299 Quest 3S, but it's only easy to access <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/meta-beats-android-xr-makes-instagram-scrolling-spatial">while scrolling Instagram</a>. Viture offers this Immersive 3D feature on <em>all</em> its glasses, including the <em>very</em> affordable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/VITURE-Glasses-Supported-Consoles-Adjustments/dp/B0CS2VZP6B/"><strong>$199 Viture Lite</strong></a>, with a single app install.</p><h2 id="3d-is-in-vogue-again-2">3D is in vogue again</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qnfz4npQSrri3jiUQtJmL3" name="viture-spacewalker-3d-photos" alt="A mockup provided by Viture showing what Immersive 3D photos look like in its Spacewalker app on Viture smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qnfz4npQSrri3jiUQtJmL3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Viture)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With the increasing popularity of smart glasses, people have seemingly rediscovered 3D content again. The obvious issue is that, outside of a few videos and movies that were made over a decade ago when manufacturers were pushing 3D TVs, there's not a ton of native 3D content. There's not even a good way to just play games in 3D, even though that should be a relatively simple task in an era where millions of VR headsets are used every day.</p><p>That's where Immersive 3D comes in. It uses AI to calculate the depth of a 2D source, be it a video, photo, or even a game, although gaming is currently only available for very powerful gaming PCs at the moment. To get a sample of what gaming would feel like, I fired up a full playthrough of Hogwarts Legacy on YouTube and was blown away by the definition and detail I saw through Viture.</p><p>On Android and iOS, Immersive 3D is just another button to press in the Spacewalker app. On a PC or Mac, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://academy.viture.com/xr_glasses/immersive_3d_windows">it's a separate app</a> to install and run. In my experience so far, it's much easier to use the feature on a PC or Mac since <em>everything</em> is converted to 3D, whereas you have to load up specific sources through the Spacewalker app on Android or iOS.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="j2gHHxyUTBJw2oib5DyBCd" name="viture-Spacewalker-launch-youtube" alt="How to use Spacewalker's Immersive 3D mode on Android" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/j2gHHxyUTBJw2oib5DyBCd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Viture)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The bright side of having a dedicated app is that it's much easier to use. Running Immersive 3D on a PC or Mac is simpler and appears to "just work" after launch. I've been using a special pre-release version of Immersive 3D that works very well on Snapdragon X Elite PCs, but Viture says that gamers who want to use this should be using <em>at least</em> a GeForce RTX 4070, something I don't have access to.</p><p>Immersive 3D was released on Android only a month prior to me writing this, and the experience needs a little bit of work before it feels more natural to use. Spacewalker is a decent app and better than what's provided by other smart glasses companies, but that doesn't mean it's a <em>great</em> experience.</p><p>My biggest beef with it is that it doesn't support all apps on your phone; only a handful that Viture has ensured work through its built-in Firefox-based web browser. That's actually an Android security feature, not something Viture can easily bypass without you having root access to your phone. On Windows and Mac, it just works differently.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eLTeWHPNifphmR7uj43WDd" name="viture-spacewalker-immersive-3d" alt="How to use Spacewalker's Immersive 3D mode on Android" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eLTeWHPNifphmR7uj43WDd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Viture)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That also means services like Netflix won't work because there's no proper DRM translation through that web browser. Netflix works on the iOS version of Spacewalker with Immersive 3D, and Viture tells me it's working on compatibility for Android. At the very least, it's a reminder that this is still the early days of smart glasses technology, and the software needs further maturation.</p><p>After selecting one of the available services, or a local video or photo, a new hovering button will appear in the bottom-right corner of the screen to launch Immersive 3D. Tap that, and the UI on your phone will change slightly, displaying the video's timeline at the bottom, along with a settings button that allows you to choose between three different 3D settings to optimize your experience.</p><p>Viture maintains a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLosIlwOqL2KaartnAjhY15FD8nlAS3xBI">short YouTube playlist</a> and provides <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SPN74tAM8aStTQIG6iHuFKl4Ys9i5VXw">a handful of example photos</a> that you can use to test out the automated 3D translation feature, all of which look <em>very</em> good.</p><h2 id="still-early-days-2">Still early days</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LVRbqfyiypX7eUnwDSXipn" name="viture-luma-pro-connected-to-spacewalker-app-on-oneplus-13" alt="A pair of Viture Luma Pro glasses connected to the Spacewalker app running on a OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LVRbqfyiypX7eUnwDSXipn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It feels like I'm a broken record when I say "it's still early days," because I said this about VR gaming for the first several years until those titles hit their stride somewhere around 2020. The same mantra goes for XR hardware in general, including VR headsets and smart glasses, and I'm not sure the software side of the equation will be fully solved for smart glasses until <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a> starts shipping on them.</p><p>Now, the current Spacewalker process isn't terrible by any means, even if it is limited, but I've found it to be somewhat unreliable and just generally kind of clunky feeling. Several times while surfing through different YouTube videos, the Immersive 3D button would disappear. I usually had to completely shut down Spacewalker and reopen it to get the button back.</p><p>I've also found that it's finicky on some phones, but this isn't always Viture's fault. The app regularly crashed for me on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, while it ran on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review">Honor Magic V3</a> just fine. This is a fresh install on all these phones, so I know it's not some weird cache issue with an older version of the app.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="AQFNx4MzaoLhVZeiiGMaC4" name="viture-luma-pro-side-logo" alt="A pair of Viture Luma Pro glasses connected to the Spacewalker app running on a OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AQFNx4MzaoLhVZeiiGMaC4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>My hope is that Viture can get Spacewalker and/or Immersive 3D upgraded to support <em>all</em> Android apps, not just a very small, select few. This type of compatibility is exactly why Google is developing an entire operating system revolving around XR devices rather than just using an app, the way the company did in the Google Daydream days. I don't think this is possible because of OS-level security, though, and may require separate hardware or an Android XR app to make it happen.</p><p>For now, though, this is a really cool way to reexperience 3D content all over again, even if you don't opt to pay $499 for the latest Viture glasses. It'll be particularly interesting to see how well Immersive 3D holds up once Viture launches its official 3DoF/6DoF capabilities on the Viture Luma line of glasses, as a shifting perspective may not hold up as well with this 3D effect as the current pinned-in-place image does.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="7c89492e-d16b-4c1a-ab72-e8dc7e95d04d">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:84.53%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FmK6AgpbTA8sbEbjDYSNNd.jpg' alt="An official product render of Viture Luma Pro"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Viture Luma Pro</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Viture Luma Pro are the best pair of smart glasses the company has ever made, featuring 1200p micro-OLED displays for each eye, a new adjustable frame design, IPD adjustment, and support for all of Viture's massive ecosystem of XR products.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

Why would Samsung re-release a last-gen foldable? Since Motorola has been doing so well lately, it would seem that the Korean smartphone maker is trying to compete with the Razr and Razr Plus models. Motorola usually relaunches last year's Plus model as the new basic Razr, while the Plus model is the most improved new foldable. This has been a very successful strategy for the brand, and it seems like Samsung is trying to replicate that with the Flip 7 FE and Flip 7.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JQDxg5MBEMXrw5oXVY9aFd" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-all-colors-04.jpg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JQDxg5MBEMXrw5oXVY9aFd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are three main differences between the Flip 6 and its revamped Flip 7 FE re-release. To start with, the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE is much cheaper than the Flip 6. You can currently get the brand new Flip 7 FE with 256GB of storage for $900, however, your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/what-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-fe-color-should-you-buy">color choices are limited to Black and White</a>.

Both variants come with 8GB of RAM.</p><p>On the other hand, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 was priced at $1,100 at launch for the base 256GB/12GB model. With the launch of the new Flip 7 series, you can easily score heavy discounts on the last-gen device, bringing the price down to $900 for the basic variant.</p><p>Memory and price aside, the third most notable difference between the Flip 7 FE and Flip 6 is the processor. The newer Flip 7 FE boasts a slower Exynos 2400 chipset, whereas the older Flip 6 has a superior Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 SoC.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="d78d3b6d-9115-4e20-a38d-c402614b575a">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RJwtppW9DAGqVEQUiZRVhP.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>It's not all that new</strong></em></p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE is the same as the Flip 6, so it can fit in the old-gen Flip's cases like a glove.

The Flip 7 FE is essentially an identical twin to the last-gen Galaxy Z Flip 6, but it's cheaper. The price cut comes with a less powerful Exynos processor.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-color-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-should-you-buy">Flip 6 came in a multitude of colors</a>, ranging from punchy yellows to more sombre shades like black and white. The Flip 7 FE, however, has a much more disappointing number of colorways to offer. Let's take a good look at the options to help you decide which one you like the most.</p><h2 id="what-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-fe-color-should-you-buy-2">What Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE color should you buy?</h2>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_hero" data-id="daf04d2f-b14d-4e04-91a3-ebc2349f943b">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FbHhKFZhdrMpQBn9V5dZhP.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE - Black</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>All-black number</strong></em></p><p>You can't go wrong with a little black Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE.

I don't even know if we can call them colors because black and white feel devoid of it. Still, these are the only two options available for this foldable so you'll have to pick either one if you're dead set on getting the Flip 7 FE. Personally, I'd rather get the last-gen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Flip 6</a> with a more powerful processor and more diverse color options.</p><p>That being said, I find the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE in Black looks much nicer than the White variant. Not only is it a low-maintenance shade that doesn't get as dirty, but it's also better at visibly minimizing the darkened bezels of the Flip 7 FE's cover screen. White clashes horribly with the fat black borders, enhancing the smallness of the display.</p><p>It's the same with the internal folding screen. Since the Flip 7 FE has the same old inner screen as the Flip 6, the bezels are just as noticeably big. Black bezels and a black frame make it appear as if the bezels are smaller, so you should think twice before placing your order for the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE in White.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Was it a ball or a strike? How fast was the pitch? Did it break over the plate, and if so, where?</p><p>Then imagine an equally large spreadsheet from the batter's perspective. Did the ball cross the plate in the strike zone, and if so, where? How fast was it? How did the pitch break? Most importantly, did the batter connect with the pitch, and if so, where and how did the ball fly?</p><p>That's an insane amount of information. A perfectly pitched game still has 81 individual pitches, and you'll never see one. With hundreds of pitches and hundreds of games every year, the sheer amount of data is impossible for a person to analyze in real time.</p><p>That's what AI does best, though. Provide the right data for AI to look at, and it can tell you anything. If you tell AI about every seemingly insignificant stat from every single pitch in every MLB game, it can predict what will happen when presented with the real-time data of the current pitch.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="7LqxohqmsJjLRxM4pqNaUX" name="ask-gemini-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-3" alt="Ask Gemini prompt on Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7LqxohqmsJjLRxM4pqNaUX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Say Joe steps up to the plate for his second at-bat. He's warmed up from playing a few innings, Bob the pitcher has loosened up nicely but hasn't blown out his arm yet, and Bob throws a beautiful breaking pitch to start the inning.</p><p>It crosses the plate just above Baseball Joe's knees at 87 mph, and Joe is ready for it. He swings in a low arc and smashes it! All the data from what happens when Bob throws that pitch at that speed across the plate at that spot is there for AI to analyze.</p><p>AI also has data telling it what happens when Joe hits a pitch at that spot and at that speed. Using this historical data, a projected path can be built. Compare that with real-time data collected by the drones and sensors to compensate for things like humidity, and AI has a very good idea of where that ball will land. It will tell us as it's happening, and we love it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4030px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="sWYNyURt2PjsWsE7DxmVHB" name="Google-ai-server.jpg" alt="Google Tensor server backdrop on stage at Google I/O 2023" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sWYNyURt2PjsWsE7DxmVHB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4030" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You can expand those basics into everything, and it works mostly the same way. For example, you have historical data saved on your phone or in an online account profile. You have real-time data being gathered by your phone or your watch. AI uses the two to "create" an answer for almost any relevant question.</p><p>It can tell you if the sunset will be nice tonight at the beach. It can pair the latest photo you took with a past photo of the same subject for a nice collage. It can predict traffic patterns. It can even estimate when a piece of machinery will need servicing on an assembly line. The functional and useful information it provides uses the same types of patterns as predicting a home run at the All-Star game.</p><p>This is also why AI needs to be fast to be more useful. Telling us where a baseball landed isn't as useful as telling us where it will land, for example.

Predicting that Kyle Schwarber's last swing would fly into the seats to break the tie is a lot easier for a computer algorithm to figure out, and what AI was originally designed to do.</p><p>It's really good at it!</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="1902e49f-11ee-4e70-8edb-acecb4d8c9b9">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tnQGJNQVqF2XVQV4KfMbN8.jpg' alt="google pixel 9 square render"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                    <span class='featured__label horizontal__label'>The best AI phone</span>                                                            <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 9</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>AI powerhouse</strong></em></p><p>The Pixel 9 has a premium build, excellent cameras, and better connectivity than its predecessors.

The original poster (OP), VHBlazer, states they received a $96 off discount for the NFL Sunday Ticket as a returning subscriber. The user states they typically subscribe and then kick it after March Madness.</p><p>This was reported earlier this week, and it seems it's still rolling out. Of course, there's likely some underlying conditions there.</p><p>While others have started receiving their emails, they report an interesting occurrence: the price discount is <em>not </em>always the same. A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubetv/comments/1m0p9vo/comment/n3bwia2/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">few users who've been emailed</a> by YouTube TV in hopes of returning claim they've been offered $48 off, instead of $96. It's not exactly clear why there's this gap in discounts.</p><p>On the other hand, some users say they haven't received a "returning user" email, but attempting to return manually shows a discounted price. Some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubetv/comments/1m0p9vo/comment/n3ccf53/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">even report getting the email</a>, yet trying to purchase still shows the full price undiscounted price. Perhaps contacting YouTube TV's support would be beneficial here.</p><h2 id="the-nfl-25-26-season-is-upon-us-2">The NFL '25-'26 Season is upon us</h2><blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubetv/comments/1m0p9vo/nfl_sunday_ticket_returning_subscriber_deal_96_off">NFL Sunday Ticket returning subscriber deal: $96 off</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubetv">r/youtubetv</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><p>Back in June, YouTube TV <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv/huge-youtube-tv-deals-nfl-sunday-ticket-games-2025-season-report">announced some major discounts</a> for new NFL Sunday Ticket holders interested in watching their first season. New consumers purchasing the Season Pass on YouTube can do so for $276, while those on YouTube's Primetime Channels will see it for $318.</p><p>It's worth mentioning that the previous announcement didn't concern recurring or returning NFL Sunday Ticket holders at all. Those users would still see the same full-priced packages. Now, though, with the recent Reddit reports, perhaps YouTube TV is offering a little love to its older, unsubscribed crowd.</p><p>Also, YouTube TV's monthly payment option for the NFL season is rolling out in more States for more users. This should give users a little more flexibility with the NFL Sunday Ticket moving forward. Be warned: YouTube TV states Season Pass' monthly installment plan length will change from 12 months to eight as we near the beginning of the season in September.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It's a short questionnaire, so the AI knows everything about you and your pet before calling.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1068px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.18%;"><img id="vQuJoB46hgMcCxuDrrp7yb" name="google-search-have-ai-check-pricing" alt="Google Search is receiving a "Have AI check for pricing" button, which lets it call businesses on your behalf for info." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vQuJoB46hgMcCxuDrrp7yb.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1068" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1070px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.07%;"><img id="GzHR6QLqsnDG2MhASyPxzb" name="google-search-ai-calling-update-request-email" alt="Google Search's AI, after calling businesses, will compile its information into an update email for the user, per their request." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GzHR6QLqsnDG2MhASyPxzb.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1070" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>It will question you about your pet's breed, weight, what service you're looking for, when you'd like to visit, and your contact information.

This Pro model advances what AI Mode can already do with better reasoning capabilities for math and code-related questions. What's more, AI Mode's Gemini 2.5 Pro integration brings Google's "Deep Search" ability.</p><p>Google says this option, when asking a question, can help "save hours by issuing hundreds of searches, reasoning across disparate pieces of information and crafting a comprehensive, fully-cited report in minutes." In short, Deep Search dives in deep, digging up every bit of information for you on a particular subject and compiling it neatly.</p><p>This is for users who want every piece of information <em>before </em>making an important decision. Since the advanced reasoning and Deep Search are brought to you by Gemini 2.5 Pro, Google says the toggle for it in AI Mode is only available for subscribers. Those with AI Pro or AI Ultra can click "AI Mode" and swap to the 2.5 Pro option for these advanced features if you've enrolled in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://labs.google.com/search/experiment/22">Search Labs</a> experiment.</p><h2 id="ai-mode-levels-up-again-2">AI Mode levels up (again)</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WPwBbvkCNKuxLfmwvPoxZf" name="Shopping-AI-Mode-checkout" alt="Shopping on AI Mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WPwBbvkCNKuxLfmwvPoxZf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In May, during I/O 2025, AI Mode <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/ai-mode-levels-up-with-new-ai-features-stealing-google-searchs-spotlight">completely stole Google Search's thunder</a> when the company announced Gemini integration. The feature was being granted Gemini 2.5, the predecessor to what the feature is starting to receive today. The model was added to AI Overviews, as well, bringing the intelligence it needed to handle complex queries. This was a custom version of the model that arrived, making it more "ideal" for whatever topic the user was curious about.</p><p>Even shopping with AI Mode was boosted. Users could detail what they're looking for, and the AI's "Shopping Graph" will "browse for inspiration, think through considerations, and narrow down products."</p><p>Google Search itself received a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/project-astra-joins-gemini-arm-as-google-gears-up-for-public-launch">Project Astra</a> update, letting users speak to Gemini as it looks at the world through your camera.

While they haven't mentioned their source, the spec sheet seems quite thorough.</p><p>To start, the publication notes that the phone's cover display could be a bit larger than the previous model, measuring 6.4 inches. This could be due to the rumored reduction of the cover display’s bezel and the potential reworking of the hinge.  Additionally, the leak suggests that the cover display is also getting a brightness upgrade of up to 3,000 nits of peak brightness, a 10% increase from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-fold-changed-my-mind-about-foldables-but-i-still-prefer-flip-phones">Pixel 9 Pro Fold.</a></p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1412px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="hvewYswQphNguzfjxft4Qg" name="google-pixel-10-pro-fold-leaked-render-closed" alt="A leaked rendering of the alleged Pixel 10 Pro Fold in a Porcelain color." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hvewYswQphNguzfjxft4Qg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1412" height="794" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Speaking about the device's battery, the leak suggests that it will show up with the largest non-silicon carbon battery, with 5,015mAh capacity and a bump from the 4,460mAh of the previous model. Which means users with this new foldable could use it for a couple more hours than the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. The massive battery will supposedly get a 23W wired, 15W wireless (with Qi2) charging compatibility.</p><p>As many previous rumors have indicated, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold might be powered by the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/is-googles-switch-from-samsung-foundry-to-tsmc-for-the-tensor-g5-chip-a-big-deal">Tensor G5</a> 3nm chipset. However, things remain unchanged when it comes to the phone's camera. According to the website, the phone will sport a 48-megapixel primary camera, a 10.5-megapixel ultrawide, and a 10.8-megapixel 5x telephoto camera. It will also have 10-megapixel selfie cameras on the cover as well as the main display.</p><p>As for the device's storage, the phone might see a higher 1TB option of this foldable, as indicated by a previous leak as well. And these storage options could also be linked to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/new-pixel-10-colors-have-been-leaked-bringing-some-unexpected-storage-treats">color users choose for their device.</a></p><p>Lastly, Android Headlines claims that the Pixel 10 Pro Fold will be the first ever foldable to get an IP68 dust and water rating, which is much higher than the Samsung Z Fold 7's rating as well.</p><p>That said, as real as this may seem, this is still just a leak and must be taken with a grain of salt. However, the wait isn't for that long as Google officially announced that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-officially-sets-a-date-for-its-pixel-10-launch-event">Pixel 10 series would be unveiled on Aug. 20 in New York.</a></p> ]]></dc:content>
