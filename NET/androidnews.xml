The Sony WH-1000XM6 headphones just launched, and the older WH-1000XM5 model is actually <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/buying-the-sony-wh-1000xm6-during-prime-day-is-a-bad-move-get-these-sony-headphones-instead">the better Amazon Prime Day deal</a>. But if you love Sony audio products, the best Prime Day deal slashes $102 off the Sony WF-1000XM5 earbuds. I review headphones and earbuds for a living, and at their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WF-1000XM5-Bluetooth-Canceling-Headphones/dp/B0C33XXS56/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">Prime Day deal price of just $198</a> the Sony WF-1000XM5's are a steal.</p><p>With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sony-wf-1000xm5-review">WF-1000XM5 earbuds</a>, Sony scaled down its insanely-good audio quality and ANC into a compact form factor. They're 25% smaller and 20% lighter than the older model, for instance. They're smaller in size, but not in features ‚Äî these earbuds have three microphones per side, and two processors that individually handle sound and active noise-canceling.</p><p>If you need <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">a pair of stellar wireless earbuds</a> with ANC, the Sony WF-1000XM5 can go toe-to-toe with the best from Apple, Bose, and others. Only now, this Prime Day deal makes them much more affordable, and it won't last long.</p><ul><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fprimeday%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-7115265592038255063-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>Prime Day ends tomorrow!

You get fantastic EQ and customization options in the Sony Headphones Connect app. You also have unique audio modes like Sony's 360 Reality Audio and an ear tip fit test to make sure they fit just right in your ears.</p><p>Sony also has standout support for Bluetooth audio codecs, which audiophiles will love to hear. SBC, AAC, LDAC, and LC3 are all available on the Sony WF-1000XM5 earbuds. Specifically, LDAC is a proprietary Sony codec that can handle 24-bit/96kHz sample rates at a bitrate of up to 990kbps. In layman's terms, the Sony WF-1000XM5 could quite literally sound better than any other pair of wireless earbuds on the market.</p><p>Whether you're looking to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/from-usd19-earbuds-to-flagship-phones-heres-the-prime-day-travel-tech-id-actually-buy">shore up your travel gear during Prime Day</a> or just need an audio refresh, the Sony WF-1000XM5 are such an underrated buy this time of year.

But even at less than two years old, the battery is already starting to wane, and there's no easy way to attach a battery to them without looking like a lunatic.</p><p>But I'm willing to try anything, especially with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide">Amazon Prime Day</a> making people's gimmicky Ray-Ban mods more affordable.

But that front clip-on and cable tether will stand out, like a strip of tape on a movie nerd's broken glasses, so it's best suited for (say) a long nature walk where you don't care as much about style.</p><p><strong>‚úÖRecommended if: </strong>You want to extend your Ray-Ban Meta battery life, don't mind carrying the charging case around with you, and have a darker pair on which the cable won't stand out too much.</p><p><strong>‚ùåSkip this deal if: </strong>You'd rather buy the version that drains your phone battery, or you'd rather let your glasses die then make them look too dorky with a cable attached.</p><p>I obviously can't tell you if this mod will work without having tried it myself, nor if the cable is long enough to keep the charging case in your pocket as you walk. But I appreciate this unique and clever approach to solving the battery problem with my glasses, and I'm hopeful it'll solve my problems.</p><p>Eventually, I'm going to look into Meta Oakley glasses, which have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oakley-meta-hstn-glasses-vs-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses">doubled battery life over the Ray-Ban Metas</a>, or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/this-could-be-our-first-look-at-the-next-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses">leaked 3rd-generation Ray-Ban Metas</a> that are supposed to have "significantly longer battery life" than my current pair.

According to this executive, the company is looking at launching its next tablets, the Galaxy Tab S11 series, "shortly." The unnamed source didn't give specifics; however, they state the tablets will see a launch timeframe close to Samsung's "traditional cadence."</p><p>The publication's source stating the launch adheres to Samsung's "traditional" cadence seems a little strange. It sounds like they're referring to its launch timeframe but, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/the-samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-series-is-here-but-one-major-thing-is-missing">other than the Galaxy Tab S10</a>, its recent tablets have launched earlier in the year.</p><p>The last series debuted in September (Sept. 26 to be specific), which was a one month shift from the Galaxy Tab S9 and seven month difference for the S8 series. The latter debuted in February 2022, while the former appeared in August 2023.</p><p>The publication speculates we should see the Tab S11 in September again this year, which sounds more plausible, unless Samsung stuns us with an August reveal.</p><h2 id="the-tab-s11-could-switch-up-the-series-again-2">The Tab S11 could switch up the series (again)</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.65%;"><img id="NfrsoLNyaA2tqoScU3h5GX" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-empty-home-screen.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra - Empty Home Screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NfrsoLNyaA2tqoScU3h5GX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1333" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Galaxy Tab S11 rumor trail goes back a few months, but its most recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/galaxy-tab-s11-ultra-surfaces-stronger-mediatek-database-leaks">leak claims the Ultra model</a> will debut with a powered-up chip. The Tab S11 Ultra was reportedly spotted running through Geekbench for its performance test; however, it was listed with a MediaTek chip: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek/mediatek-dimensity-9400-plus-soc-launch">Dimensity 9400 Plus SoC</a>. This is MediaTek's refreshed response to Qualcomm's flagship, the Snapdragon 8 Elite.</p><p>Strangely, reports said the tablet scored "lower than smartphones" despite rocking this flagship chip. The SoC features a strong GPU that helps facilitate "PC-like" graphical performance on mobile devices.</p><p>Also, with the Tab S11 series (hopefully) coming up, rumors have stated Samsung is switching things up by returning the base model <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/samsung-galaxy-tab-s11-s10-lite-device-rumors">and dropping the Plus</a>. We were <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/hey-samsung-wheres-the-galaxy-tab-s10">already looking around</a> for the base Galaxy Tab S10 after Samsung only gave us a Plus and Ultra. Now, we're just confused. Regardless, Tab S11 is rumored to feature a 8,160mAh battery, while the Ultra could jump to  ~11,374mAh this year.</p><p>Earlier rumors suggested Samsung would save the Tab S11 series for a launch after Unpacked, meaning sometime in the fall. So, perhaps its debut will mirror the Tab S10 after all.</p><ul><li><strong>Tablet deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/ipad-tablets-ereaders/tablets/pcmcat209000050008.c?id=pcmcat209000050008"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/search?q=tablet"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/tablets-laptops-computers-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=tablet&crid=2HCFROTF588S1&sprefix=tablet%2Caps%2C159&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/search/tablet"><u><strong>Dell</strong></u></a><strong></strong></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

In an accompanying <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/16126339?hl=en&ref_topic=16079905&sjid=14845917384801852633-NA&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&oco=1">support page</a>,  Google says users can then add a text description into the box, informing the AI of <em>how </em>they want the video to be generated.</p><p>The post states users should be as descriptive as possible, detailing the scene and "any audio instructions" to Gemini. After finishing, users should navigate beneath the text box to <strong>More > Veo > Submit.</strong></p><p>These clips won't be full-length YouTube-esque videos, mind you.

Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers "globally" can expect the feature to start appearing today (July 10) in Gemini. What's more, the post says users can expect these same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-introduces-new-ai-tools-to-help-creatives-direct-like-a-pro">photo-to-video capabilities in Flow</a>, too.</p><p>Google also highlights its commitment to safety with its AI tools, stating that it's taken "significant steps" to ensure an "appropriate experience."</p><p>What's funny about this "new" feature rolling out in Gemini today is that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-400-series-to-debut-google-cloud-powered-ai-image-to-video-feature">we've seen before</a>. In May, Google launched five second clip generation capabilities using its Google Cloud AI-powered software for the Honor 400 series. The feature works the same way as what you'll find in Gemini, turning regular photos into animated clips. What key difference was the launch on Honor's 400 series came with the Veo 2 model, and later required a Google subscription for continued use.</p><p>Veo 3 was shining <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-veo-3-youtube-shorts-integration-creator-creativity-report">highlight during I/O 2025</a>, as Google detailed its audio capabilities and lifelike video strength.

However, I'm not really a fan of using a mouse and keyboard, as a good controller goes a long way. For the better part of the past year, there's been one controller on my desk, and it's currently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Controller-PC-Rubberized-Lighting-Charging/dp/B0DPMGDZLZhttps://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Controller-PC-Rubberized-Lighting-Charging/dp/B0DPMGDZLZ"><strong>$20 off</strong></a><strong> </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Controller-PC-Rubberized-Lighting-Charging/dp/B0DPMGDZLZ"><strong>for Prime Day</strong></a>.</p><p>Obviously, we're not strangers to GameSir, but until I got the Super Nova, I never really considered them for anything other than <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-game-controllers-android">mobile gaming</a>. At the time, I was using my Xbox Elite Series 2 Core, but the rubber grips had started to wear off, and something was going on with the left joystick.</p><p>But I've always been a sucker for Xbox controllers, so I figured I would end up just buying another one to replace it. Almost a year later, and that has not happened, with the Super Nova still being docked right on my desk.</p><ul><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fprimeday%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1316556028087985621-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>Prime Day is LIVE: See the full list of Amazon deals</strong></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="223d9e37-812a-4eff-b505-c0aada28922a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="GameSir Super Nova:" data-dimension48="GameSir Super Nova:" href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Controller-PC-Rubberized-Lighting-Charging/dp/B0DPMGDZLZ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="8rC5NWQMzPfroLRfjkJfh4" name="gamesir-super-nova-square-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8rC5NWQMzPfroLRfjkJfh4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>GameSir Super Nova:</strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0DCLD9PLY%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1329189071882698668-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored" data-dimension112="223d9e37-812a-4eff-b505-c0aada28922a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="GameSir Super Nova:" data-dimension48="GameSir Super Nova:" data-dimension25=""> </a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Controller-PC-Rubberized-Lighting-Charging/dp/B0DPMGDZLZ" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><del>$59.99</del> <strong>$39.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>There are a lot of controllers out there, even from GameSir itself, but the Super Nova remains my favorite of the bunch.

It probably won't take long to realize why I might like this, since it's basically the same design as Microsoft's controller, down to the rubberized grips.</p><p>The controls are all nice and responsive, and I don't even feel the need to install GameSir's Nexus app on my PC. Part of that is because I'm pretty basic and don't really use things like the paddle controls on the back. What I do use, however, are the trigger switches. This shortens the travel distance before the input is recognized, and is an absolute necessity when I'm playing Call of Duty.</p><p>And on top of all of that, I never have to worry about plugging in or replacing batteries, as the Super Nova comes with a charging dock. So when I'm done playing, I just put it back on the dock until the next gaming session rolls around.</p><h2 id="prime-day-2025-android-deals-quick-links-12">Prime Day 2025 Android deals ‚Äî quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-9764014712696558246-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>Prime Day is LIVE July 8-11: see the full list of Amazon deals</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phones:¬†</strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Fref_%3Dnav_cs_gb%26bubble-id%3Dcell-phones-accessories%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-6188859583910098122-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">major discounts on Samsung and Pixel</a></li><li><strong>Tablets:¬†</strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dtablets%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-3325142520077420800-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">discounted Galaxy Tab and iPad</a></li><li><strong>Wearables:¬†</strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dsmartwatches%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-4166824583098299148-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">up to 45% off Garmin watches</a></li><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Famazonprime%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1424464865141903563-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>Most Prime Day deals are members-only: sign up for the 30-day trial</strong></a></li></ul><ul><li><em>For more on Prime Day 2025, check out¬†</em><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><em><strong>our ultimate shopping guide</strong></em></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The company highlights this channel as an "experimental new option for developers" interested in getting early glimpses at in-development Android features and APIs. This first release is rolling out for Pixel owners ranging from the Pixel 6 series up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">to the Pixel 9</a>, including the Pixel Fold and Tablet.</p><p>Developers with an eligible Pixel phone can begin downloading the ZP11.250606.010.A1  build to test the latest Android version contents.</p><p>However, even though this is for developers, Google stresses that these early Android API builds are deep in their testing era. Builds, such as the first one via the Canary Release Channel today, "may contain bugs or issues that could affect your device's normal operations." These builds aren't "suitable for everyday use," so developers might want to have another device on standby as their daily driver.</p><p>In a separate newsletter, obtained by Android Central's News Editor, Nandika Ravi, developers can help "build for new foldables and wearables." The letter highlights the ability to help build new adaptive apps for phones <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/biggest-announcements-from-samsungs-summer-unpacked-galaxy-z-fold-7-flip-7-and-more">like the Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Fold 7</a> for more "immersive experiences" that "adaptively" respond to these unique devices. Moreover, developers can also get their hands on the tools required to build new, refreshing features in Wear OS 6.</p><h2 id="android-s-soaring-with-canary-2">Android's soaring with Canary</h2><blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1lwjvwh/introducing_the_android_canary_release_channel">Introducing the Android Canary Release Channel!</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta">r/android_beta</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><p>The Reddit post states developers can flash the latest Canary build onto their Android device or they can use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/about/canary#on_emulatoroper.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds">Android Emulator</a> via Android Studio. Once it's installed, your device becomes eligible for future Canary patches and updates. These are expected to occur "once a month." Be warned: if you're looking to leave the Android Canary channel, your device will have to undergo a full data wipe.</p><p>If the name "Canary" sounds familiar, it's because of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/chrome/canary/">Google's Chrome Canary</a> test environment for users and developers. Anyone can download Chrome Canary to try out the latest advancements, features, and more headed for Chrome before anyone else (using Stable) see it. Google sees it as a way to squash terrible bugs <em>before </em>they become an issue.</p><p>One key difference is that Chrome Canary <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/chrome-release-channels">is updated far more frequently</a> than Google's plans for Android Canary. According to its dev doc, Chrome Canary is updated once a day and, at times, multiple times a day. Of course, some of these more frequent updates in a single day is because Canary "can (and does) break," per Google.</p><p>The company's been busy testing a wide range of Chrome features, ranging from AI to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chrome-ai-password-data-breach-help-spotted">protect users from data breaches</a> to better enhancements from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chrome-ai-scam-detection-canary-flag">phishing attempts/scams</a>.</p><p>It's also been a little over two weeks since Google released <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-qpr1-beta-2-1-starts-rolling-out-to-pixels-with-some-bug-fixes">Android 16 QPR1 Beta 2.1</a> to Pixel testers. The minor patch was filled with a few fixes that were plaguing devices following the more substantial 2.0 update. Users on Reddit are awaiting the 3.0 update, as are we.</p> ]]></dc:content>

If you‚Äôve got a good memory, this isn‚Äôt totally out of the blue: back in 2022, Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-sets-the-new-standard-with-four-generations-of-os-upgrades-to-ensure-the-most-up-to-date-and-more-secure-galaxy-experience" target="_blank">promised</a> up to four years of One UI Watch and Wear OS updates for the Watch 4 lineup.</p><p>However, when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/one-ui-8-beta-3-rolls-out-for-galaxy-s25-and-galaxy-watches-see-their-first-beta">Samsung dropped the One UI 8 Watch beta</a>, it kind of looked like the Galaxy Watch 4 was being quietly pushed aside. A footnote in the beta release mentioned it was only for the Galaxy Watch 5 or newer, leaving many of us scratching our heads.</p><h2 id="beta-confusion-cleared-up-2">Beta confusion cleared up</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6QcGwVWwAKAMkRPWHY4eCB" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-4-lifestyle.jpg" alt="The Galaxy Watch 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6QcGwVWwAKAMkRPWHY4eCB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Chris Wedel / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Just when most of us had written off the Watch 4 as yesterday‚Äôs news, Samsung obviously had other plans. After some confusion and plenty of speculation online, the company has now officially confirmed that the Galaxy Watch 4 lineup is getting the same fresh coat of software paint that's rolling out to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-smartwatch">newer Galaxy Watches</a>.</p><p>This marks the last major update for these four-year-old watches, which originally rolled out with Wear OS 3 and One UI Watch 3 out of the box.</p><p>One UI 8 Watch packs in a bunch of upgrades you‚Äôd think were just for the newer model, like better health tracking, deeper sleep data, and Galaxy AI tricks that Samsung won‚Äôt stop talking about.</p><p>The Galaxy Watch 4 series is powered by the 4nm Exynos W920 with just two Cortex-A55 cores, so it‚Äôs anyone‚Äôs guess how well One UI 8 Watch will actually run on it. It's highly probable that some of the fancier, newer features destined for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-hands-on">Galaxy Watch 8</a> series might not make it to the older hardware.</p><p>Still, it‚Äôs a nice move for anyone sticking with their Galaxy Watch 4. Instead of being left behind, the watch is getting a refresh and a few upgrades to keep things feeling new again.</p> ]]></dc:content>

For most people, that's more than enough to charge up multiple smartphones, even with the power distribution between each port in use. One USB-C port is perfect for laptops and higher-power devices, while two USB-C ports can simultaneously charge up to a total of 140W (up to 70W per port). Have to charge three devices?

Not only that, but the adjustable wrist strap fits all hand sizes ‚Äî from kids to adults ‚Äî and helps balance the controllers better in your hands.</p><p>That makes them <em>far</em> more comfortable for long play sessions and even helps you better throw objects while playing in VR.

Just pop the door out like usual and snap it back in when you're done!</p><p>But not everyone likes the feel of the smooth plastic of the Meta Quest Touch controllers. That's why Kiwi Design's choice of grips is a great choice. They're a bit more expensive than the minimalist AMVR strap, but the soft-touch silicone material covers your entire Quest controller (with cutouts for the tracking LEDs), preventing hand sweat and adding extra grip in the process.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="5bb63375-666e-407f-a19a-c2ae982a116b" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Kiwi Design upgraded controller grips: $34.99" data-dimension48="Kiwi Design upgraded controller grips: $34.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0DFXW7JTN/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:94.07%;"><img id="vnVrqpbLQVa8ZYYaoCQ3BS" name="meta-quest-3s-kiwi-design-g4-pro-controller-grips-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vnVrqpbLQVa8ZYYaoCQ3BS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1500" height="1411" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Kiwi Design upgraded controller grips: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0DFXW7JTN/" data-dimension112="5bb63375-666e-407f-a19a-c2ae982a116b" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Kiwi Design upgraded controller grips: $34.99" data-dimension48="Kiwi Design upgraded controller grips: $34.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$34.99</del><strong> $27.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>Kiwi Design's upgraded controller grips envelop your controllers in a comfy silicone bumper, preventing slippage and sweat.

I've never personally had an issue with them falling off my face, even while looking down, but nose pads absolutely help keep them from sliding down my nose the rest of the day.</p><ul><li>For more on Prime Day 2025, check out¬†<a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><strong>our ultimate shopping guide</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

During a press interview with Roh, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/business/tech-science/20250710/samsung-seeks-to-roll-out-tri-fold-phone-by-year-end-head-of-smartphone-business-says">The Korea Times</a> highlighted a part of the discussions where the long-rumored "Galaxy G Fold" was brought up. According to Roh, the company "(is expected to) launch the tri-fold phone within this year."</p><p>Roh spoke about those Galaxy G Fold rumors, adding that Samsung has not finalized a name for the tri-fold just yet.</p><p>With this, we can probably expect the phone sometime between now (July) and December. However, Roh's statement might pit the tri-fold closer to a year-end release. The publication cites Roh's estimation in saying the phone might launch "at the end of this year."</p><p>Unfortunately, Roh's press interview didn't yield any other specifications or neat features about the tri-fold. We'll have to wait a little while longer, but there should be some official Samsung teasers when we get close.</p><h2 id="needs-a-little-longer-2">Needs a little longer</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3119px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="AGyKNb3RmavuoSfaBqgTJA" name="samsung-unpacked-android-xr-triple-fold" alt="Samsung Unpacked 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AGyKNb3RmavuoSfaBqgTJA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3119" height="1755" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>During Galaxy Unpacked in January, Samsung teased what consumers can expect from it following the Galaxy S25 series launch. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/did-samsung-just-tell-us-a-tri-fold-phone-is-coming-soon">in its "roadmap,"</a> there was a unique device: a tri-fold. While a surprise, Samsung has shown off its tri-fold device prototypes a few times, especially during the CES 2025 event. The company opted to focus more on its Android XR device, instead, perhaps hinting that the phone wasn't anywhere near completion.</p><p>Shortly after, in February, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-tri-fold-name-change-hardware-specs-rumored">rumors started coming out</a>, stating Samsung was looking at naming the phone the Galaxy G Fold. There's speculation that a new "display and film" could be found on the device's alleged 10-inch display. And it seems it might not top Huawei's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-is-the-most-exciting-phone-around">Mate XT</a> level of thinness.</p><p>More importantly, early rumors claimed Samsung could debut the device anywhere between late 2025 and early 2026. With Roh's recent comments, perhaps it's the former we should keep our eyes on.</p><p>Anyway, Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/biggest-announcements-from-samsungs-summer-unpacked-galaxy-z-fold-7-flip-7-and-more">Unpacked event yesterday</a> (July 9) brought us the Galaxy Z Flip 7, Flip 7 FE, Fold 7, and its latest Galaxy Watch 8 series. The Flip 7 has been upgraded with a more immersive edge-to-edge 4-inch display, while the Fold 7 slims down quite a bit after ditching the S Pen. Even the base Galaxy Watch 8 became a bit thinner, as Samsung packed loads of new health and sleep-focused features into the series.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

You don't need to spend more than $20 to get the highest quality screen protection for your foldable's internal and external displays.</p><p>There are a few names that keep popping up time and time again when it comes to screen protector brands. IMBZBK and Milomdoi in particular always deliver, both in terms of quality and value. The three-pack from IMBZBK is the most comprehensive kit available for the Galaxy Z Flip 7. Getting three sets of three items along with two frames for under $20 is a magnificent bargain. Both easy-install frames enable perfect at-home installation. The lens protectors are an added bonus.</p><p>If you're not comfortable replacing the internal screen protector off of the folding screen, you don't need to step out of your comfort zone. Simply get a cover display protector alone, which will be more cost-effective too. Spigen's upgraded GlastR EZ Fit Pro for the Galaxy Z Flip 7 is a good option. It comes with a frame that also acts as a dust-removing tool, simplifying the installation process. This kit includes two pieces for about $17, but if you want a cheaper alternative, consider the three-pack from Mr.Shield that only costs $7. There's no assistive frame or tool included, however, so take that into consideration before going forward with your purchase.</p><p>After grabbing a solid screen protection kit, be sure to check out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/best-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-cases">best Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 cases</a> for advanced impact absorption.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Despite the naming scheme, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic doesn't really come in a dark color like black, charcoal, or graphite. If that's a deal breaker, perhaps you'll be happier with the regular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8 in Graphite</a> instead ‚Äî sans rotating bezel, though.</p><p>Don't knock the Black variant of the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic until you've seen it up close and personal. I know many people only buy black tech. In fact, my husband is one such individual. However, variety is the spice of life. So spice things up with this silver-and-black combo for once! It looks really cool and matches well with various styles and materials of watch bands.</p><p>If the non-monochrome look bothers you, then the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic in White will fit your tastes. This option is silver throughout and comes with a bright white band.</p><p>I do have a bone to pick with Samsung over the limited case colors. My favorite hue for wearables is usually gold, rose gold, or champagne gold. This is because it's much easier to match such shades with accessories and jewelry. It's a missed opportunity on Samsung's part to skip a warmer colorway for the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic.</p><p>We're stuck with these options for this generation, so there's not much to do but complain. Hopefully, Samsung will heed our grievances with its next smartwatch lineup. If not, then people like me will probably stick with the Google Pixel Watch.</p> ]]></dc:content>

You can grab the unlocked model straight from Samsung‚Äôs online store or try your luck at places like Best Buy or Amazon. Either way, you're looking at paying full price or hopping on Samsung‚Äôs payment plan, neither of which quite hits like those sweet carrier promos.</p><h2 id="some-underdogs-step-up-2">Some underdogs step up</h2><p>Now, before you completely despair, there are a couple of small-time players who are actually offering the device.

It comes with all the expected trimmings of the Flip series, minus a few high-end frills to keep the price down.

Plus, since this is a Chromebook Plus model, you'll get 12 months of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google AI Pro</a> for free. That gives you access to the latest Gemini features, along with 2TB of cloud storage.</p><p>Nevertheless, this is the kind of Chromebook that is good for practically everyone, even if you aren't a fan of the RGB backlighting. Ultimately, you can just make adjustments or turn it off from the Settings app after it lands on your doorstep.</p><h2 id="prime-day-2025-android-deals-quick-links-37">Prime Day 2025 Android deals ‚Äî quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-2399640095952979730-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>Prime Day is LIVE July 8-11: see the full list of Amazon deals</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phones:¬†</strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Fref_%3Dnav_cs_gb%26bubble-id%3Dcell-phones-accessories%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-8227143803950300941-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">major discounts on Samsung and Pixel</a></li><li><strong>Tablets:¬†</strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dtablets%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-4918385691477463048-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">discounted Galaxy Tab and iPad</a></li><li><strong>Wearables:¬†</strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dsmartwatches%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-4130069407617560132-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">up to 45% off Garmin watches</a></li><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Famazonprime%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1479270651470444954-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>Most Prime Day deals are members-only: sign up for the 30-day trial</strong></a></li></ul><ul><li><em>For more on Prime Day 2025, check out¬†</em><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><em><strong>our ultimate shopping guide</strong></em></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

One of Google's reported early Pixel 10 models supposedly appeared on an unexpected website overseas.</p><p>A post by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/07/08/one-of-googles-pixel-10-prototypes-just-leaked-on-a-chinese-auction-site/">9to5Google</a> highlights the apparent appearance of a Pixel 10 prototype model on a Chinese <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.goofish.com/item?spm=a21ybx.item.itemCnxh.26.301a3da6AshFjk&id=934114703133&categoryId=0">auction website</a>. The machine-translated description box says the seller is offering the motherboard of the phone in question, which looks similar to what we've seen in past leaks. The alleged Pixel 10 still sports those rounded corners and flat edges, just like Google's past-gen.</p><p>The back, which furthers its prototype nature, displays the "G" logo and a horizontal camera bump with an extra lens. The photo of the motherboard features a bolded "G5," which likely indicates the phone's expected <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-has-reportedly-finished-designing-the-pixel-10s-custom-tensor-g5-soc">Tensor G5</a> SoC.</p><p>There appear to be three lenses inside the Pixel 10's camera island and its LED flash. The Chinese seller states this device is in its EVT stage, which the publication notes indicates the "final stage" before mass production for the market. However, 9to5 picked up on an oddity, which is the phone's fastboot mode screen that displays DVT (Design Validation Test) instead of the seller's alleged EVT stage.</p><h2 id="an-earlier-pixel-10-2">An Earlier Pixel 10?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:781px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:74.90%;"><img id="PKKNwurqhWzQgVeAp8GWvL" name="google-pixel-10-chinese-auction-site-leak" alt="An alleged Pixel 10 in black on sale on a Chinese auction website." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PKKNwurqhWzQgVeAp8GWvL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="781" height="585" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: GooFish)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The trail of Pixel 10 leaks about its camera upgrade started in March, when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-series-render-leak-reveal-identical-design">a batch of renders</a> showcased it with three, not two. Aside from the seemingly identical design to the Pixel 9, there was speculation that this third lens would bring the base model closer to its Pro and Pro XL siblings. In June, we were met with a report that suggested the Pixel 10 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10s-rumored-telephoto-camera-upgrade-could-make-your-macro-shots-pop">would grab a telephoto lens addition</a>.

Still, we've always called these phones flagship killers, as they feature a really nice balance of affordability and overall performance, and this price point makes the phone even more appealing.

I take a pair of smart glasses on every work trip, and I've been finding myself using RayNeo Air 3S most often because of the comfortable display with 3840Hz PWM dimming and hardware-level blue light blocking.</p><p>Like other smart display glasses, you'll plug the RayNeo Air 3S into basically any computer, console, smartphone, or tablet with a USB-C port and be presented with a giant projected virtual screen that only you can see. This one is a 1080p display, so it looks as crisp as a TV hanging on your wall and helps eliminate neck pain caused by looking down at a laptop or handheld gaming system for too long.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><strong>Prime Day deals and FAQ</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-ca-5457778577287776063-20" target="_blank"><strong>Shop all Amazon Prime Day deals</strong></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="2a269bde-9787-4196-be1e-e338929de117" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Was: $269" data-dimension48="Was: $269" data-dimension25="$" href="https://www.amazon.com/RayNeo-Glasses-HueView-Display-Portable/dp/B0FFSHMQQ4" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1173px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.41%;"><img id="PfQe5DAyAUyKTqGLtwHJCL" name="RayNeo Air 3S" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PfQe5DAyAUyKTqGLtwHJCL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1173" height="779" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>RayNeo Air 3S üòé</strong></p><p><strong>Was: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/RayNeo-Glasses-HueView-Display-Portable/dp/B0FFSHMQQ4" target="_blank" data-dimension112="2a269bde-9787-4196-be1e-e338929de117" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Was: $269" data-dimension48="Was: $269" data-dimension25="$"><del>$269</del></a></p><p><strong>Now:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/RayNeo-Glasses-HueView-Display-Portable/dp/B0FFSHMQQ4" target="_blank"><strong>$225 at Amazon</strong></a><em></em></p><p>"With the Air 3S, RayNeo crafted what may possibly be the best budget XR glasses.

The higher that number goes, the more comfortable it is for your eyes long-term.</p><p>These glasses use a classic "birdbath-style" lens to reflect the micro-OLED display in the glasses toward your eyes. Think of them as tiny mirrors hanging just inside the glasses' frame. Because of the way the optics work, your eyes perceive this display as a huge TV projected a few feet away.</p><p>Folks who need prescription glasses can order a custom pair <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://honsvr.com/product/custom-rayneo-air-2s-prescription-lenses-by-honsvr/">through HonsVR for $50</a>. I use these inserts in my smart glasses to ensure I don't have any eye strain, and they're super easy to install since they just clip into the dedicated slot between the nose pads.</p><p>If you're a Nintendo Switch 2 gamer, you should also check out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/i-found-smart-glasses-that-work-perfectly-on-the-nintendo-switch-2-and-all-your-favorite-systems">this Viture Pro Mobile Dock</a> to play your Switch 2 on the go with these OLED glasses. Steam Deck folks or anyone wanting to use their glasses <em>while</em> charging their phone or laptop should pick up one of these little dongles, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Guermok-Glasses-Converter-Portable-Monitors/dp/B0F3XC8LS3/"><strong>on sale for $19 on Prime Day</strong></a>.</p><h2 id="why-choose-another-pair-2">Why choose another pair?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wyf8hXZNXNFraTzUXUqSJS" name="xreal-one-wearing-angle" alt="Wearing a pair of Xreal One smart glasses to show off the fit and size" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wyf8hXZNXNFraTzUXUqSJS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As I said earlier, the choices in the smart glasses world are seemingly endless, but I'll narrow this down to two alternatives you might want to consider. You can get Viture Pro smart glasses, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/VITURE-Pro-XR-Glasses-Electrochromic/dp/B0D3LRH8G4/"><strong>on sale for $349</strong></a> for Prime Day, which will give you a sharper, brighter display with lenses that can dim themselves when the environment around you gets bright.</p><p>RayNeo Air 3S doesn't offer any kind of light blocking, so they can be sometimes difficult to see if you're using them outside or in a super bright room. If you're just using them in an airport, on a plane, or in our own home, you don't really need this feature. Still, Viture glasses have full support for Viture's extensive system of accessories and add-ons, which is a great reason to pick Viture over other companies.</p><p>Viture also offers myopia adjustment diopter wheels independently for each eye, allowing nearsighted users to adjust for clarity without having to buy a separate set of prescription lenses. That alone cuts $50 off the price if you need glasses, making these a great value so long as your prescription isn't greater than -5.00.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="f484575d-9600-4c28-84f9-efdb9bce293d" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Viture Pro smart glasses: $499" data-dimension48="Viture Pro smart glasses: $499" href="https://www.amazon.com/VITURE-Pro-XR-Glasses-Electrochromic/dp/B0D3LRH8G4/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1152px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="2x4swqbMndsQa27S2EX3ZJ" name="viture-pro-ecosystem-official-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2x4swqbMndsQa27S2EX3ZJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1152" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Viture Pro smart glasses: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/VITURE-Pro-XR-Glasses-Electrochromic/dp/B0D3LRH8G4/" data-dimension112="f484575d-9600-4c28-84f9-efdb9bce293d" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Viture Pro smart glasses: $499" data-dimension48="Viture Pro smart glasses: $499" data-dimension25=""><del>$499</del><strong> $349 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>Viture Pro smart glasses offer an extra-crisp 1080p visuals, 1000 nits of brightness, built-in myopia adjustment diopters up to -5.00, and full support for Viture's extensive range of add-ons and accessories, now on sale for <strong>$150 off </strong>during Prime Day.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/VITURE-Pro-XR-Glasses-Electrochromic/dp/B0D3LRH8G4/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="f484575d-9600-4c28-84f9-efdb9bce293d" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Viture Pro smart glasses: $499" data-dimension48="Viture Pro smart glasses: $499" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p>The king of smart glasses right now are Xreal One, which are on sale for the first time since their launch earlier this year.

The arms adjust between three preset angles, and Xreal's frames are thinner and shaped in a way that doesn't fatigue my ears as much as the RayNeo's that are on sale.

But then Baseus came along and showcased what it can do in this category; the PrimeTrip VR2 Max is designed to take things to a whole new level, thanks to 163W of power delivery and four charging ports in total.</p><p>But what I like the most is that the charger comes with two retractable cables. I recently used a UGREEN car charger <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Retractable-Charging-Cigarette-Compatible/dp/B0DSBRM6BD">that has a built-in retractable cable</a> and thought that was cool, but it isn't as good as what Baseus is offering. Oh, and the best part? The VR2 Max is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Baseus-Retractable-Charger-Charging-PrimeTrip/dp/B0F8T4RH9Y">down to just $29 right now</a>, a sizeable 40% discount on its $49 retail price.

The inclusion of two retractable USB-C cables makes all the difference, and if you need a new car charger, you should just get this. </p><p><strong>‚úÖRecommended if: </strong>You want a car charger that's designed to deal with cable clutter. Both retractable USB-C cables tuck into the body of the charger when not in use. </p><p><strong>‚ùåSkip this deal if: </strong>You don't need as many charging ports. </p><p><strong>Alternative deal: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Retractable-Charging-Cigarette-Compatible/dp/B0DSBRM6BD" data-dimension112="fa5b346f-41e9-4078-996e-0eb50758686a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Alternative deal: UGREEN 90W Retractable Car Charger" data-dimension48="Alternative deal: UGREEN 90W Retractable Car Charger" data-dimension25="$29"><strong>UGREEN 90W Retractable Car Charger </strong></a><strong>‚Äî </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Retractable-Charging-Cigarette-Compatible/dp/B0DSBRM6BD"><strong>$27 on Amazon</strong></a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Baseus-Retractable-Charger-Charging-PrimeTrip/dp/B0F8T4RH9Y" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="fa5b346f-41e9-4078-996e-0eb50758686a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Alternative deal: UGREEN 90W Retractable Car Charger" data-dimension48="Alternative deal: UGREEN 90W Retractable Car Charger" data-dimension25="$29">View Deal</a></p></div><p>Look, I can talk about the power budget and go into detail on how the four ports allocate the 163W available, and how the USB-C1 port goes up to 67W. But I don't need to do all that; all you need to know about this car charger is that it has two retractable USB-C cables ‚Äî each extending to 31.5 inches ‚Äî and they neatly tuck into the charger when not in use. There's an additional USB-C port alongside USB-A connectivity if two cables aren't enough.</p><p>Oh, and did I mention that the charger swivels? It has 180-degree vertical rotation and 270-degree horizontal rotation, so you can easily route the cables to whichever part of the car you or your passengers are sitting in. I used this charger for the better part of two months now, and it has been nothing short of brilliant.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap"

Lets take a good look at both shades of the Galaxy Watch 8.</p><h2 id="walk-into-the-light-or-venture-into-the-dark-side-of-the-moon-2">Walk into the light or venture into the dark side of the moon</h2>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_hero" data-id="81dce15f-7c68-4962-bc9a-d14a04b9ac22">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bPLi3GK48NDVrnUA6ydiWi.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 44mm"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 - Graphite</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Darkly demure</strong></em></p><p>The Graphite variant of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 comes in both 40mm and 44mm case options. You get a simple charcoal black watch band with this color. It's a classic black option that's sure to look good with almost any outift.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_hero" data-id="cb5fe33b-b84e-4753-8d29-82f5c64452cf">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3osjQ7T4Eof4nqKPSLadWi.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 44mm"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 - Silver</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Brilliant shimmer</strong></em></p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 is a pretty picture in Silver, and so is the plain white strap it comes with. Whether you choose the 40mm or 44mm option, it looks good in both. However, Silver isn't as versatile as Graphite when it comes to matching with outfits.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div><ul><li><a href="#main"><strong>Back to the top ^</strong></a></li></ul><h2 id="here-s-how-you-should-choose-the-right-galaxy-watch-8-color-for-yourself-2">Here's how you should choose the right Galaxy Watch 8 color for yourself</h2><p>Settling on one of the two <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-series-launch">Samsung Galaxy Watch 8</a> color variants isn't a tough call to make. You either go for Silver or Graphite, and the watch bands are secondary. Since the bands can always be swapped out to suit the outfit or occasion anyway, don't focus on them when making your choice.</p><p>I highly recommend opting for the colorway that matches the majority of your clothes and accessories. For example, I prefer to wear gold or rose gold accessories, so a Silver Galaxy Watch 8 would clash awfully with most of my jewelry. That's why I'd personally buy the Graphite variant of the Watch 8. I can always swap the straps to a golden metal link one to glam it up or make it look more elegant. Golden doesn't look that bad with black. I'm sure you get the gist.</p><p>So, if your bracelets and clothes lean more towards a silvery aesthetic, you should get the Silver option instead. It's going to be a thousand times easier to style.</p> ]]></dc:content>

They all get equally loud at 80dB, and the piercing sound is great if you need to locate the keys or wallet. There's Qi charging as standard as well, and they all have modern designs that integrate well with the rest of your accessories.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div

scenarios. The only issue with the keychain is that the keyring is on the smaller side, and it isn't possible to hook a finger inside the keyring. I just took out the tracker and put it on another keyring, and that solved the problem.</p><p>Another annoyance is that these trackers are limited to the Find My network, and they don't show up on Google's redesigned Find Hub. So you'll need to have an iPhone to take advantage of the trackers; I would like to see Satechi roll out Android-based versions of these trackers, but that's not on the cards now. If you've got an iPhone and want reliable Qi-enabled trackers, the FindAll collection gets my recommendation.</p><p><em><strong>For everything on Amazon Prime Day, head to our </strong></em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><em><strong>ultimate buying guide</strong></em></u></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></p> ]]></dc:content>

You can also choose between wired and wireless charging options. Wired car chargers are significantly more efficient compared to slower cordless picks, and Anker and UGREEN's options are the best in the biz.</p><p>Both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/anker-car-charger-retractable-cable">Anker Nano 75W Car Charger</a> and UGREEN Nexode Car Charger 90W are on sale for the four-day Amazon Prime Day shopping bonanza. This means you can score super fast charging upgrades for your car on the cheap while the sale lasts. The bonus is that you don't need to worry about buying a cable either, as both car chargers come with retractable USB-C cables.</p><p>I have used both car chargers and found them equally suitable. They both offer a plug-and-play experience. In terms of the built-in cable size, I give Anker the win over UGREEN because it's got a slightly longer 29.4-inch or 75cm cable, whereas the UGREEN cord measures 70cm long. However, UGREEN's option has more ports and can deliver a higher power output.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="121fac69-7019-4048-a631-53c7df55d1b9" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="The Anker Nano 75W Car Charger plugs into your car's cigarette lighter port.

The projector is straightforward to set up and use, and you don't need to mount it on the ceiling or the other side of the room; as it uses UST tech, you can position it just a few inches away from the wall and still get up to a 120-inch projection.</p><p>The projector has 4K as well as Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos in addition to HDR10+, and it does a fantastic job with 4K content. It gets bright enough that I didn't see any issues with it even with plenty of ambient light, and if you've already had a projector and want to switch to a brighter model or need to set up a home theater, this is one of the best models available today. The LTV-3000 Pro retails for $3,999, but for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CR13MB4F?">Prime Day it's available for $2,449</a> ‚Äî its lowest price yet.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="5d23d16d-2c61-45f8-b393-4f66f974435c" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Other retailers: $2,799 at Best Buy" data-dimension48="Other retailers: $2,799 at Best Buy" data-dimension25="$2449" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CR13MB4F" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:62.87%;"><img id="SPrRfaEbrrWAyRWNjarejC" name="ltv-3000-pro.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SPrRfaEbrrWAyRWNjarejC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1500" height="943" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>The LTV-3000 Pro has outstanding picture quality, and you can easily use it in a room with lots of ambient light.

In that case, I'd recommend getting the VisionMaster Pro 2; it is considerably brighter, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Valerion-VisionMaster-Pro2-Triple-Projector/dp/B0DSBYCZJR">coming in at $2,389 on Amazon</a>, it is also a good deal. </p><p><strong>Alternative deal: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/XGIMI-Projector-Vision-Enhanced-Lumens/dp/B0D8KRD3JK"><strong>XGIMI Aura 2 </strong></a><strong>‚Äî</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/XGIMI-Projector-Vision-Enhanced-Lumens/dp/B0D8KRD3JK"><strong> $2,149 at Amazon</strong></a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CR13MB4F" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="5d23d16d-2c61-45f8-b393-4f66f974435c" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Other retailers: $2,799 at Best Buy" data-dimension48="Other retailers: $2,799 at Best Buy" data-dimension25="$2449">View Deal</a></p></div><p>The only issue with the LTV-3000 Pro is that it doesn't get Android TV installed out of the box. Instead, you get a dongle in the package. This way is honestly better as you can use your own solution ‚Äî I use the projector with the Shield TV Pro. Other than that, it doesn't have any shortcomings.</p><p>The 2,000 lumen brightness ensures the LTV-3000 Pro gets bright enough even with ambient light, and this hasn't been a problem whatsoever in the year I used the projector. Color quality is outstanding thanks to the laser light source, and it excels at 4K Dolby Vision and HDR content. The built-in sound is great in its own right, but I suggest using it with a soundbar to unlock its full potential ‚Äî I connected it to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bose-smart-ultra-dolby-atmos-soundbar-ideal-rocking-out">Bose's excellent Smart Home Ultra soundbar</a> and Bass Module 700 subwoofer.</p><p>I use the LTV-3000 Pro with a 90-inch projector, but it goes up to 150 inches, making it the ideal choice if you're just getting started with a home theater. The projector is clearly built to last, and the picture quality gives it a definite edge over most models in this segment. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CR13MB4F">deal pricing of $2,449</a> makes it that much more alluring; it's still quite a lot of cash, but you're also getting one of the best 4K UST projectors available today.</p> ]]></dc:content>

I have a dedicated thermal camera, but it's much more convenient to use a dongle-sized variant that just plugs into your Android phone.</p><p>This is basically what you get with the iSee thermal camera, a diminutive thermal camera that's available with USB-C or Lightning connectors. I used the USB-C model, and it works just as well with any Android phone. The dongle usually sells for $499, but for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Fluke-TC01B-25Hz-Smartphones-Temperature/dp/B0C9H54GLX">Prime Day it is down to $430</a>. This dongle almost never goes on sale, so if you need a diminutive thermal imaging camera, I highly recommend picking it up.

It's automatically detected by the iSee mobile app when you connect it to your Android phone, and it accurately detects any heat spots ‚Äî I use it extensively to test how hot phones get while gaming. The resolution of 256x192 isn't the best, but it is more than adequate for a thermal camera, and what I like about the dongle is that it detects minor differences in thermal readings.</p><p>You get a range of presets available, and there's even the ability to shoot 25fps footage. The build quality is fantastic; it has a metal chassis, and I didn't see any issues in the six months I used the product. While there are smaller products available, Fluke's consistently-accurate readings and monitoring tools make the iSee an easy recommendation.

Configuring it is just as easy as any other Android TV box, and it runs the latest iteration of Google TV. While I'm not a fan of what Google is doing with its TV OS, there isn't any lag or slowdown while using the KM9 Pro Max ‚Äî it is fluid like few boxes in this category.</p><p>You get full access to the Play Store, so you can easily install all your streaming utilities, including Netflix. There's AV1 decode, letting you take full advantage of HDR within YouTube. Although the box comes with 2GB of RAM, I didn't see any issues with lag whatsoever, and Mecool deserves credit for optimizing the UI. You get 32GB of storage as standard.</p><p>The bundled remote has good in-hand feel, and comes with all the buttons you need ‚Äî and yes, there's a mute button. I don't get why most brands omit the mute button, but I'm glad it's there on the KM9 Pro Max. Overall, this is a reliable Android TV solution if you need something on a budget, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/MECOOL-KM9-Pro-Max-Certification/dp/B0DZT22498/">at $63</a>, it delivers a better value than its rivals.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Currently, rolling out to Gmail for web, the Manage subscriptions feature will sort out all active subscriptions sorted by most frequent senders next to the number of emails they've sent to users in the past few weeks.</p><p>They are accompanied by an Unsubscribe button, which can be done in a single click. Before unsubscribing, users can also directly view the past emails to decide whether they can be unsubscribed once and for all.</p><h2 id="clean-up-your-inbox-2">Clean up your inbox</h2><p>As mentioned, it is currently available for Gmail for web and can be accessed by navigating to Inbox on the top left corner and finding the new "Manage subscriptions."

The search giant also developed AI-based defenses, which reduced scam emails by 35%.</p><p>There are several third-party clients that also do a good job in helping users to unsubscribe from unwanted mails and subscriptions, but having it built in native Gmail is a welcome move for many from Google.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Google is known for its camera quality, and the Pixel 9 is no slouch. And the photo editing features make it easy to reimagine part of your image, remove distractions, and much more.</p><p>I've used the Pixel 9 on and off since it launched nearly a year ago, designating it as my "camera phone" for moments when I know I'll need a good photo or two. It's just that reliable, and Google has really stepped up the quality of both its hardware and software. You'll also really enjoy the bevy of AI features, which the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> chip is perfectly capable of handling.</p><p>The biggest omission on the Pixel 9 is the lack of a telephoto lens. However, even then, the AI-enhanced digital zoom does wonders, allowing you to zoom up to 8x with minimal loss of quality. It's things like this that help to fill the gaps, ensuring the Pixel 9 retains as much of a flagship experience as possible.</p><p>You can always pay more for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a>, or you can pay less for the lower-end <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">Pixel 9a</a>.

Instead of paying $900 for the "budget" Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2024-review">Motorola Razr 2024</a> is a much better choice.

It starts with only 128GB of base storage, so you'll need to pay even more than that high $899 sticker price to match the Motorola Razr 2024. It's also powered by the Samsung Exynos 2400 chipset, a year-old platform based on the 4nm process that likely isn't much better or worse than the MediaTek chip inside the Razr 2024.</p><p>It's clear that the Razr 2024 is the better choice. It comes with 256GB of base storage by default, features the same 8GB of RAM, has bigger screens, and includes a higher-capacity battery with faster charging speeds. No matter which way you look at it, the Razr 2024 is better overall than the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE ‚Äî even if their costs were equal.</p><p>Of course, they aren't! This deal price for the Razr 2024 brings the flip phone down under $500, whereas the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE is available for pre-order around the $900 mark. If you were hoping the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE would be your next affordable foldable, fear not, because the Razr 2024 is all that and more.</p><ul><li><em><strong>For more on Prime Day 2025, check out </strong></em><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><em><strong>our ultimate shopping guide</strong></em></u></a><em><strong></strong></em></li></ul><h2 id="prime-day-2025-android-deals-quick-links-67">Prime Day 2025 Android deals ‚Äî quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-2499727057430809917-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>Prime Day is here: see the full list of Amazon deals</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phones: </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Fref_%3Dnav_cs_gb%26bubble-id%3Dcell-phones-accessories%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-2203694892823443518-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">major discounts on Samsung and Pixel</a></li><li><strong>Tablets: </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dtablets%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-2511409197821828773-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">discounted Galaxy Tab and iPad</a></li><li><strong>Chromebooks: </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dchromebooks%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-7106176835731580750-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">up to 28% off Chromebooks</a></li><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Famazonprime%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-3246680232717780065-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>Most Prime Day deals are members-only: sign up for the 30-day trial</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Products from Amazon's own family of devices, which includes Echo smart home tech, Fire TVs, and Kindle e-readers, are also certain to receive major discounts during the four-day sale.</p><h2 id="do-i-have-to-be-a-prime-member-to-shop-during-prime-day-2025-2">Do I have to be a Prime member to shop during Prime Day 2025?</h2><p>Although some deals will be available to the general public, the vast majority of Prime Day offers will be exclusive to Prime members. If you're not a member just yet, it might be worth considering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><strong>Amazon Prime's 30-day free trial</strong></a>. This gives you access to the full range of Prime benefits (including Prime Day discounts) for a full month without paying a cent.

You know what else is a great phone? The Galaxy Z Flip 6. Last year's flip phone just received a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D192WWZ9/">massive $300 Prime Day discount</a>, just in time to make way for Samsung's latest and greatest.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Flip 7 launched at the same $1,099 price as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>, so it's not surprising to see the Z Flip 6 receive a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide">Prime Day</a> discount. However, at $300 off, it's even cheaper than the new "affordable" Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE, which starts at $899. This makes the Galaxy Z Flip 6 an even better deal right now, especially as Samsung is likely trying to clear out stock in favor of its latest phones (many colors are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-z-flip6/buy/galaxy-z-flip6-256gb-unlocked-sm-f741uzyaxaa/">out of stock at Samsung.com</a>).</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/primeday" target="_blank"><strong>Shop all Amazon Prime Day deals</strong></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="4a019165-f1ea-4174-8b28-b4c561b358cf" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="A $300 discount on the Galaxy Z Flip 6 is no joke, and we've seen devices sell out during Prime Day, so you should act quickly before they're gone!

That said, if you'd rather not spend more than $1000 on a new phone, there are plenty of reasons why the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-one-year-later">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> is still worth buying.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Flip 6 is a well-designed phone with impressive durability for a foldable. It also boasts some impressive specs, including a bright display and a powerful Snapdragon chipset. In fact, Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-official-exynos-2500-soc-unpacked-devices-reveal">Exynos 2500 chip</a> appears to be on par with the older Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 powering the Z Flip 6, at least in CPU power.</p><p>And while the Galaxy Z Flip 6 doesn't have the fastest charging speeds, it matches and exceeds those of the Galaxy Z Flip 6, sporting 25W wired and 15W wireless. By contrast, the Galaxy Z Flip 7 drops wireless charging speed to 10W, meaning it will likely take longer to charge its larger battery.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Flip 6 also supports plenty of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> features and will likely receive more features with future updates. After all, Samsung promises 7 years of OS upgrades (with six more to go) for the Z Flip 6, so you don't have to worry about missing out very much if you pick one up now.</p><h2 id="prime-day-2025-android-deals-quick-links-87">Prime Day 2025 Android deals - quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals" target="_blank"><strong>Prime Day is coming: see the full list of Amazon deals</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phones:¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals?ref_=nav_cs_gb&bubble-id=cell-phones-accessories" target="_blank">major discounts on Samsung and Pixel</a></li><li><strong>Tablets:¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=tablets" target="_blank">discounted Galaxy Tab and iPad</a></li><li><strong>Wearables:¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=smartwatches" target="_blank">up to %45 off Garmin watches</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime" target="_blank"><strong>Most Prime Day deals are members-only: sign up for the 30-day trial</strong></a></li></ul><p><em><strong>For everything on Amazon Prime Day, head to our </strong></em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><em><strong>ultimate shopping guide</strong></em></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></p> ]]></dc:content>

It seems this software is another Samsung alternative to Android Auto. As the publication notes, the Korean OEM already provides "Samsung Auto" on its Galaxy phones sold in China. The tipster showed off an alleged look at its UI, which seems to feature whatever app you're using in an off-center area.</p><p>The top right features a tile that says "Good Evening, listen to the brief for..." It reminds us of Samsung's Now Brief feature in One UI 7 (and 8) for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-launch">the Galaxy S25 series</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-z-flip-7-fold-7-flagship-launch-flip-7-fe">recent foldables</a>. Beneath that, with a music note, is a default music app that drivers can take advantage of. This alleged design also sports a navigation bar similar to Galaxy phones and two app bars.</p><p>The tipster claims Samsung's "Auto Dex" will support "8500+ car models of 120+ brands." Additionally, there's a chance users can activate this on their phone. Perhaps that speculation holds merit, considering this rumored look features One UI's navigational icons.</p><h2 id="samsung-continues-with-its-own-take-2">Samsung continues with its own take</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here's a FIRST LOOK at Samsung's 'Auto DeX', supporting 8500+ car models of 120+ brands. The great news is, even if your car doesn't support it or you don't have a car, you can use it with some tricks.

In response <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/GalaxyTechie/status/1942784264463938043">to a comment</a>, the tipster claims "Auto Dex" has not entered internal testing, but rather this is simply "a very early implementation of DeX on Samsung Auto."</p><p>The folks at 9to5 and their long memory brought up Google's old <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-auto-phone-screens-discontinued">Android Auto for phone screens</a>, which was discontinued back in 2022. Essentially, users could have everything Android Auto offered, but in a small package: their phone. This rumored "Auto Dex" from Samsung seems to have been created in a similar vein. There seems to be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/GalaxyTechie/status/1942272781061874011">a slim chance</a> that users outside of China will also get this feature, but we'll have to wait and see.</p><p>As far as Android Auto is concerned, for the rest of us, a recent rumor suggests Google is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-auto/android-auto-smart-glasses-integration-code-rumors">working on integrating smart glasses</a>. Those hopes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-auto/android-auto-update-smart-glasses-mention-dashed">were quickly dashed</a> after an update for Android Auto removed all mentions of "glasses" within its code. There's speculation that there could've been a translation error, considering that the rumor originated from an overseas discovery.</p><p>It's also worth mentioning that Samsung was also spotted working on its own version of Android's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-android-earthquake-alerts-user-emergency-control">earthquake alerts</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

But those aren't always easy to tote around with you, especially if you don't carry a large bag around at all times. That's where the Onyx Boox Palma 2 comes in, a phone-sized e-reader that's currently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/BOOX-Mobile-Fingerprint-Recognition-Microphones/dp/B0DTTV6M81"><strong>10% off</strong></a> for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide">Prime Day</a>.</p><p>While 10% isn't the biggest discount we've seen during Amazon's 4-day event, Onyx doesn't regularly discount the Boox Palma or Palma 2, so it's a rare deal. If you don't believe me, check out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0DTTV6M81">Camelcamelcamel page</a> and look at the <em>very</em> flat price graph over the past few months.</p><p>The first time I got the original Palma at the end of 2023, my wife immediately laid claim to it when I was done writing the review. Once the second one came out, the upgrade was a no-brainer, especially given how often she uses it. That thing goes with her everywhere!</p><p>For the cost of a budget-priced phone, you'll be getting a cutting-edge Android-powered e-reader with a gorgeous black & white Carta E Ink display. It's got a fast refresh rate that feels more like a normal screen than an old Kindle, but the eye-friendly nature of E Ink and its ultra comfortable display that's easy to see in any light.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><strong>Prime Day deals and FAQ</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-ca-5457778577287776063-20" target="_blank"><strong>Shop all Amazon Prime Day deals</strong></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="98acb03b-cccb-4f27-b1e8-a4b943e16fd9" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Was: $299.99" data-dimension48="Was: $299.99" data-dimension25="$" href="https://www.amazon.com/BOOX-Mobile-Fingerprint-Recognition-Microphones/dp/B0DTTV6M81" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="qPf7RC9nxBcva3iUT6gRGf" name="onyx-boox-palma-2-square-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qPf7RC9nxBcva3iUT6gRGf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Onyx Boox Palma 2 üìñ</strong></p><p><strong>Was: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/BOOX-Mobile-Fingerprint-Recognition-Microphones/dp/B0DTTV6M81" target="_blank" data-dimension112="98acb03b-cccb-4f27-b1e8-a4b943e16fd9" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Was: $299.99" data-dimension48="Was: $299.99" data-dimension25="$"><del>$299.99</del></a></p><p><strong>Now:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BOOX-Mobile-Fingerprint-Recognition-Microphones/dp/B0DTTV6M81" target="_blank"><strong>$269.99 at Amazon</strong></a><em></em></p><p>"Unlike a Kindle, you can get your books, apps, or whatever you want from anywhere you want on the Palma 2.

It's a great way to read content from anywhere since it's powered by Android and isn't locked behind a walled garden like an Amazon Kindle.</p><p><strong>‚ùåSkip this deal if: </strong>you're looking for a full E Ink phone replacement. This might be the size of a phone, but you can't stick a SIM card in it. It's also only a black & white display, so no fancy color E Ink here.</p><p><strong>Price check üíµ: </strong><a href="https://www.target.com/p/boox-6-13-palma2/-/A-1001353904">$299 at Target</a> |<strong> </strong><a href="https://shop.boox.com/products/palma2">$299 at Onyx</a></p><p><strong>Alternative deal ü™ô: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bigme-Smartphone-Hibreak-Android-36-Level/dp/B0FF4FWQFP"><strong>Bigme Hibreak Pro E Ink phone - </strong><del>$459</del><strong> $436.05 at Amazon</strong></a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/BOOX-Mobile-Fingerprint-Recognition-Microphones/dp/B0DTTV6M81" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="98acb03b-cccb-4f27-b1e8-a4b943e16fd9" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Was: $299.99" data-dimension48="Was: $299.99" data-dimension25="$">View Deal</a></p></div><p>The Onyx Boox Palma 2 is an upgrade over the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/onyx-boox-palma-review">Boox Palma</a> in subtle ways, but that doesn't mean it's not nicer to use. One of the best new features is the fingerprint scanner built into the side-mounted power button, something the original release didn't have. That means you can have the same level of biometric security on your e-reader as you do on your phone!</p><p>It's also got a newer, faster chipset inside and comes installed with Android 13, whereas the original release only features Android 11. The OS version doesn't usually matter much on these types of devices since security updates are often delivered through the Google Play backend, but apps eventually stop supporting older versions of Android, so having something newer is always preferable.</p><p>Aside from the diminutive size that you'll love, this display is something you need to see in action, especially if you're coming from an older e-reader like a Kindle. Gone are the days when the whole screen would have to flash just to change the page. This one refreshes more like a normal phone display and can even play back videos and games so long as you don't mind that it's only black & white.</p><p>Plus, since it's E Ink, it's actually <em>easier</em> to read in the sun than inside, the polar opposite of most phones. That, plus the eye-friendly nature of E Ink displays and a backlight that's totally flicker-free, ensures that you can read for hours on end without worrying about eye strain. It's a win-win!</p><ul><li>For more on Prime Day 2025, check out¬†<a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><strong>our ultimate shopping guide</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

After all, underdog e-reader manufacturers like Kobo and BOOX had been producing full color devices for a while, and now they had to compete against the "Big A" with technology that they had perfected long before. And indeed, once a giant company like Amazon gets involved in a technology like this, there&apos;s no going back to simple black-and-white e-readers.¬†</p><h2 id="need-a-backup-plan-2">Need a backup plan?</h2><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="b608c421-b21e-4fc0-a60a-ac10d7fded17" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Kobo Libra Colour: $249.99" data-dimension48="Kobo Libra Colour: $249.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/Kobo-Glare-Free-KaleidoTM-Audiobooks-Waterproof/dp/B0CZXWGK79/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:773px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:112.42%;"><img id="WCKMQqCVLd4GpVBbKahPEJ" name="Kobo Libra Colour" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WCKMQqCVLd4GpVBbKahPEJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="773" height="869" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Kobo Libra Colour: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kobo-Glare-Free-KaleidoTM-Audiobooks-Waterproof/dp/B0CZXWGK79/" data-dimension112="b608c421-b21e-4fc0-a60a-ac10d7fded17" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Kobo Libra Colour: $249.99" data-dimension48="Kobo Libra Colour: $249.99"><del>$249.99</del> <strong>$209.99 with Prime at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>If you're looking for something a little different, the 7-inch Kobo Libra Colour is another great option, boasting a waterproof design, audiobook support, and features like Dark Mode.
