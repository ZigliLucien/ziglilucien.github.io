One small mistake and you could be stuck with bubbles or dust trapped under the screen protector for months, or maybe even years!</p><p>The thought of a bad screen protector installation job might scare you off, but a screen guard is essential to protect your phone from everyday wear and tear.

It's very affordable in Asia, and you're guaranteed to get a neat, bubble-free application.</p><p>Over the years, I have started to try to apply screen protectors myself because I go through a lot of phones. And I never use any phone without a screen protector, even if it's only a temporary review or test that'll last a month or two. After all, you never know when an accident will happen.</p><p>Spigen is one of the few name brands that offer reasonably priced screen protector kits. Naturally, as soon as I got my Pixel 10 Pro, I got my hands on the full set for my phone. The kit is the most comprehensive one I have seen. It includes a squigee, dusters, a microfiber cloth, an alignment tray, sticky dust removers, and even a placement mat to hold your phone in place.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2643px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="JRDhDQ3BAjRrP7kBAAnN2o" name="google-pixel-10-pro-spigen-screen-protector-lifestyle-1" alt="Installing the Spigen GLAStR EZ Fit screen protector for the Google Pixel 10 Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JRDhDQ3BAjRrP7kBAAnN2o.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2643" height="1487" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qdeqnKmDn3gdm3iKUaDp9o" name="google-pixel-10-pro-spigen-screen-protector-lifestyle-3" alt="Installing the Spigen GLAStR EZ Fit screen protector for the Google Pixel 10 Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qdeqnKmDn3gdm3iKUaDp9o.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Since there are two screen protectors included in the kit. Each piece of glass comes with its own installation tray. There are also multiple cleaning tools to cover the second application as well.</p><p>The installation process is so simple, even a child could do it. All you have to do is place the Pixel 10 on the mat, clean it up with all the tools provided, and then put the alignment frame on top. It's built to go on top of the phone in a manner that perfectly aligns the screen guard every single time.</p><p>After that, all you have to do is press in the direction that the sticker says so, wait a few seconds, and then pull the tab. That's it! If there are any bubbles, simply use the squeegee to push them out. It's stupidly easy to achieve a beautiful installation with the Spigen GlasTR EZ FIT screen protector kit on your Pixel 10.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3619px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="EKTyRUoaNkndagagzSUBvn" name="google-pixel-10-pro-spigen-screen-protector-lifestyle-4" alt="Installing the Spigen GLAStR EZ Fit screen protector for the Google Pixel 10 Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EKTyRUoaNkndagagzSUBvn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3619" height="2036" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I was over the moon to see that the Spigen Optik EZ Fit camera lens protector kit is almost as thorough. The only thing it's missing is the placement mat. But if you get the screen protector as well, like I did, you can simply reuse that mat for the camera lens protector installation.</p><p>There are two sets of everything in the box: a cleaning kit, a squeegee, and two lens protectors with two frames. Just like the screen protector, you tidy up the Pixel 10's camera bar using the provided tools until it's sparkling clean before applying the frame. After that, simply press the lens into place and pull the tab. Voila! Perfection achieved within minutes.</p><p>For just <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-AluminaCore-Aluminum-Enhanced-Durability-Resistance/dp/B0D851Z6N8/"><strong>$19.99 for the Pixel 10 screen protector</strong></a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Protector-Glas-tR-Designed-Friendly/dp/B0FBDQ73HY/"><strong>$15.99 for the camera bar protector</strong></a>, Spigen delivers phenomenal value. The glass imitates the feel and touch response of the Pixel 10's own display, so you don't even feel like you have a screen guard on. It's definitely the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/best-google-pixel-10-screen-protectors">best Pixel 10 screen protector kit</a> to get.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The Chinese OEM announced its newest series today <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mi.com/global/discover/article?id=5471">via a press release</a>, highlighting the new goods consumers will find domestically. Kicking off the series is the company's base Xiaomi 17, which mirrors the design consumers got with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15">Xiaomi 15</a>. The newer phone sports a 6.3-inch compact design with rounded corners, flat sides, and a flat display.</p><p>With LIPO technology, Xiaomi states the base 17 can reach 3,500nits of peak brightness. The camera array—its look and design—almost makes one say it resembles Apple's iPhone a little. Either way, the Xiaomi 17's camera array features a 50MP primary lens with f/1.67 aperture (good for low-light situations).</p><p>Giving this device a major power boost is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5-launch">Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</a>.</p><p>Its telephoto is reportedly bringing in a Leica 60mm "floating lens" design at f/2.0 aperture and 10cm close-up zoom.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1669px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.02%;"><img id="LthmhoVLw7tTYfoeG3HDyd" name="xiaomi-17-base-model" alt="The Xiaomi 17 features a squared camera array, flat sides, and a flat display that comes in at 6.3-inches." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LthmhoVLw7tTYfoeG3HDyd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1669" height="935" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Xiaomi)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Wrapping things up is a 7,000mAh battery for this compact phone. Xiaomi states this battery should excel with an extended battery lifespan and "excellent low-temperature endurance." Additionally, over the last series, the Xiaomi 17 features 100W wired charging, 50W wireless charging, and "compatibility with the 100W PPS universal charging protocol."</p><p>The base model features the following RAM/storage configs: 12/256GB, 12/512GB, and 16/512GB. The Xiaomi 17 starts at 4,499 Yuan (~$630).</p><p>There are three total devices in this new series, and that's where Xiaomi goes next: the 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max. The company is touting these two devices as the pinnacle of its recent innovations this year. Just like the base model, the Xiaomi 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max feature Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5. The Xiaomi 17 Pro features a 6.3-inch display. This display, just like the base model, utilizes an M10 Display Panel and SuperRED luminous material for efficiency and enhanced brightness.</p><p>However, the major advancement for it is the "Dynamic Back Display."</p><h2 id="the-xiaomi-17-pro-2">The Xiaomi 17 Pro</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1670px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.05%;"><img id="iiKUetRx3cwYKGFJrKr8NZ" name="xiaomi-17-pro-series-four-colors" alt="The Xiaomi 17 Pro series features a Dynamic Back Display capable of showing AI wallpapers, dynamic notifications, and more." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iiKUetRx3cwYKGFJrKr8NZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1670" height="936" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Xiaomi)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Incorporated with the phone's dual camera array on its rear panel is the 2.6-inch Dynamic Back Display. This display, which Xiaomi says will blend a dual-screen design for its smartphone, "enhances lifestyle and efficiency under various scenarios." This secondary display provides users with a customizable watch face, AI-generated wallpapers, "virtual pets," dynamic notifications, notes, and more.</p><p>Regarding those AI wallpapers, Xiaomi states users can lean on their photos for this feature. Real-time notifications on the Dynamic Back Display include flight alerts, train ticket alerts, delivery info for food orders, and more. More importantly, just like a foldable, this secondary screen can help users take photos, whether it's of other people or themselves.</p><p>Xiaomi draws attention to a special gaming case for the 17 Pro and Pro Max, which turns the models into a retro gaming console when the main display is off.</p><p>The Xiaomi 17 Pro features two 50MP lenses within this back display, with the main camera receiving f/1.67 aperture capabilities. Specifically for the 17 Pro, the post states consumers will find an inverted floating lens telephoto that supports up to 20cm macro shots.

Like the 17 Pro, the 17 Pro Max's back display is 2.6 inches and supports AI wallpapers, customizable watch faces, dynamic notifications, and more.</p><p>While the Pro Max's 50MP primary lens mirrors the others, Xiaomi states it offers a powerful 5x periscope lens with hardware-level HDR support.

The Venu 3 looks great indoors and is perfectly readable outdoors, but the Venu 4 matches the brightness standard of most other smartwatches these days.</p><p>Another subtle change is that the Venu 4 display border no longer has clock markings along the edge at five-second intervals. Sportier Garmins tend to add words and numbers in the margins, making the Venu 4 much more subtle and defined by the watch face.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Venu 4 didn't upgrade the Venu 3's Gorilla Glass 3 protection. Garmin reserves sapphire glass for premium models like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-venu-x1-review">Venu X1</a>, not acknowledging that "mid-range" models like the Venu 4 and Forerunner 570 cost hundreds more than other watches with higher-end scratch protection.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="bAHXaYEvtLaqavhWBYfqdh" name="Garmin-Venu-3-side-buttons.jpeg" alt="Side view of the Garmin Venu 3's metal buttons" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bAHXaYEvtLaqavhWBYfqdh.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Venu series skips Garmin's typical five-button layout, relying on two buttons and touch controls. But the Venu 3 added a unique third button for shortcuts — which I found quite convenient — before the Venu 4 (and Venu X1) removed it. I'd guess that not enough people used it, and casuals got it confused with the Back button too often. Plus, it detracted from the Venu series' minimalist look.</p><p>With the Venu 4, the main Start button is smaller and rounder, but still steel-coated, while the Back button keeps the rectangular look.</p><p>Both watches have a stainless steel bezel, but the Venu 4 bezel is smooth where the Venu 3's was ridged. I'd say these design differences are a matter of preference, rather than one being "better" than the other; either bezel is more attractive than the rounded aluminum bezel on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-vivoactive-6-review">Vivoactive 6</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="J47MVuPqQ4scFjcm5g92PS" name="Garmin-Venu-4-weighted-ball-workout-photo" alt="A photo of the Garmin Venu 4 on a man's wrist as he works out with an exercise ball." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/J47MVuPqQ4scFjcm5g92PS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The most notable design change is that the Venu 4 uses a blend of fiber-reinforced polymer and stainless steel in the case, giving it a more refined look than the Venu 3 but keeping it lighter than the steel <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Garmin Fenix 8</a>.</p><p>Garmin managed to keep the Venu 4 relatively skinny — the 41mm model is still 12mm thick, while the 45mm model is 0.5mm thicker — but both sizes are 9g and 6g heavier than their predecessors, respectively. It's not a massive difference, but where the Venu 3 was lighter than most Garmins, the Venu 4's weight is more typical for the brand.</p><p>Lastly, the Venu 4 colors are pretty much unchanged — Slate, Silver, and a gold option for the smaller model — and Garmin once again gave the Venu 4 silicone bands with smaller (less breathable) holes than on the sporty Forerunner bands. But if you buy it from Garmin, you can customize the Venu 4 with a fabric or leather band instead.</p><h2 id="garmin-venu-4-vs-3-hardware-sensors-battery-life-2">Garmin Venu 4 vs. 3: Hardware, sensors, & battery life</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="gbSyFeJY9aXLDo9nRdSUHK" name="Garmin-Forerunner-970-voice-assistant" alt="The Garmin Forerunner 970 on a table outside, the display showing the text "Try Saying 'What can I say?'" for the Voice Assistant." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gbSyFeJY9aXLDo9nRdSUHK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Venu 4's new voice assistant on the Forerunner 970 </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Garmin doesn't advertise its processors, but the Venu 4 should run on slightly newer hardware, matching other 2024 and 2025 watches with the newer Garmin OS. This should mitigate the loss of the third shortcut button, because apps and functions are much easier to find with the new UI.</p><p>Both the Venu 4 and Venu 3 have a mic and speaker for Bluetooth calls and passthrough commands to your phone's Gemini or Siri assistant. But the newer OS enables on-watch voice commands like starting a workout or pulling up your sleep score.

Two years later, even ultra-expensive models like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-pro-announced-with-lte-satellite-and-microled-key-highlights">Fenix 8 Pro</a> still use this sensor suite.</p><p>Garmin has patented <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-has-patented-long-term-blood-glucose-tracking-heres-how-itd-work">long-term glycated hemoglobin tracking</a>, hemocrit tracking, and other new metrics that we'd have loved to see the Venu 4 introduce. Instead, the only new Venu 4 health features are software-based, which we'll discuss in the next section.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8192px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BwfPiNmLwk7eLns9ey8LnR" name="Garmin-Venu-4-flashlight-photo" alt="A photo of the Garmin Venu 4 at night with the flashlight on and pointing at the camera." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BwfPiNmLwk7eLns9ey8LnR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8192" height="4608" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Like most 2025 Garmins, the Venu 4 adds a built-in LED flashlight with four white brightness settings and one dim red setting, all accessible by long-pressing the Back button. You can set it to blink or strobe during nighttime activities to avoid collisions or hold your arm steady to illuminate a small portion of the road ahead of you.</p><p>What's slightly more surprising is that the Venu 4 now has dual-band GPS tracking! The Venu 3 — and even the $800 Venu X1 — use all-systems GNSS, which delivers dependably accurate data in normal circumstances but isn't quite as <em>pinpoint</em> accurate in tougher conditions. It makes the Venu 4 more appealing to the Forerunner and Fenix crowd.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="4rdbZRsBBrhq35Cyzuhaoi" name="Garmin-Venu-3-body-battery.jpeg" alt="A Body Battery chart on the Garmin Venu 3, showing stress levels in the background contributing to higher battery drain." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4rdbZRsBBrhq35Cyzuhaoi.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another noticeable trend with recent Garmin watches is that their doubled brightness corresponds to lower battery life. The Venu 4 45mm only lasts 12 days (four with AOD), while the Venu 3 45mm lasts 14 days (five with AOD). It's a slight compromise, but an easier one to accept than the Venu X1 (eight days or two with AOD).</p><p>If you're looking at a smaller model, both the Venu 4 and 3 41mm hit 10 days per charge, but the older model lasts an extra two days in AOD mode. And the Venu 4 41mm's 12 multi-band GPS hours are low for any Garmin watch.</p><h2 id="garmin-venu-4-vs-3-software-and-features-2">Garmin Venu 4 vs. 3: Software and features</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8186px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LHjEway6iNHMBwYgKeKUrS" name="Garmin-Venu-4-push-ups-photo" alt="A photo of the Garmin Venu 4 on a man's wrist as he does weighted push-ups." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LHjEway6iNHMBwYgKeKUrS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8186" height="4605" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><div ><table><caption>Garmin Venu 4 vs. 3 key software</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Garmin Venu 4</p></th><th  ><p>Garmin Venu 3</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Health & Wellness</p></td><td  ><p>Body Battery, All-day stress, Sleep Coach, <strong>Sleep alignment</strong>, <strong>Sleep consistency</strong>, <strong>Smart Wake alarm</strong>, Nap Detection, Breathing variations, Health Snapshot, <strong>Health Status</strong>, <strong>Lifestyle logging</strong></p></td><td  ><p>Body Battery, All-day stress, Sleep Coach, Nap Detection, Breathing variations, Health Snapshot</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Accessibility</p></td><td  ><p>Wheelchair mode, <strong>color filters, spoken watch face</strong></p></td><td  ><p>Wheelchair mode</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Workouts</p></td><td  ><p><strong>Personal: Daily suggested workouts for running, cycling, walking, and overall fitness</strong></p><p><strong>Premade: </strong>Cardio, HIIT, <strong>Multisport</strong>, Pilates, Strength, Wheelchair, Yoga</p></td><td  ><p><strong>Personal: </strong>None</p><p><strong>Premade: </strong>Cardio, HIIT, Pilates, Strength, Wheelchair, Yoga</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Coaching</p></td><td  ><p><strong>Garmin Running Coach, Cycling Coach, Strength Coach, Fitness Coach</strong></p></td><td  ><p>Running Coach Experts</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Training</p></td><td  ><p>Intensity minutes, HRV Status, VO2 Max, workout benefit, recovery time, <strong>training status, training load focus / ratio, training effect, training readiness, heat/ altitude acclimation</strong></p></td><td  ><p>Intensity minutes, HRV Status, VO2 Max, workout benefit, recovery time</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Running</p></td><td  ><p>Running dynamics, running power, <strong>performance condition, grade-adjusted pace, lactate threshold, Pacepro, race predictor</strong></p></td><td  ><p>Running dynamics, running power</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Courses</p></td><td  ><p>Back to start, <strong>TracBack, downloadable courses, breadcrumb navigation, Up Ahead, distance to destination</strong></p></td><td  ><p>Back to start</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The table above doesn't cover <em>every</em> new Venu 4 software feature, but I've emphasized the highlights.

The Venu 4, however, is getting a new generalized "Fitness Coach" that "provides personalized workouts for over 25 different fitness activities – from walking and indoor cycling to rowing, HIIT, and more."</p><p>This feels tailored to the Venu series, which has traditionally focused more on indoor gym or home workouts with animations and muscle maps. And the same goes for the new "mixed session activity" profile, which will let you track different gym workouts in one general activity instead of splitting them up or using one "Cardio" activity.</p><figure class="van-image-figure pull-right inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="pwBuxQnrGUCNtYxsMepxRK" name="garmin-venu-4-health-status-screenshot" alt="A render of the Garmin Venu 4 showing the user's "Last Sleep" data with Heart Rate and HRV stats against their baseline, with a phone next to the watch showing more in-depth Health Status data." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pwBuxQnrGUCNtYxsMepxRK.png" mos="" align="right" fullscreen="1" width="800" height="800" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-right expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class="pull-right inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Health Status shows how your body's nightly heart rate, blood oxygen, HRV, skin temperature, and respiration rate compare against your baseline. It then warns you via the Morning Report if you have any "outliers" as a sign of illness or poor lifestyle choices.</p><p>On that note, Lifestyle logging has you tell Garmin the positive, negative, or neutral actions you've taken throughout the day so that it can provide insights into their physiological impact on metrics like stress and sleep quality. You can log eating or drinking coffee late, having a period or migraine, wearing a CPAP, getting a massage or acupuncture, or <em>many</em> other options.</p><p>The Venu 3 will receive both of these features, but only in the Connect <em>app</em>; if you want a Health Status watch widget or easy on-wrist logging, you'll need the Venu 4.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="c2kQfCzQT8XnTLws6Rf9wS" name="Garmin-Venu-4-accessibility" alt="A photo of a disabled basketball player in a wheelchair, bouncing the ball while wearing the Garmin Venu 4 in the other." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/c2kQfCzQT8XnTLws6Rf9wS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Venu 3 first introduced a wheelchair mode and tracked pushes instead of steps. The Venu 4 will build on this with accessibility features for the colorblind (color filters like grayscale or red/green) and the visually impaired (a spoken watch face and hourly vocal alerts with health data).</p><p>More broadly, Garmin will build on the Venu 3's sleep coach and enhanced body battery data with the Venu 4, judging your circadian rhythm to determine "how aligned the body is to its inner sleep cycle." It'll also track your "sleep consistency" after seven days of tracking.</p><h2 id="garmin-venu-4-vs-venu-3-which-should-you-buy-or-should-you-upgrade-2">Garmin Venu 4 vs. Venu 3: Which should you buy, or should you upgrade?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8192px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2WXustBPFucpSfKJWfVtKS" name="Garmin-Venu-4-yoga" alt="A photo of the Garmin Venu 4 on a woman's wrist as she does a yoga pose on a mat." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2WXustBPFucpSfKJWfVtKS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8192" height="4608" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Garmin watches are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/are-garmin-watches-like-fenix-8-pro-getting-too-expensive">getting more expensive</a>, so the $550 Venu 4 doesn't surprise me. But it's still expensive for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watch</a>; the Venu 3 felt more accessible, in the same range as other "normal" smartwatches. You can argue that dual-band GPS, flashlight, training load, and other perks are worth $100 extra, but it's not clear if Venu fans will care about these perks as much as Fenix or Forerunner users.</p><p>Ultimately, I think your upgrade decision will come down to the new health and training tools, more than the hardware. Do you want a new personalized training plan, or running/ cycling workouts as cross-training for your gym workouts? Or do you want more insights on how to live a healthier lifestyle with better sleep? If this sounds intriguing, the Venu 4 will be a good fit.</p><p>If that all sounds superfluous, I'd say you can stick with the Venu 3 and hold out until 2027 for a Venu 5 with newer health sensors. Or if you're weighing the Venu 3 on sale, I'd say it remains one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">best Garmin watches</a>, even if the Venu 4 is objectively better on most fronts.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="170e74e0-3471-40e4-88f2-75ec490af8c1">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3egxn4mWgBFBcAPJYaZ6uC.jpg' alt="Render of the black 45mm Garmin Venu 4, the display showing Lifestyle logging menu with options like Late Caffeine and Alcohol."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Garmin Venu 4</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Mixing lifestyle with fitness</strong></em></p><p>Choose the Garmin Venu 4 if you like the Venu's subtle, stylish look and emphasis on health and sleep guidance, but resented that older models had limited training guidance.

These glasses last nearly twice as long on a single charge versus the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses</a>.

The battery life of each pair is also nearly double that is Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 1), delivering 60% more photos and video capture per charge, plus longer audio playback and livestreaming.

I took these styles out for testing and found that Oakley Meta HSTN don't stay on as well as the Ray-Bans if you tilt your head a lot. In this case, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/sBL0acIBb2Y?si=IezdCieQBb_xM-sm&t=137">I used burpees as a test</a>, but skateboarding or other intense sports like that could easily see your glasses flying off if you don't have a chance to push them back up.</p><p>That's at least a little ironic since the Oakley's are geared more toward athletes than Ray-Ban Metas. On the flip side, Oakley Meta HSTN PRIZM lenses are a unique take on tinted lenses that work exceptionally well in the sun, blocking out a significant portion of light and adding a vibrant hue to your world. You can only get them on Oakley glasses, so while they're a pricier upgrade, they're worth it for folks who spend a lot of time outside.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kmKeGuJSGAC3PuSEwE9Mpm" name="oakley-meta-hstn-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-prizm-lens-color-comparison" alt="Comparing Oakley Meta HSTN Prizm lenses with Ray-Ban Meta transition lenses to see the color difference" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kmKeGuJSGAC3PuSEwE9Mpm.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="aZhCor9KExLYe7L9pYExbm" name="oakley-meta-hstn-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-prizm-lens-tint-comparison" alt="Comparing Oakley Meta HSTN Prizm lenses with Ray-Ban Meta transition lenses for tinting" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aZhCor9KExLYe7L9pYExbm.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) also wins on sheer number of style options. Oakley Meta HSTN has just one frame style with four different color options. From there, you can also choose from six different lens colors and types: clear, Transitions grey, Transitions amethyst, PRIZM Ruby, PRIZM deep water polarized, and PRIZM black polarized.</p><p>Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) are offered in three main styles: Wayfarer, Headliner, and Skyler. Wayfarers are available in six different colors, Skylers are available in seven different colors, and Headliners are available six different colors. Each style also includes the option of choosing different lens types and colors, from transitions, polarized lenses, prescription lenses, or plain clear lenses.</p><p>That gives the Ray-Bans the clear edge but, as with anything fashion-related, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. As a bonus, the cheapest pair of Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) smart glasses is $20 cheaper than Oakley Meta HSTN, which is great if you just want a snazzy color and standard, clear lenses.</p><h2 id="ray-ban-meta-gen-2-vs-oakley-meta-hstn-glasses-a-great-pair-of-smart-glasses-2">Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) vs. Oakley Meta HSTN glasses: A great pair of smart glasses</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Fab4taxMjQQ2osmqxSfRxD" name="Ray-Ban-Meta-Gen-2-glasses-selfie-Black" alt="A selfie of the author wearing Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) smart glasses with Black lenses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Fab4taxMjQQ2osmqxSfRxD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Regardless if you pick Oakley Meta HSTN or Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2), you're getting a great pair of smart glasses that'll last you most of the day and come packed with exciting Meta AI features.</p><p>What's more is that the new video recording features packed inside <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oakley-meta-vanguard-smart-glasses-hands-on">Oakley Meta Vangaurd</a> smart glasses are also coming to both Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) and Oakley Meta HSTN.</p><p>That includes slow-motion video recording, as well as hyperlapse recording.

At one of Qualcomm's designated zones, the publication reports that Samsung's XR headset, currently known as "Project Moohan," was inside a glass case with its branding showcased prominently.</p><p>Summit visitors were able to get a clear look at the device in its entirety, though Samsung was reportedly not sharing any details—Qualcomm neither. The device <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-gear/samsungs-xr-headset-could-finally-launch-in-september">looks pretty similar</a> to what we've seen shown off from Google's side and Samsung's side this year.</p><p>The large front houses the display technologies (supposedly OLEDoS tech) and everything else Samsung needs for the XR headset to function. Now, The Elec cites Qualcomm, which spoke briefly about its chipset, the Snapdragon 8 Elite (from 2024), stating it supports "smooth photo editing and video speed control with on-device AI." The publication speculates that Samsung's headset could sport some of these capabilities once users get their hands on it.</p><p>It's also been reiterated that Project Moohan will receive a healthy dose of Google's Gemini.</p><h2 id="samsung-s-first-xr-headset-is-inbound-2">Samsung's first XR headset is inbound</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:866px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:69.28%;"><img id="HPngbyiongeXT7q4x6M3jQ" name="samsung-project-moohan-summit-2025-front" alt="A snapshot of Samsung's XR headset, Project Moohan, in a glass display case at Qualcomm's Snapdragon Summit 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HPngbyiongeXT7q4x6M3jQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="866" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: The Elec)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:945px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:63.49%;"><img id="TnuGR3r3BvsgACyAF6TaiQ" name="samsung-project-moohan-summit-2025-inside-view" alt="A snapshot of Samsung's XR headset, Project Moohan, in a glass display case at Qualcomm's Snapdragon Summit 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TnuGR3r3BvsgACyAF6TaiQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="945" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: The Elec)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>All we can do now (for a little while longer) is speculate on the device's specs, which, according to some previous rumors, include <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-could-use-sony-4k-micro-oled-displays-in-project-moohan-headset">Sony 4K micro-OLED displays. </a>This display could provide the XR headset with 3,552 × 3,840 resolution, 1,000-nit brightness, and 90fps capabilities.

You get a massive screen, for example, and decent cameras with a durable build, but a slightly less powerful processor. The result is a premium phone alternative without the huge price tag of the regular series models.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 FE is the latest addition to the FE line.

It comes in Navy, Jetblack, Icyblue, or White with a bicolor frame and Premium Haze finish. During a brief hands-on with the phone, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-fe-galaxy-tab-s11-ultra-hands-on">our reviewer</a> found that it feels a lot like the Galaxy S24 FE. But he appreciates the smooth matte finish on the back instead of the glossy back of the Galaxy S24 FE, which eliminates the pesky fingerprint problem with the older model. He also loves the contrasting look of the darker colors with the silver aluminum side rails.</p><p>Equipped with a 6.7-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2x FHD+ display that sports 2,340 x 1,080 resolution with 120Hz refresh rate and Vision Booster, the Galaxy S25 FE is in line with other Samsung models that cost much more; you might not even be able to tell the difference. Peak brightness is a decent 1,900 nits as well.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4578px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5Z7LDSAyX8gRv3fH3zyZXS" name="Samsung-S25-FE-official-images" alt="Samsung launches its budget new S25 FE" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5Z7LDSAyX8gRv3fH3zyZXS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4578" height="2575" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/Android Central )</span></figcaption></figure><p>Boasting an Armor Aluminum frame, the screen is covered with Corning Gorilla Glass Victus+ and the phone sports an IP68 rating, so you can be confident it’s protected against dust and water. Most notably, it’s the slimmest and lightest FE phone from Samsung ever, measuring just 7.4mm thin and weighing 190 grams. Compare that to the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE, which is 8mm thin and weighs 213 grams, and it’s a noticeable enough difference. “Anytime you can get a 6.7-inch smartphone under 200 grams,” our reviewer notes, “it’s worth taking note of – this is a difference you’ll feel in both your hand and pocket.”</p><p>It comes with either 128GB, 256GB, or 512GB storage, which is fairly standard. But you get a six-month trial subscription to Google AI Pro with the phone, which includes 2TB cloud storage. Just keep in mind that you’ll have to pay up after the half-year ends if you want to continue using it.</p><p>The battery is bigger at 4,900mAh, but it still has the same rated life, giving you about 28 hours of continuous video viewing per charge. Basically, you’ll need to charge either phone daily. The Samsung Galaxy S25 FE does, however, charge more quickly, getting you to 65% in just 30 minutes. It supports 45W wired charging — a marked increase from just 25W in the Galaxy S24 FE — and 25W wireless charging, up from 15W in the previous-generation phone. You’ll need a compatible wireless charger to enjoy the speedier charging rate, though.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nFMkDSensEgPivRafCToGQ" name="samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-home-screen.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy S24 FE home screen in hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nFMkDSensEgPivRafCToGQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Launched in September 2024, the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE is still a solid phone that comes in at around the same price. In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-hands-on">our hands-on</a>, we found that it doesn’t look much different from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-fe-hands-on">Galaxy S23 FE</a> or even the same-sized <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review">Galaxy S24 Plus</a>. Perhaps this is a good thing when it comes to the latter, suggesting the phone looks more premium than it is. Available in Blue, Graphite, Gray, and Mint, it has the same 6.7-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2x FHD+ display with the same resolution, 120Hz refresh rate, and 1,900 nits brightness. So, there’s no upgrade in that respect.</p><p>It has an aluminum frame as well, along with Corning Gorilla Glass Victus+ and an IP68 rating. It’s not quite as slim, but in terms of dimensions beyond the thickness, it’s not far off from the Galaxy S25 FE. This is still a sleek phone with a massive screen.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="EGgoKHnGdVYGf78YNQF5hP" name="samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-rear-cameras-1.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy S24 FE rear cameras" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EGgoKHnGdVYGf78YNQF5hP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You can choose from 128GB or 256GB storage options; there’s no 512GB model. While the battery is a smaller 4,700mAh, you get the same rated battery life. However, as noted, the phone charges more slowly.</p><p>Both phones give you seven software updates and seven years of security support. So, the Samsung Galaxy S25 FE, which launched in September 2025 with Android 16, will be good through 2032 and Android 23. Meanwhile, the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE, which launched with Android 14, will be supported through 2031 and Android 21. In both cases, the phones are still worth considering “current.”</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-fe-vs-samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-the-specs-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 FE vs. Samsung Galaxy S24 FE: The specs</h2><p>Let’s look at the specs of these two phones in a side-by-side comparison.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy S25 FE</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy S24 FE</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>Android 14, (Samsung One UI 8)</p></td><td  ><p>Android 16 (Samsung One UI 6.1)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Navy, Jetblack, Icyblue, White</p></td><td  ><p>Blue, Graphite, Gray, Mint</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Screen Size</p></td><td  ><p>6.7 inches</p></td><td  ><p>6.7 inches</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Screen Resolution</p></td><td  ><p>2,340 x 1,080</p></td><td  ><p>2,340 x 1,080</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Screen Type</p></td><td  ><p>AMOLED FHD+</p></td><td  ><p>AMOLED FHD+</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Refresh Rate</p></td><td  ><p>120Hz</p></td><td  ><p>120Hz</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Exynos 2400</p></td><td  ><p>Exynos 2400e</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>8GB</p></td><td  ><p>8GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>128/256GB/512GB (not expandable)</p></td><td  ><p>128GB/256GB (not expandable)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Cameras</p></td><td  ><p>50MP main wide-angle, 12MP ultra-wide, 8MP telephoto, 12MP front</p></td><td  ><p>50MP main wide-angle, 12MP ultra-wide, 8MP telephoto, 10MP front</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Speakers</p></td><td  ><p>Stereo Speakers</p></td><td  ><p>Stereo Speakers</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>4,900mAh</p></td><td  ><p>4,700mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Wireless Charging</p></td><td  ><p>Yes</p></td><td  ><p>Yes</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Bluetooth</p></td><td  ><p>5.4</p></td><td  ><p>5.3</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Cellular</p></td><td  ><p>5G</p></td><td  ><p>5G</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Size</p></td><td  ><p>161.3 x 76.6 x 7.4 mm</p></td><td  ><p>162 x 77.3 x 8 mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>190 grams</p></td><td  ><p>213 grams</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-fe-vs-samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-usability-features-and-functions-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 FE vs. Samsung Galaxy S24 FE: Usability, features, and functions</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QqjoMXLeFRd8FHrGZRCMaF" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-FE-7" alt="The Samsung Galaxy S25 FE in hands-on photos." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QqjoMXLeFRd8FHrGZRCMaF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While looks and basic specs are important, what you probably really want to know is if there are any marked differences in how these two phones operate and what they can do. The simple answer is, there are some.</p><p>When it comes to the Samsung Galaxy S25 FE, it has a superior Exynos 2400 processor. This is still a step down from the regular line, but it offers a compelling enough experience for some users. Combined with the 13% larger vapor chamber, you get a decent gaming experience without worrying that the phone will overheat. And you can multitask to your heart’s content. Both phones have 8GB of RAM.</p><p>Along with Galaxy AI, which affords features like real-time information and insights, along with some cool photo editing features (discussed in the next section), you get fully integrated Gemini Live with the Samsung Galaxy S25 FE. This unlocks plenty of AI features and assistance, including popular ones like Circle to Search, as well as Browsing Assist, Writing Assist, and more. You can access Gemini seamlessly across apps, affording a unique and helpful experience. As noted, you can try advanced features with the six-month trial to Google AI Pro.</p><p>There’s also One UI 8, which adds things like customized wallpapers and widgets, and the new Samsung Now Bar that provides useful information at a glance and Now Brief, a daily summary of your day. Additionally, there’s Quick Share, which makes it simple to share photos, videos, and files with nearby Samsung devices (the Galaxy S24 FE supports this feature as well, and will be updateable to One UI 8).</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2EFx9998iGenAgS3t8tQH5" name="samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-google-search.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy S24 FE Google search" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2EFx9998iGenAgS3t8tQH5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Samsung Galaxy S24 FE includes AI features, too, but it’s a pared-down set out of the box. You get Galaxy AI and access to features like Circle to Search, Live Translate, Interpreter, Photo Assist, and Browsing Assist. While Gemini Live doesn’t come with the phone out of the box, you are able to upgrade to use it.</p><p>It comes with the Exynos 2400e processor, which is nearly identical to the Exynos 2400 in the Galaxy S25 FE. The Exynos 2400e has a lower clock speed, so it isn’t quite as powerful. But it’s designed to optimize the device, and is sufficient for most. Our reviewer says it feels snappy, so you probably won’t even notice the downgrade unless you’re a heavy, intense user of high-bandwidth apps, like games.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-fe-vs-samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-the-difference-with-the-cameras-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 FE vs. Samsung Galaxy S24 FE: The difference with the cameras</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5712px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wQDCSXAu2sTV6m7dfLGy6T" name="Samsung-S25-FE-official-images" alt="Samsung launches its budget new S25 FE" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wQDCSXAu2sTV6m7dfLGy6T.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5712" height="3213" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/Android Central )</span></figcaption></figure><p>The cameras in these two phones are largely identical, with a 50MP wide-angle main sensor, 12MP ultra-wide, and an 8MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom. The biggest difference is with the front selfie camera, which is 12MP in the Samsung Galaxy S25 FE, 20% higher resolution than the 10MP front camera in the Galaxy S24 FE. This could be a worthwhile upgrade for those who take a lot of selfies, group selfies using the front camera, or who record content for social media and livestream from their phones.</p><p>Speaking of recording content, the Samsung Galaxy S25 FE has some new features that mark an upgrade in this department, including audio erase and auto trim. But these features should be making their way to the Galaxy S24 FE as well. On the AI side, it also adds Writing Assist. It has a low-noise mode for night videos as well.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="84ECwg3FFRzwd59NUHcGEJ" name="samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-dual-recording-2.jpg" alt="Dual Recording on Samsung Galaxy S24 FE" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/84ECwg3FFRzwd59NUHcGEJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Both phones have an AI ProVisual Engine and support generative editing features with photos. This includes features like Photo Assist that help you get the best photo result possible. Enjoy other fun and useful photo-related features as well, like Portrait Studio, so you can turn your photos into art of different styles.</p><p>Overall, there isn’t a massive difference in the cameras in these two phones. But if you post social content or tend to use the front camera often, the improvements with the Galaxy S25 FE might sway you in its direction.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-fe-vs-samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-which-should-you-buy-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 FE vs. Samsung Galaxy S24 FE: Which should you buy?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5MFLoWPjddb7oCNtfNvymM" name="S25-FE-Bezels" alt="The bezels on the Samsung Galaxy S25 FE that aren't uniform." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5MFLoWPjddb7oCNtfNvymM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It’s decision time. Between the Samsung Galaxy S25 FE vs Galaxy S24 FE, considering they both come in at around the same price, you’d best go with the newer model. If you have the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE already, however, it isn’t worth the upgrade just yet. Hang onto that phone because most of the enhancements with the Galaxy S25 FE are OS based and have either already made their way to the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE via Android 16 or One UI 8, or will in the near future.</p><p>There are moderate improvements, including the ultra-slim and sleek design, the cool new colors, faster charging, and the fact that the Samsung Galaxy S25 FE will last for two additional OS upgrades since the Galaxy S24 FE launched with Android 14. But it’s nothing earth-shattering.</p><p>Bottom line: go with the Samsung Galaxy S25 FE if you’re buying new, but stick with the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE if you already own it — or you can get one for a ridiculously killer deal. You won’t be losing out on much.

For users looking to get creative with Honor's next flagship phone, which will utilize the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chip, the post states you'll find the industry's first "Agent-powered Magic Color" system. This system takes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/honor-unveils-global-ai-strategy-with-usd-ten-billion">Honor Alpha Plan</a>, the company's previous commitment to stronger, smarter on-device AI, to a whole new level.</p><p>Honor states Magic Color pairs its on-device AI with "advanced semantic understanding" to create an easy image editing experience for everyday users and creators that embody professional edits. Through "one-sentence commands," Honor says users can transform their images, restyle them, and extract "key color tones" to be used in other places.</p><p>On a more technical side, the improved power of the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 has helped facilitate Honor's "Dual-Engine" approach to on-device AI.</p><p>The company says it's looking to solve three key issues with on-device AI: computing power, memory, and energy consumption. At the Snapdragon Summit 2025 event, Honor introduced its Low-Bit Quantization tech, a first for Android. Using Qualcomm's Hexagon NPU, this new tech boosts computing power by 15%, lowers energy consumption by 30%, and takes up 30% less storage. This Low-Bit tech is also said to speed up the rate at which its on-device AI can process and surface data.</p><h2 id="performance-the-magic-8-pro-2">Performance & the Magic 8 Pro</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:150.00%;"><img id="geQTpYJNLwYUa6KbwJtvNK" name="honor-magic-8-pro-summit-2025-teaser" alt="The Honor Magic 8 Pro in a light greenish-blue colorway, showing its rounded, centered camera array during the company's appearance at the Snapdragon Summit 2025 event." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/geQTpYJNLwYUa6KbwJtvNK.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="400" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Honor)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:150.00%;"><img id="JVVv6pJr2oVw2BATYt54PK" name="honor-magic-8-pro-summit-2025-teaser-stand" alt="The Honor Magic 8 Pro in a light greenish-blue colorway, showing its rounded, centered camera array during the company's appearance at the Snapdragon Summit 2025 event." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JVVv6pJr2oVw2BATYt54PK.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="400" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Honor)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Performance is the other side of this "Dual-Engine" approach Honor's got going on this year. When it comes to gaming, Honor says it has introduced its GPU-NPU Heterogeneous AI Super Sampling tech. What this means is that, through AI reconstruction, Honor's technology can take low frame rates and resolution and raise the bar, sort of like DLSS on a gaming PC. During its testing, Honor says this Super Sampling tech can achieve 120fps at 1080p from something that originally ran at 60fps on-device.</p><p>Fang Fei, president of products at Honor, said, "By working with leading partners such as Qualcomm Technologies to continually redefine what's possible with on-device AI, we move closer to creating an open, co-created, value-sharing world where everyone can benefit from AI."</p><p>These new AI achievements from Honor are said to arrive on its Magic 8 Pro and Magic Pad 3 Pro "next month." However, it's the company's next flagship phone that's garnering a little attention late this week. The Magic 8 Pro was there during Honor's keynote speech at Snapdragon Summit 2025, where it stunned with rounded corners, flat sides, and a seemingly flat display.</p><p>It's a design similar to what consumers received with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Magic 7 Pro</a>. The next iteration will keep its centered, rounded camera housing with a glossy ring encircling it from beneath. The device will launch in China in October. There's no word about a global launch just yet.</p> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Dbrand emailed me to brag today. The company just launched its first in-store options at Best Buy, a notable point in the company's online-only history. Now that they have the opportunity to directly compete with names like Otterbox, Spigen, and CASeTIFY, you'd think things would get a little more difficult for them.</p><p>Apparently not.</p><p>In just 48 hours, they made $1 million in phone case and screen protector sales, even eclipsing Apple's own cases that launched with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/deciding-between-iphone-17-models-as-an-android-user-heres-what-to-consider">iPhone 17</a>. Less surprisingly, its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/dbrand-killswitch-travel-kit-for-nintendo-switch-2/J89GJY738K">Killswitch Nintendo Switch 2 case</a> is now sitting at #2 for Switch 2 accessories, only sitting behind Nintendo's Pro controller.</p><p>But I shouldn't be at all surprised, and you probably aren't if you've ever used a Dbrand skin, case, or screen protector before, either. The Killswitch is by far the best Switch 2 case, and it's hard to beat the company's phone cases thanks to their epic build quality. Some of them even offer skinning capability, so you can restyle your phone without having to switch out your favorite case.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="cc89d1b1-d7dc-40a9-99ea-aff5e35fef09" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="For Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" data-dimension48="For Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/searchpage.jsp?id=pcat17071&st=dbrand" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="PU2iCLev4wbydFK5qGxhxC" name="dbrand-ghost-2-case-official-render-google-pixel-10-pro-xl" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PU2iCLev4wbydFK5qGxhxC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>Get full protection for your Google Pixel 10 Pro XL or Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra without hiding that beautiful color you spent so long deliberating over.

This one does both, with a rubberized, textured grip you're going to love. Better yet, the buttons remain clicky and separated, because we all know how awful some cases can make your phone's buttons feel.</p><p>The only downside is that the Ghost 2.0 cases aren't designed for Dbrand skins. The skins aren't sold at Best Buy, anyway, so you'll need to buy them from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://dbrand.com/">the Dbrand website</a> if you were looking for the skinnable Grip Case.</p><p>Thankfully, at least, this case has a small lip on the front side that leaves plenty of room for a screen protector, and Dbrand has you covered there with another Best Buy-available product.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="a28ee328-6d2d-4fa2-8547-6d018f0515cb" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="For Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" data-dimension48="For Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/searchpage.jsp?id=pcat17071&st=dbrand" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:900px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="jYNYbLpnW2sPFRF8ooPenF" name="dbrand-prism-2-official-render-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jYNYbLpnW2sPFRF8ooPenF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="900" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>Screen protectors are usually a pain to install, but Dbrand has figured out how to make the process completely painless with a one-step applicator.

I put one on my Nintendo Switch 2 and couldn't believe that there was no dust or anything between the massive screen and the tempered glass screen protector.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, applying the Prism 2.0 to my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/google-pixel-10" target="_blank">Google Pixel 10</a> Pro XL was just as effortless.

Prism 2.0 works with <strong>all</strong> Dbrand cases, so even if you wanted to buy a skinnable Grip case for your phone, you can still pick up a Prism screen protector at Best Buy today and keep the screen protected until your case arrives.</p> ]]></dc:content>

If you're like me, the memories of arcades are mostly relegated to childhood. If you're young enough, you may never have had the chance to experience the unique atmosphere of a 1980s neon-lit arcade, but one Meta Quest accessory is bringing that feeling right to your living room.</p><p>The slightly-difficult-to-type X-Arcade Arcade2TV-XR is an arcade stick like none I've ever used, and it's built specifically to work with everything from a PlayStation 5 to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a>. One look at it might make you think it's only for serious Street Fighter 6 tournament enthusiasts, but this black, white, and red beauty is built for so much more.</p><p>It ranks right up there with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-meta-quest-3-accessories">best Meta Quest accessories</a> for me, as it not only provides a unique experience for all types of games, but it's dead easy to setup and regularly play on. It's made me fall in love with pinball games all over again, and it's the perfect accessory <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/why-does-retro-gaming-and-emulation-matter-so-much">for emulation lovers like my co-worker, Andrew Myrick</a>.</p><h2 id="a-home-arcade-2">A home arcade</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4d7JZZEkEPrzZj3oFtytg" name="x-arcade-Arcade2TV-XR-top" alt="An X-Arcade Arcade2TV-XR cabinet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4d7JZZEkEPrzZj3oFtytg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As you might gather from the image above, the X-Arcade Arcade2TV-XR is a hefty arcade stick setup with 2-player functionality and several different input options. My unit came with an adjustable metal stand that's impressively sturdy (and very heavy), complete with wheels on the back so you can move it around without too much trouble.</p><p>The unit plugs into a custom 2-port USB plug (that only takes up one wall outlet port). It comes with both globe and bat-shaped joystick heads, a set of connectors and adapters that help make it compatible with a range of home consoles, and a clever Bluetooth adapter that plugs into a Meta Quest headset's USB-C port.</p><p>This dongle means there's <em>zero</em> configuration required to get the Arcade2TV-XR working with supported games on your VR headset. To put it simply, I did not expect this. I low-key dreaded having to set up a bunch of stuff just to get it working and was beyond surprised when I found out there wasn't any real setup required at all.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jjvfUC72ejpkjTTv5AKvJi" name="x-arcade-Arcade2TV-XR-controllers" alt="Docking a Meta Quest 3 controller into the X-Arcade Arcade2TV-XR "cabinet"" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jjvfUC72ejpkjTTv5AKvJi.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:133.35%;"><img id="CrBQvKbnTj6TePr8e3YeVi" name="x-arcade-Arcade2TV-XR-01" alt="The X-Arcade Arcade2TV-XR "cabinet"" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CrBQvKbnTj6TePr8e3YeVi.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="2731" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3UjZsto6CLQH4mgar2V2Ji" name="x-arcade-Arcade2TV-XR-buttons" alt="An up-close look at the buttons on the X-Arcade Arcade2TV-XR "cabinet"" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3UjZsto6CLQH4mgar2V2Ji.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Let's start with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/pinball-fx-vr/7255396864545733/">Pinball FX VR</a> since that was the main draw for me here, anyway. You fire up the game and find yourself in the middle of a giant pinball arcade you can virtually walk around in. The moment you fire up the game, it recognizes that you've got an X-Arcade unit. We're already off to a good start!</p><p>As I walked up to a pinball table, I got another message telling me to dock the controllers into the physical X-Arcade unit and press the side buttons simultaneously. The moment I did this, the game pulled the pinball table right up to my hip and placed my virtual hands on the flipper buttons.</p><p>As you might assume, these buttons were in the exact same spots as the physical X-Arcade unit standing in front me. I was immediately impressed because <em>it just worked</em>. If I had a dime for every time I said that about a game that needs some kind of connected accessory to work, I'd be quite poor.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VUNnsiaMMndRuJVVxLE277" name="pinball-fx-x-arcade-01" alt="Using the X-Arcade Arcade2TV-XR unit in Pinball FX VR on a Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VUNnsiaMMndRuJVVxLE277.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="cKLeUzbaLiL8C9ESkNfk67" name="pinball-fx-x-arcade-02" alt="Using the X-Arcade Arcade2TV-XR unit in Pinball FX VR on a Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cKLeUzbaLiL8C9ESkNfk67.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The next few hours saw me racking up high scores while enjoying the physical tactile feel of an arcade cabinet, all without the grunge on the buttons from years of misuse. It's so incredibly well-built it feels like it'll withstand just about anything I'd throw at it (even literally), and the buttons and joysticks are all made of the same high-quality materials you'd expect of a proper arcade cabinet.</p><p>The height adjusts so that it's comfortable for both standing and seated players, which further widens the appeal. I also <em>love</em> that it has docking stations for the left and right Meta Quest controllers, as it makes it dead easy to switch between inputs and perfectly align virtual cabinets with the physical X-Arcade unit.</p><p>I'd recommend picking up an official <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Meta-Quest-Open-Facial-Interface-Visibility/dp/B09MJQW8HC/">Meta Quest 3 open facial interface</a> if you find you really love mixed reality gaming with this. Pinball enthusiasts can even order <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://shop.xgaming.com/blogs/news/x-force-haptics-kit-august-2025-development-update">a haptic adapter set</a> that adds spring-loaded plungers, vibration motors, and more.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OGfhfHTlG4c" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>X-Arcade also makes its own app for the Meta Quest called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/arcade-ranger/5682698088461039/">Arcade Ranger</a>. A free copy of the game comes with every Arcade2TV-XR arcade stick and is designed to be your personal virtual arcade. In this app, you have an entire arcade that you can customize. You can even jump into sandbox mode and turn a completely empty room into the arcade of your dreams, or just stick to mixed reality mode and use your own physical room.</p><p>The app makes it easy to download emulator cores, but you'll need to supply your own ROMs (as expected). Just drop ROMs into a folder, tell it where to look, and it'll load things up. It works like any other emulator experience you've ever delved into.</p><p>Emulation isn't exactly my forte as it requires more configuration than I have patience for, but I was happy to see that you could also connect the arcade stick to a PC and use it as a regular X Input device, meaning it's perfect for playing anything on Steam VR if you've already got a great emulation setup on your PC.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1650px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="CsfsREEa7tSFNnqaDNEpBf" name="arcade-ranger-donkey-kong-country" alt="Playing Donkey Kong Country on a small CRT TV in Arcade Ranger on a Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CsfsREEa7tSFNnqaDNEpBf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1650" height="928" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: X-Arcade)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The obvious advantage over a physical arcade cabinet (or multiple cabinets) is that this saves a ton of space and also gives you a way to play many other types of games that wouldn't normally be supported on an arcade cabinet setup. That includes big ol' pinball tables. Heck, you can even recreate your childhood and play Donkey Kong Country on a 20-inch CRT TV within the Arcade ranger app, if that's your jam.</p><p>It's an expensive setup, no doubt, but competing emulation arcade cabinets with a physical display will cost something like 4x the price of this unit, making it a surprisingly good deal. Plus, with the ability to use it on any console or PC with a simple adapter, it's an investment that'll last a long time for any gamer that loves a good arcade stick.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="157bf72f-67c2-40a0-9ab6-53b0d5f3a472">            <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/X-Arcade-Arcade2TV-XR-Tankstick-VR-Controller-2-Player-Fightstick-Trackball-RGB-Lighting-Meta-Quest-3-Integration-Pinball-FX-Arcade-Ranger/16866671271" data-model-name="X-Arcade Arcade2TV-XR" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BLc6qgKVxmibT8DE7WeYTC.jpg' alt="An official render of the X-Arcade Arcade2TV-XR "cabinet""></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">X-Arcade Arcade2TV-XR</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Get the real feeling of an arcade cabinet in your home with the flexibility of a virtual reality arcade, all with official support for your Meta Quest headset.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

Unlike traditional tools, it doesn’t stop at static generation, meaning you can edit your board using natural language commands like “make this brighter” or “combine these two elements,” and quickly spin off variants with the “regenerate” or “more like this” options.</p><h2 id="gemini-nano-banana-the-tech-behind-the-tool-2">Gemini + Nano Banana: The tech behind the tool</h2><p>At the heart of Mixboard is Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini AI</a> model, paired with a new image editing engine called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-says-nano-banana-drove-in-over-10-million-new-users-to-gemini-app">Nano Banana</a>. This tool focuses on making subtle but powerful adjustments through text prompts rather than manual tweaking. You can also upload your own images and let the AI adapt or extend them, making Mixboard useful not only for inspiration but also for remixing existing ideas.</p><p>Google emphasizes that Mixboard is not a polished design suite like Photoshop or Canva. Instead, it is meant to be a space for brainstorming during the messy middle stage of creativity, when you are moving from a vague idea to a finished product.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="auQLcCjzQ5cz5zwdvRD94D" name="Google-Mixboard-canvas" alt="Google Mixboard showing cups, bowls and plates" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/auQLcCjzQ5cz5zwdvRD94D.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="607" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.11%;"><img id="Bopk3yVmMUdGjfFoLpfr7D" name="Google-Mixboard-canvas" alt="Google Mixboard showing a dog in different costumes" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Bopk3yVmMUdGjfFoLpfr7D.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="606" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.02%;"><img id="RdDWM2jXZ3FosvRxJvDT9D" name="Google-Mixboard-canvas" alt="Google Mixboard showing different DIY ideas for jeans embroidery" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RdDWM2jXZ3FosvRxJvDT9D.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="605" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="GzofHU78uKssWYPeDNCNvC" name="Google-Mixboard-canvas" alt="Google Mixboard" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GzofHU78uKssWYPeDNCNvC.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="607" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Google frames Mixboard as an ideation engine rather than a final design tool.

Like these platforms, Mixboard offers a visually focused, collaborative experience, but it stands out by including generative AI from the beginning.</p><p>This blend of AI and visual boards turns Mixboard into a design canvas that reacts to your ideas in real time. The app is especially approachable for non-designers, since AI lowers the barrier to producing mood boards and creative drafts without specialized skills.</p><p>For now, Mixboard is a work in progress. It’s an experiment with rough edges. But its debut signals a broader move from Google to push AI beyond text and search, into tools that reflect how people actually brainstorm and think visually.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Think of it as an upgrade to the current Google Lens, and Google's way of pushing Gemini's multimodal capabilities onto more platforms.</p><p>With "Live Search," users can have real-time, interactive conversations with Google Search in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://search.google/ways-to-search/ai-mode/" target="_blank">AI Mode</a>, much like speaking to the AI chatbot on Gemini Live. This feature allows users to share their phone's camera feed, and they will have the ability to respond to your questions in real time. Since this feature is tied to AI Mode, it will also provide links for intensive research as well.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5oa-TzWXE8k" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>For instance, you'd like to know how you can make a cup of matcha — all users have to do is open the Google app (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox&hl=en_US&pli=1" target="_blank">Android</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google/id284815942" target="_blank">iOS</a>) and tap the new "Live" icon under the search bar. Then point the camera at the equipment in your matcha set and ask what each tool is used for. Or you could even ask it questions for a deeper understanding of matcha's history or its rise to fame as a beverage.</p><p>It can also come in handy when you're on vacation and want to have a hands-free conversation with someone about the best spots around the neighborhood to explore. Users can even use the Live option on the go to help them translate or give them more information on anything they see. It's practically a personal assistant in your pocket that can help you with quick fixes or if you need help with an assignment.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C5dH2iqt0wY" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Google says that users can start asking questions out loud and enable video input to share visual context from their camera feed. This feature extends into  Google Lens as well. Now, you can go a step further and click on the Live option within Lens to have an instant back-and-forth conversation about whatever you see in front of you, instead of clicking a picture and waiting for Google Lens to do its job.</p><p>The Live Search option is available to all Android and iOS users in the U.S. starting Sept. 24. Accessing this feature appears significantly easier within the Google app itself, as opposed to navigating to Gemini, then selecting Gemini Live, and finally activating your camera.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Beginning this week, once you've downloaded the patch, users receiving messages in another language can long-press that text and tap the new "Translate" button. WhatsApp states users will have to choose the language  the message should be translated "from or to, and download it to be saved for future translations."</p><p>The post stresses the privacy side of WhatsApp, informing users that whatever is translated is done on your device, adding that the service "cannot see them."</p><p>Once this patch hits Android, WhatsApp says those users can enable automatic translations for an entire chat, so everything is converted without your manual input. More importantly, this update brings translation support to Android for six languages: English, Spanish, Hindi, Portuguese, Russian, and Arabic. Those on iPhone will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apple.com/ios/feature-availability/#translate-translate-app">receive support</a> for over 19 languages to start.</p><p>As this update makes its rounds, WhatsApp states you can activate message translation in one-on-one chats, groups, and Channel updates.</p><h2 id="whatsapp-rolls-on-2">WhatsApp rolls on</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="3MLW4pP4msh72zT9ah2AGi" name="WhatsApp-logo.jpg" alt="WhatsApp logo on a phone screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3MLW4pP4msh72zT9ah2AGi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There have been some notable WhatsApp updates so far, as during the summer, the platform <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/whatsapp-unread-texts-message-summaries-meta-ai-rollout">rolled out message summaries</a>.

The switch to a fully-custom design — made possible with the Nuvia acquisition — gave Qualcomm a distinct advantage, and it's making effective use of that this year.</p><p>Awkward naming aside, the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 delivers considerable upgrades to last year, with Qualcomm touting a huge 20% increase in CPU performance, while somehow simultaneously hitting 35% better efficiency. It's clear that Qualcomm set out to establish itself as the dominant chip vendor with the introduction of the platform, and early benchmarking tests indicate just how much of a lead the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 has this year over devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x200-ultra-review">Vivo X200 Ultra</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> models.</p><p>My colleague Derrek Lee is at the annual Snapdragon Summit in Hawaii, and he was able to use a Qualcomm reference device powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 to run synthetic benchmarks.</p><h2 id="snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5-domineering-cpu-performance-2">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5: Domineering CPU performance</h2><p>Let's start with Geekbench; the utility does a good job emulating real-world usage scenarios, and it's a decent predictor of how fast a chipset is. Qualcomm and MediaTek always did well in this area when they used standard Arm cores, but Apple came in and took the overall lead by leveraging a custom design. That's why A series silicon dominated Geekbench charts for the better part of the last six years.</p><p>With the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, Qualcomm is once again asserting its dominance. The chipset managed to get 12,170 in Geekbench's multi-core tests, and that's wild — that's at least 15% better than anything else available today. Even the latest A19 Pro silicon only goes up to 10,500, signaling the gulf that exists between Qualcomm and the rest of the field.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Qualcomm reference device</p></th><th  ><p>Redmagic 10S Pro</p></th><th  ><p>Vivo X200 Pro</p></th><th  ><p>Pixel 10 Pro XL</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Geekbench 6 (single-core)</p></td><td  ><p>3,832</p></td><td  ><p>3,133</p></td><td  ><p>2381</p></td><td  ><p>2288</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Geekbench 6 (multi-core)</p></td><td  ><p>12,170</p></td><td  ><p>9,479</p></td><td  ><p>7175</p></td><td  ><p>6030</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>It's a similar story with single-core results as well. With a result of 3,832 in Geekbench 6, Qualcomm is showing that it's able to hold onto the lead in this category. Qualcomm isn't going into too much detail about the internals of the Oryon cores and the underlying architecture, but seeing as how it underpins the chip vendor's computing efforts — both on mobile and PC — it's evident just how much of an impact a custom design has. That's not a new thing; Apple has shown time and again that it's able to deliver in this area, both with the A series silicon and its M range of chipsets that it uses on MacBooks and iPads.</p><p>With Qualcomm doubling down on its custom design, it has an outsized lead in the context of Android phones. MediaTek's Dimensity, Google Tensor, and Samsung Exynos all use regular Arm cores, and while they're great in their own right — I'm excited to see what Arm's C1 Ultra and C1 Pro manage to offer with the Dimensity 9400 — but it's likely that the gains won't be as high as what Qualcomm is delivering this year.</p><h2 id="snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5-adreno-blazes-ahead-2">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5: Adreno blazes ahead</h2><p>Qualcomm is making decent inroads with the Adreno GPU as well, touting 23% improved performance alongside 20%better efficiency. We usually see these kinds of gains when a chip vendor moves to a new node, but Qualcomm is using the same 3nm TSMC node as last year, making the improvements all the more impressive.</p><p>Another interesting highlight is that Qualcomm now offers Unreal Engine 5 integration with its mobile chipset, making it easier to get console-quality games on Android. This has been an area where Apple had a distinct advantage thanks to its vertical integration, and Qualcomm is aiming to address that. We'll have to wait and see if it leads to any meaningful change when it comes to Android gaming — I'm yet to play a decent title with ray tracing — but Qualcomm is putting in the legwork.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Qualcomm reference device</p></th><th  ><p>Redmagic 10S Pro</p></th><th  ><p>Vivo X200 Pro</p></th><th  ><p>Pixel 10 Pro XL</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>3DMark Wild Life Extreme (score)</p></td><td  ><p>8,393</p></td><td  ><p>6,954</p></td><td  ><p>6,070</p></td><td  ><p>3,182</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>3DMark Wild Life Extreme (FPS)</p></td><td  ><p>50.26</p></td><td  ><p>41.64</p></td><td  ><p>36.35</p></td><td  ><p>19.05</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>3DMark's Wild Like Extreme showcases the gains on offer this year. While these benchmarks aren't indicative of real-world use, they allow us to see how much things change year-on-year, and the results showcase the potential of the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5. We are coming to a point where it isn't the hardware, but the quality of the games that's the bottleneck on Android.</p><p>I'm excited to get my hands on devices powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5. Phone manufacturers don't tend to wait too long before releasing devices, with Xiaomi, Realme, and Honor slated to roll out phones featuring Qualcomm's latest silicon in the coming weeks. With the Dimensity 9500-powered OPPO Find X9 Pro also debuting globally soon, we don't have to wait too long to see how Qualcomm and MediaTek's chipsets hold up in real-world scenarios. Until then, Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 benchmarks suggest next year's flagships should be highly interesting.</p> ]]></dc:content>

All price hikes are said to go into effect on October 21. Both of the standalone Disney Plus plans are going up, moving from $9.99 to $11.99 for its basic with ads plans and $15.99 to $18.99 for its Premium (no ads) version.</p><p>When we get to the Disney Plus, Hulu, HBO Max bundles, those are set to go up, too. The support page states that the bundle with ads, currently for $16.99 a month, will rise to $19.99 per month on October 21. This hike extends to the no-ads version, going from $29.99 per month to $32.99.</p><p>The final major bundle, the one with Disney Plus, Hulu, and ESPN, isn't getting a price hike <em>everywhere</em>, but there are still changes consumers should know. Disney isn't increasing the monthly charge for its "Disney Plus, Hulu Bundle Premium," "Disney Plus, Hulu, ESPN Unlimited Bundle," or the "Disney Plus, Hulu, ESPN Unlimited Bundle Premium."</p><p>Price hikes will fall into the following bundles:</p><ul><li>Disney Plus, Hulu Bundle (with ads): $10.99 to $12.99</li><li>Disney Plus, Hulu, ESPN Select Bundle (with ads): $16.99 to $19.99</li><li>Disney Plus, Hulu, ESPN Select Bundle Premium (no ads): $26.99 to $29.99</li><li>Disney Plus Premium, Hulu, ESPN Select Bundle Legacy (no ads on Disney): $21.99 to $24.99</li></ul><h2 id="oh-yet-again-2">Oh, yet again...</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1820px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.65%;"><img id="ywMwrtVA9zjgedHwenqeHF" name="disney-plus-logo.jpg" alt="Disney+ logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ywMwrtVA9zjgedHwenqeHF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1820" height="1213" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Disney+)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The publication shed some light on a report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/783489/disney-plus-streaming-subscription-price-increase">The Verge</a> regarding this Disney Plus price hike. The post highlights Marisa Kaba (journalist) on Bluesky, who had an alleged inside scoop about this, and it seems the recent removal of Jimmy Kimmel Live!, which has since returned to ABC, caused the service to drop subscribers at an incredible rate. Moreover, Kaba reports that Disney and ABC moved to quickly bring the late-night show back because of this planned price hike.</p><p>Kaba adds, "With subscriptions hemorrhaging since last week, they couldn’t risk losing more users with this announcement."</p><p>Unfortunately, this isn't the first time Disney Plus subscribers have gone <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/the-disney-plus-price-increase-goes-into-effect-this-week-heres-how-to-keep-your-current-rate">through this price hike scenario</a>, and it's all feeling like a time loop by this point. The service raised prices in December 2022 for its Premium plans, Legacy bundles, and other Hulu, ESPN bundles. Fast-forward to 2023 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/disney-plus-hulu-are-raising-prices-again">the service raised prices</a>—again—for its bundles and other ad-free plans.</p><p>The only thing consistent, other than the fact that the past few years have had price hikes, is that Disney tends to do them late in the year, between October and December. While these hikes have been confirmed on its support page, the service is sure to begin emailing users or informing you in the app about how the hikes will affect your specific plan.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It's designed for capturing professional-quality video that's perceptually (not really) lossless on a device as small as a smartphone. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s26-could-challenge-iphone-with-pro-grade-video-tools">As rumored</a>, it is supported by the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/rumored-snapdragon-8-elite-name-change-confusing">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> chip and ready for prime time.</p><p>As a "pro" video codec, it's pretty light on resources. It has very efficient compression (meaning it shrinks files in a smart way that looks good) while not needing much computational power. That makes it perfect for a phone with inherently low computational power because of size and temperature restraints.</p><p>On the feature side, the codec carries <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-hdr">HDR 10/10+ metadata</a>, supports up to 8K video with high-bandwidth processing (it's fast), and is optimized for multi-CPU and GPU devices.

You just answered the question.</p><p>A big deal will be made about this, just as it was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.apple.com/en-la/106396" target="_blank">when Apple did it</a>. That's because it is a big deal and a darn marvel of software engineering. It just has a very limited user base.</p><p>Regardless of what device manufacturers try to tell you, professional, commercial-grade video is not <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-video-recording-upgrade">taken by people using a phone</a>. You may find a few clips mixed into something that <em>are</em> phone video, but a "cheap" device like even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">the best phone</a> simply can't compare to a proper video camera. A codec doesn't change or dictate that. Physics does.</p><p>Having said that, most of us know "that guy." You might even be that guy — the person who makes taking videos with his or her phone more than a hobby and really geeks out over it all. This is for that guy, and it's an awesome feature.</p><p>Now we don't know how this works in real life just yet, and I'm going to assume everything will go as planned, and using APV won't make phones overheat or kill a battery in 12 minutes. You know, the optimistic route.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="SPZiqduU9qWPUXB9Jcd65n" name="Snapdragon-logo-water" alt="The Snapdragon logo sitting above water in a pool next to the ocean in Maui" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SPZiqduU9qWPUXB9Jcd65n.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The "prosumer" phone camera enthusiast knows they won't see a world of difference visually. This doesn't change how the video looks, per se, just how efficiently it can be captured and worked with later. For that, this should be a treat, and the end result may very well look better because of it.</p><p>Videos captured should be able to retain more information, which means the editing software has more data to work with. A video editing app is like Google or Amazon and loves having a mountain of data to sort through. An efficient, "lossless", high-bandwidth capture codec means the editing process can spend more time on tweaking the visuals and have more picture information to use while doing it.</p><p>This will make a difference, but only if you're "that guy" and know how and why you want to use it.</p><p>So far, APV support is limited to only Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 (my god these names) powered devices. More information about phones sporting the latest chip will be coming, and it's possible that support will carry down to Qualcomm's more mid-range Snapdragon chips sometime in the future.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Despite having many cool, affordable, and customizable Android smartwatches available, iPhone owners have been largely limited to Apple Watches, as other brands have struggled to match the same level of compatibility. But that could be changing soon.</p><p>Apple seems to be making these changes under the hood, as a recent deep dive into iOS 26.1's beta code, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2917201/ios-26-1-beta-suggests-the-iphone-will-soon-support-third-party-smartwatches.html">Macworld</a> appears to have spotted notification support for third-party smartwatches. The website noted that the latest iOS beta code showed up with an unreleased "Notification Forwarding" feature, which allows iPhone users to pick a third-party device/ accessory other than the iPhone to show their notifications on.</p><p>But here's the catch: within the strings of the code, there's a restriction on this feature that suggests that notifications can only be forwarded to “one accessory at a time,” which means that you'd have to disable notifications on your Apple Watch in case you want to see them on your third-party accessory, which is what most people would do if they own two watches.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fMN3H8jBZ2phCEXWxyMuuN" name="Apple Watch Series 10" alt="Apple Watch Series 10" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fMN3H8jBZ2phCEXWxyMuuN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The website adds that the beta has references to new abilities concerning accessory pairing, including one called “AccessoryExtension.” This again hints at third-party device pairing, which seems to be in the initial stages of development.</p><p>That said, there's little to no information on whether this feature would roll out globally or would be restricted to certain regions. However, it is highly likely that this feature could come to the EU region first, considering the DMA (Digital Markets Act) basically <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/eu-dma-ruling-could-completely-reshape-fitness-smartwatch-industry">forced Apple</a> to make exclusive Apple Watch features available on third-party watches. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/competition/digital_markets_act/cases/202512/DMA_100203_1536.pdf" target="_blank">DMA decision on March 19</a> lists out how Apple must provide "effective interoperability" to let any connected device "receive, access, use, respond to, and transmit iOS notifications as well as to select and manage which notifications are displayed."</p><p>Apple's upcoming iOS update, expected in October, will likely introduce this feature that extends basic notification support to all third-party smartwatches — including devices like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-hands-on">Samsung's Galaxy Watch</a> and other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android smartwatches</a> out there, but it may not work as seamlessly as an Apple Watch would with an iPhone. So that's still a bargain that users should be willing to make.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="d9b17cd0-9cab-415f-84d3-adeb33293d89">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EsJNwXE22phiafcE9ZTFKA.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                    <span class='featured__label horizontal__label'>Bold swing</span>                                                            <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The Galaxy Watch 8 Classic offers Watch 6 Classic owners a faster, efficient Exynos processor, new health sensors with perks like Antioxidant Index and Vascular Load, dual-band GPS, doubled storage, and a blazing 3,000 nits of brightness.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

The inside of the app sports larger design changes, such as the vertical, pill-shaped row of key Pixel Watch features. The update places Fitbit, Personal Safety, Gemini, and Google Wallet right above your device's illustration.</p><p>Beneath that illustration, users will find their connectivity info, battery percentage, and the last time the watch has synced with Fitbit's services.</p><p>The clean containers for UI elements that Google has implemented across Android are present in the updated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-watch-app-play-store">Pixel Watch app</a>, too. As part of the "main" feature set, users will find Watch Faces and Tiles before scrolling down into their Settings. These new containers and subtle line separators are present throughout the entire app, as well, especially when scrolling through your tiles and other sub-menus.</p><p>The Pixel Watch app icon has been updated in this update (don't be alarmed).

M3 Expressive delivered a bold redesign to watches, offering new visuals and much smoother animations across the board. One major note to mention is that M3 Expressive hugs those circular curves on the Pixel Watch, making the experience seem fuller and more immersive everywhere you go.</p><p>Aside from the new design, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a> was just a massive upgrade over the previous iteration.

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I like what Xiaomi is doing with its T series devices; the Chinese brand has consistently delivered performant phones that don't cost as much as its flagship Xiaomi 15. While these phones started out as mid-range devices, that is no longer the case in 2025, with the Xiaomi 15T and 15T Pro inching closer to flagships than traditional mid-range phones.</p><p>The upside is that Xiaomi now offers an all-round package; the 15T Pro has a sleek design that I prefer to the Xiaomi 15 and its rivals like the Vivo X200, the phone has cameras that are just as good in most situations, and the large battery ensures it lasts a day without breaking a sweat. It doesn't miss out on ingress protection either, and it even gets Xiaomi's 50W wireless charging tech in addition to regular 90W charging.</p><p>Essentially, the 15T Pro is the phone you buy if you don't need the absolute best cameras and want to save a few hundred dollars. The only drawback is that the phone doesn't have Android 16 out of the box, and Xiaomi is obstinate about not changing long-standing issues with the software. Still, if you don't mind the older software and want something that doesn't cost as much as true flagships, the 15T Pro has plenty to like.</p><h2 id="xiaomi-15t-pro-pricing-and-availability-2">Xiaomi 15T Pro: Pricing and availability</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="mwSgWgweTWLxn2eXNWvkxA" name="Xiaomi 15T Pro" alt="Xiaomi 15T Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mwSgWgweTWLxn2eXNWvkxA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Xiaomi unveiled the 15T and 15T Pro globally at a launch event in Munich on September 24, and both phones are going on sale in the coming weeks.

The wide-angle module continues to be the weakest sensor, and while it doesn't measure up in low-light, it's decent in other situations.

But what's particularly annoying is that Xiaomi still doesn't offer Android 16 out of the box; both the 15T and 15T Pro run Android 15 as standard, and there's no telling when either device will switch to the latest version of Android.</p><p>To put this into context, Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 7 launched three months ago with Android 16 out of the box. Yes, that is a significantly costlier device, but Android 16 has been available for over a quarter now, and not including it out of the box is nothing short of negligence. While I've largely enjoyed what Xiaomi is doing with the hardware and cameras on its phones, its software is among the worst of any Android brand, and there's a feeling that Xiaomi doesn't want to change that.</p><p>As a result, you're once again left with an older version of Android on a brand-new device, and the interface should be familiar if you've used a Xiaomi phone in the past. It is fluid and doesn't have much in the way of issues, but it just isn't exciting to use; Xiaomi has to do a better job in this area, because it's not only behind Google and Samsung, but also OPPO and Vivo.</p><h2 id="xiaomi-15t-pro-the-alternatives-2">Xiaomi 15T Pro: The alternatives</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="z8HbCAz4dXgnQR3uQFhnma" name="iqoo-13-16.jpg" alt="iQOO 13 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/z8HbCAz4dXgnQR3uQFhnma.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Pixel 10 is a good alternative to the 15T Pro, and while it doesn't quite have versatile cameras, that's about the only major downside.

The bigger panel is great to use, the internals are among the best around, and the battery life is solid.</p><p>The only problem is around the software; Xiaomi's reluctance to address these issues and continue rolling out phones with older versions of Android is becoming a real issue. In a sense, Xiaomi is like Honor in this regard, with both brands refusing to acknowledge lingering issues with their software. Meanwhile, OPPO and Vivo are doing a great job introducing new features and modernizing their skins, and I can't help but feel that Xiaomi is being left behind.</p><p>If you're willing to overlook the fact that the 15T Pro doesn't have the latest version of Android, then you should get it — the hardware is among the best in its category.</p> ]]></dc:content>

There are two major updates Google is reportedly testing, one of which involves a more smartphone-friendly (one-handed) rework. According to the publication, this rework involves the Docs app's formatting tool. Google has been spotted moving this tool down to the bottom of the app's UI, in the toolbar that typically houses the bold, italics, bullet point, and other options.</p><p>The post even highlights an alert that Google could deliver once this update arrives, which draws attention to the formatting tool's new home.</p><p>The bottom bar is also getting a small, but useful, change. In conjunction with the tipster AssembleDebug, the post states that the toolbar at the bottom of a Doc on Android could be "horizontally scrollable."</p><p>Another more noteworthy update spotted in testing concerns new filters in Docs for Android. These filters can be applied to searches in the app, and include filters for file type, people (file owner), and modified (when it was last changed). Filtering your content by type will surface any stored documents, presentations, and spreadsheets.</p><h2 id="2"></h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:269px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:223.05%;"><img id="NLeNdqygGUU3gbukBozUHB" name="google-docs-android-formatting-tool-moved-better-use" alt="Google Docs on Android is supposedly testing a new home for its formatting tool, which could place it at the bottom for better/easier smartphone use." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NLeNdqygGUU3gbukBozUHB.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="269" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:266px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:225.56%;"><img id="F9WCeoT633nmp9GUxbCxGB" name="google-docs-android-filters-spotted-testing" alt="Google has been spotted testing a new array of filters for its Docs app on Android, such as "type," "people," and "modified."" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/F9WCeoT633nmp9GUxbCxGB.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="266" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Bringing all this together is Google's Material 3 Expressive design language, which the tipster states has been spotted in the test.

The new feature, called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/notebooklm-audio-overviews-radio-like-ai">Audio Overviews</a>, doesn’t simply read web pages word for word. Instead, it uses Google’s AI to condense the content and present it as a lively conversation between two digital hosts.</p><p>The latest stable Chrome for Android update (version 140.0.7339.124) quietly packs a new AI audio tool, first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-chrome-android-audio-overviews-rollout-3599751/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>’s Mishaal Rahman. It turns webpage text into a lively, podcast-style summary.</p><p>Using two separate AI voices, the feature presents articles as a back-and-forth conversation, making content clearer and more accessible than a standard monotone read-aloud.</p><h2 id="it-s-a-conversation-not-a-monotone-2">It's a conversation, not a monotone</h2><p>Rather than reading the whole article, the tool serves up a quick, podcast-style chat that hits the main points. This is a step up from basic text-to-speech, and it borrows heavily from Google’s NotebookLM and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/gemini">Gemini</a> projects, where Audio Overviews first appeared before making their way into Chrome.</p><p>To give it a try (assuming your device has it), open any webpage you’d like summarized, tap the three-dot menu, and select “Listen to this page.” In the playback controls, you’ll now see an option to switch to the Audio Overview mode instead of the standard read-aloud.</p><p>It’s built to be way more interesting than a flat, monotone voice droning through a webpage.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:389px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:222.11%;"><img id="n8nqCznvxbDWcMgK89qHWh" name="Chrome-on-Android-Audio-Overviews" alt="Audio Overviews generating AI playback on Chrome for Android" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n8nqCznvxbDWcMgK89qHWh.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="389" height="864" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:389px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:222.11%;"><img id="5iySHJ3GknaAyMEav8GWUh" name="Chrome-on-Android-Audio-Overviews" alt="Audio Overviews generating AI playback on Chrome for Android" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5iySHJ3GknaAyMEav8GWUh.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="389" height="864" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The feature is rolling out in stages, so even with the right version of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-browsers">web browser</a>, you might not see it right away. Google uses this approach to catch and fix any hiccups before pushing it to everyone.</p><h2 id="best-for-long-reads-2">Best for long reads</h2><p>Once it’s available to you, this feature is most useful for long or information-packed articles where a fast summary saves time. Shorter pieces work fine with the standard read-aloud, but the conversational style is ideal when you’re busy or just want to give your eyes a break.</p><p>Beyond convenience, Google’s rollout of Audio Overviews to Chrome is a reminder that the web doesn’t have to be a wall of text. By turning articles into audio, it’s helping out folks with visual impairments and anyone who’d rather listen on the go or just can’t be bothered to read another endless scroll.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The imagery shows off the alleged phone from the side, with glimpses at its display and camera array. The leak suggests the Edge 70 will sport a flat display with rounded corners, a design choice that's become commonplace in the industry.</p><p>The image is also pushing the idea that the phone will be thin, stating, "impossibly thin and incredibly tough."</p><p>When we get to the rear panel, the camera array is slightly different from what we've seen Motorola provide this year with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-edge-2025-vs-edge-2024">Moto Edge 2025 (Edge 60)</a> and even the Edge 2024 (Edge 50). Instead of being nestled against the top left corner, the camera array takes space a little further into the back panel, leaving space between it and the side. It seems the Edge 70 could sport three cameras on its slightly raised array.</p><p>Additionally, Motorola could have some colored accents inbound for the phone. The alleged promo material shows the camera could be raised off the array, kind of like what you'd <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-vs-galaxy-s25-ultra">find with Samsung</a>. Those raised lenses could have colored rings around them.</p><h2 id="the-rumors-have-changed-2">The rumors have... changed?</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Boom. pic.twitter.com/zwX9cYJyNp<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1970146975820796289">September 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>We started hearing about Motorola's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/moto-edge-70-leaks-reveal-familiar-design-and-potential-specs">next Edge series model</a> back in May. Back then, the rumors were different, as posts claimed the device would remain similar to what we've seen this year with the Edge 60 and with the Edge 50 in 2024. Rumors claimed Motorola was sticking to its curved-edge display and a camera system positioned in the corner on the back of the phone.</p><p>The alleged renderings back then pointed toward as much, while also showing off lenses that were flush to its array, not lifted like we've seen rumored today.</p><p>It's difficult to tell which way we're going, especially since rumors now conflict. As far as launch goes, nothing's really certain. Older rumors claimed we would see it this month, perhaps around September 24. That's only a day away, and Motorola hasn't exactly hyped up a new Edge recently. So, we'll have to wait and see.</p><p>There were a few more rumors mentioned in those older leaks, such as the Edge 70 may rock <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-7200-launch">MediaTek's Dimensity 7000 SoC</a> and 12GB of RAM. The Edge's predecessor featured a 50MP primary, a 10MP telephoto, and a 50MP ultrawide lens, so speculation says we could see something close to this again.</p> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Sharge is a Chinese accessory manufacturer that likes to push the boundaries of design. Its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/sharge-shargeek-170-power-bank-review">Sharge 170 power bank</a> has a uniquely aggressive style, and it manages to turn heads whenever I travel with it. The brand branched out into SSD enclosures earlier this year with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/sharge-disk-review">Disk</a>, which is basically a housing designed to slot in an M.2 2230 drive.</p><p>The Disk Pro is the natural evolution of that product. The product is an external SSD that doesn't look anything like its rivals; I recently tested the Neil Poulton-designed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/lacie-rugged-ssd4-4tb-ssd-review">LaCie Rugged SSD4</a>, and while that drive stands out because of the vibrant silicone shell, the Disk Pro is in an entirely different league.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4805px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.34%;"><img id="e8EgJsKANeKAZYiKovZah5" name="Sharge Disk Pro" alt="Sharge Disk Pro external SSD review by Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e8EgJsKANeKAZYiKovZah5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4805" height="2707" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Thinking of the Disk Pro as another external SSD is reductive, as it manages to be so much more than that. Yes, it has 1TB of storage and a built-in USB-C cable that makes connecting to phones and tablets highly convenient, but you also get active cooling in the way of an integrated fan. The biggest highlight is that the SSD gets an HDMI port alongside two USB-A ports, turning it into a portable dock. Oh, and did I mention it has magnets at the back that lets you attach it to the back of your phone?</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5054px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="fMPd8bZDCqZtiDoQG5X8G5" name="Sharge Disk Pro" alt="Sharge Disk Pro external SSD review by Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fMPd8bZDCqZtiDoQG5X8G5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5054" height="2847" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Essentially, this is an external SSD and a dock all turned into one. The Disk Pro <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/shargetech/disk-pro">just debuted on Kickstarter</a>, and it costs $189 for the 1TB model that I'm using. There's also a 2TB model that costs $289, and a 4TB variant that costs $469.</p><p>Obviously, design is a key talking point with the Disk Pro; Sharge once again managed to deliver a product that stands out visually. The external SSD has a see-through design with bright accents and a yellow USB-C cable that's integrated into the chassis, and it looks cool.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="48gk4XaXVMmHo6N3aGeET5" name="Sharge Disk Pro" alt="Sharge Disk Pro external SSD review by Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/48gk4XaXVMmHo6N3aGeET5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's a physical button on the SSD to toggle the drive; this is useful if you just want to use the Disk Pro as a dock instead of needing the storage. The built-in fan only activates when needed, but the dedicated button lets you enable turbo mode, allowing it to run constantly.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4916px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="gTUtKtP64oCyvdtXqb7Va5" name="Sharge Disk Pro" alt="Sharge Disk Pro external SSD review by Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gTUtKtP64oCyvdtXqb7Va5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4916" height="2769" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Disk Pro isn't that much bigger than a regular external SSD, and the versatility that you're getting is unmatched. While it may not be that useful when connected to a phone, the real potential of the Disk Pro is with handheld gaming consoles. The ability to increase the storage while having the flexibility to connect to a keyboard and mouse and plug into a monitor or TV via HDMI — all from the same device — is just great, and the Disk Pro shines in this regard.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5052px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="wqJp9KWxGH7BhNiimpibY5" name="Sharge Disk Pro" alt="Sharge Disk Pro external SSD review by Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wqJp9KWxGH7BhNiimpibY5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5052" height="2846" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As an external SSD, it doesn't get anywhere as fast as its rivals; bandwidth is limited to a maximum of 1000MB/s, and that's less than a third of what the Rugged SSD4 and other external drives manage. That said, the transfers are more than adequate in the context of moving data around, and I didn't see any problems with this when using the Disk Pro with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/with-the-pixel-10-pro-xl-google-finally-made-a-faultless-flagship">Pixel 10 Pro XL</a> and Galaxy Z Fold 7.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="hNfY8pr3EQhGyCZYRr2S75" name="Sharge Disk Pro" alt="Sharge Disk Pro external SSD review by Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hNfY8pr3EQhGyCZYRr2S75.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I got the 1TB model of the Disk Pro, but you can get it with up to 4TB of storage, giving you the ability to significantly boost the built-in storage of your phone or handheld console. Another differentiator is the magnets; the ability to securely attach the SSD to a phone makes it all the more convenient while traveling, and this is a big win.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5112px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="7xndzxCoYPheQTmWfucDT5" name="Sharge Disk Pro" alt="Sharge Disk Pro external SSD review by Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7xndzxCoYPheQTmWfucDT5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5112" height="2879" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On the whole, I like what Sharge did with the Disk Pro; the product is marketed as a portable SSD, but it also doubles as a dock if you need it, and the built-in cooling ensures it doesn't overheat. I used it for the better part of two weeks, and overheating wasn't a problem whatsoever. If you want an all-in-one device with storage and USB ports, the Disk Pro is a good choice to consider.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Finding the ways AI can help your workflows or improve your daily life can be difficult, especially without compromising quality.</p><p>I've found that AI chatbots like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/i-havent-used-chatgpt-since-2023-heres-why-gemini-is-all-the-ai-i-need">Gemini or ChatGPT</a> are excellent at lending a hand when you have a specific problem that requires personalized context. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/how-gemini-live-video-support-helped-me-grow-plants-in-the-desert">Gemini first helped me tend to my plants</a> earlier this year; I <em>could've</em> used a search engine for ideas, but none would've been able to take the real-world appearance of the plants into account.</p><p>For those without a green thumb, I discovered yet another use case for mobile AI while struggling to come up with a design layout for my apartment. After a year of moving things around, buying new furniture, and reading unhelpful articles online, I finally pulled out my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> in a moment of frustration and turned to Gemini for help. I didn't expect much, but was blown away by what Google AI came up with.</p><p>Here's how I used AI to solve a complicated interior design issue, and how you can use it to help with your own problems too.</p><h2 id="giving-gemini-the-right-starting-point-2">Giving Gemini the right starting point</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XP5RZLwopKsQ5uQJYPBKd4" name="Gemini-Interior-Design-4" alt="Gemini chats showing interior design tips on a Google Pixel 9 Pro XL." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XP5RZLwopKsQ5uQJYPBKd4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The problem with my apartment is simple: it's fairly large, but there's only one window in the living room, kitchen, and dining area. The window is actually a sliding glass door, and is flanked by perpendicular walls with double doors, which limits furniture placement. With one natural light source, the wrong layout could make this long and relatively narrow living space feel dark and bland — that's why I needed to turn to AI.</p><p>AI is worst when you don't point it in the right direction, and best when you provide it with ample context and thorough prompts. Instead of giving Gemini a vague and generic prompt, I found the exact floor plan for my space for context and clearly stated my goals. The prompt doesn't have to be lengthy, but it does need to be thoughtful and specific.</p><p>In this case, after providing the floor plan, I asked Gemini how to lay out the living room to get the most lighting.</p><h2 id="gemini-s-personalized-and-specific-help-2">Gemini's personalized and specific help</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JHvQJN4gDdXnL9GiNrTB85" name="Gemini-Interior-Design-2" alt="Gemini chats showing interior design tips on a Google Pixel 9 Pro XL." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JHvQJN4gDdXnL9GiNrTB85.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Gemini quickly responded with some general tips, like avoiding blocking the light source, using reflective surfaces, and choosing light colors. These were helpful in their own right, but giving Gemini an understanding of the floor plan returned personalized results. The chatbot understood that "the living room is a central, long space with a large window at the end."</p><p>It sounds simple, but Gemini having a basic understanding of the layout already gave it a massive advantage over search engines or interior design websites. As an example of how, one of the sites I read suggested renovating the room to change the positions of windows and doors, which was laughably unhelpful for a renter.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Cd5XopdBBz8xwzr9yqNfe4" name="Gemini-Interior-Design-1" alt="Gemini chats showing interior design tips on a Google Pixel 9 Pro XL." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Cd5XopdBBz8xwzr9yqNfe4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> provided three detailed suggestions, and I went with the "open flow" layout. This involves floating a couch in the middle, facing the glass door, creating an open concept in the room. To avoid moving stuff around like a madman, I asked Gemini to come up with a few examples of what this would look like in my space — another thing I couldn't have done without AI.</p><p>The other cool thing about using AI for problem-solving and brainstorming is that you can ask further questions as you go. If you have essential needs, like a TV in a certain spot, Gemini can take that into account and only provide solutions that meet this requirement.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7pVfTUBXvNjgzr59fnAiW4" name="Gemini-Mirror-Tips" alt="Gemini chats showing interior design tips on a Google Pixel 9 Pro XL." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7pVfTUBXvNjgzr59fnAiW4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>AI also suggested ideas and solutions that never even crossed my mind — like using mirrors around the room to simulate more windows and natural light in the space.

If you don't provide an AI chatbot with ample context, it only has its training material to go off of, which can lead to unhelpful results. You can go about providing context in a few ways, such as providing AI photos or screenshots, like I did with my apartment's floor plan. Or, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/gemini-live-real-time-screen-sharing-now-available-to-all-android-users">use features like Gemini Live that share your surroundings</a> via your phone's camera, which are other ways to provide context.</p><p>From there, be sure to write a thorough prompt that clearly explains your goals and what you need AI to do. You should use complete sentences for the best results, but avoid writing long paragraphs. Lastly, don't forget that you can refine your prompts as you go and steer the AI chatbot in the right direction. This can help if at first the AI doesn't provide the results you're expecting from your prompt.</p><p>With these factors in mind, you can get AI to help you with almost anything, whether it's gardening or interior design — or something else completely.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="ebfc553d-203e-4065-b563-014c5363285a">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/roHfB8CwZvHJScuZ8TL6Bf.jpg' alt="Google Pixel 10"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 10</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The best AI phone</strong></em></p><p>While plenty of phones can use the Gemini app, the Google Pixel 10 is the best one on the market for Google AI. </p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

However, there's something to be said about using earbuds by audio-first companies like Sony or Bose. In particular, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-earbuds-review">Bose's QuietComfort Ultra earbuds</a> were known for delivering premium sound and active noise-canceling (ANC) on the go.</p><p>Now, Bose is here with a second-generation revision of the QuietComfort Ultra earbuds, and they're even better. I've spent about a month testing them against all the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">best earbuds</a>, including new releases like AirPods Pro 3. They've come with me on runs, international flights, and everything in between.</p><p>While competition in this space is fierce, the QuietComfort Ultra earbuds (Gen 2) make it clear that these Bose earbuds are the one to beat.

There are more color choices this time, with Bose offering the Gen 2 in Black, White Smoke, Deep Plum, and Midnight Violet. I tested the White Smoke, and they're more subtle, but some of the other colors look more exciting.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/i-used-bose-quietcomfort-ultra-earbuds-gen-2-for-a-month">Bose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds (Gen 2)</a> retail for $299, which is the same price as the first-generation pair.

They're the exact same as the first-generation model, but that's because they didn't need changing. The Bluetooth earpiece-style appearance of the earbuds does make them look a bit dated, although the design helped Bose cram battery life and audio gear into this package.</p><p>QuietComfort Ultra earbuds (Gen 2) are certainly on the larger side; however, the big surface on the outer side of the earbud provides plenty of room for swipe gestures and media control. There are no buttons on the earbuds, just the capacitive touch area, which can be personalized in the Bose app on iOS and Android.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2Ex7Hb8usPGwUQu8HMLxcE" name="Bose-QC-Ultra-Gen2-Earbuds-4" alt="The Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2 earbuds showing a single earbud and its ear tip." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2Ex7Hb8usPGwUQu8HMLxcE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I have issues with certain earbud styles staying in my ear securely, and naturally, I thought the large footprint of the QuietComfort Ultra earbuds (Gen 2) would pose an issue. My experience turned out to be the complete opposite.</p><p>The silicone ear tips with a built-in earwax guard, the stability bands, and overall design combine to create a secure and comfortable fit. You get three pairs of ear tips and stability bands each in the box to tailor your fit. The stability bands are crucial — they're silicone inserts that rest against your outer ear and ear lobe to add another point of security.</p><p>I took the QuietComfort Ultra earbuds (Gen 2) on multiple runs, and became even more impressed with their fitment. I can comfortably say these earbuds offer the best fit of any pair that doesn't have a physical ear hook for stability. My typical running earbuds are the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/beats-powerbeats-pro-2-review">Powerbeats Pro 2</a>, which have an ear hook, but the QuietComfort Ultra earbuds (Gen 2) felt just as secure. In fact, the Bose earbuds actually felt better in the ear, but they're lacking the hooks for peace-of-mind.</p><p>In other words, the QuietComfort Ultra earbuds (Gen 2) are more than suited for comfortable, everyday wear and can even handle double duty as a workout pair. They do only have an IPX4 water-resistance rating, so be wary of sweat and rain.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="egFbQukXBHof9cuAR5vbbG" name="Bose-QC-Ultra-Gen2-Earbuds-8" alt="The Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2 earbuds in their case beside a phone with the Bose app open." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/egFbQukXBHof9cuAR5vbbG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are more changes when it comes to audio and ANC, but the overall experience is the same. You still get Bluetooth 5.3 support and compatibility with AAC, SBC, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/qualcomm-aptx">AptX Adaptive codecs</a>. Unfortunately, support for AptX on phones isn't as good as we'd like it to be, so you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/this-tiny-dongle-brings-aptx-lossless-to-any-phone-and-its-fantastic">may need a transmitter</a> to take advantage of the earbuds' 24-bit lossless support.</p><p>In terms of sound, the QuietComfort Ultra (Gen 2) deliver the best bass performance I've ever heard out of a pair of wireless earbuds. It doesn't seem to come at the expensive of the rest of the soundstage, with mids and highs still present. The earbuds have an Immersive Audio mode for those that like a spatial effect, and the Bose app adds a stellar EQ that lets you tune the sound signature to your liking.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GasGWnnHNdLtmGS8iZDqJF" name="Bose-QC-Ultra-Gen2-Earbuds-10" alt="The Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2 earbuds in their case beside a phone with the Bose app open." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GasGWnnHNdLtmGS8iZDqJF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While the Bose earbuds prioritize bass much like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/i-put-oneplus-buds-4-up-against-buds-pro-3">OnePlus Buds Pro 3</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/nothing-ear-3-review">Nothing Ear 3</a>, I find that their sound profile doesn't change the listening experience for indie and jazzy tracks — that's a good thing. So, even though you can adjust the EQ if you find the earbuds too bassy, you probably won't need to.</p><p>Bose is using AI to provide better ANC and call quality, and it leads to impressive results. Aside from the basic ANC and Aware modes, there's a new ActiveSense mode here that offers transparency while still blocking out extreme burst of noise. Think a police siren or a passing train near a busy street. It's impressive, and I successfully used the ANC to cancel out noise on part of an intercontinental flight, even though I'd still prefer over-ears for that specific use case.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-bose-quietcomfort-ultra-earbuds-gen-2-what-s-not-good"><span>Bose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds (Gen 2): What's not good</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="q29qrUxhfjafaSED9wXaDA" name="Bose-QC-Ultra-Gen2-Earbuds-6" alt="The Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2 earbuds showing a single earbud with the Bose logo facing outward." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/q29qrUxhfjafaSED9wXaDA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Buyer's guides</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds"><strong>Best wireless earbuds</strong></a></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones"><strong>Best wireless headphones</strong></a></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/best-wireless-earbuds-for-noise-cancellation-2025"><strong>Best ANC earbuds</strong></a></p></div></div><p>There are only two clear drawbacks to the QuietComfort Ultra earbuds (Gen 2) worth pointing out. The first is that the capacitive touch controls are lackluster, and had me wishing for physical buttons. They don't miss any gestures or tap, which is great, but are a little overeager. Adjusting the fit of your earbuds by twisting them into your ear will probably pause your music, which can be frustrating at times.</p><p>Earbuds like Powerbeats Pro 2, which have a play/pause button and volume rocker, provide a better on-earbud experience than Bose — that's too be expected. But other earbuds with capacitive earbud stems, such as the AirPods Pro 3 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">Galaxy Buds 3 Pro</a>, are also better at avoiding accidental inputs.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="G3E7RbsAyNz8imcJYqzgQm" name="Bose-QC-Ultra-Gen2-Earbuds-2" alt="The Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2 earbuds with their case opened." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/G3E7RbsAyNz8imcJYqzgQm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Then, there's a battery life. It's great that the QuietComfort Ultra earbuds (Gen 2) now come with a wireless charging case as standard. Before, you had to add a clunky wireless charging cover for an extra $50 to add that feature.</p><p>However, the six-hour battery life per earbud is unimpressive. The charging case only brings that total up to 24 hours, so heavy users like myself find themselves needing to charge the case multiple times per week. It's also worth noting that if you turn on Immersive Audio, that'll fall to just four hours of battery life per earbud.</p><p>Six hours of playback time isn't out of the ordinary with ANC enabled, but it's barely enough to cover my regular flight from Phoenix to New York, and it won't last a full workday. Apple just added eight-hour battery life to the AirPods Pro 3, so the QuietComfort Ultra earbuds (Gen 2) are starting to lag behind in this regard.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-bose-quietcomfort-ultra-earbuds-gen-2-competition"><span>Bose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds (Gen 2): Competition</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="w2MHcutzKG6qVwHvmHCQcH" name="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds 2nd Gen" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds Gen 2 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/w2MHcutzKG6qVwHvmHCQcH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's never been more competition for great wireless earbuds for ANC, so Bose had its work cut out for it when making the QuietComfort Ultra earbuds (Gen 2). I think they're the pair of wireless earbuds to beat — other products might beat Bose in one or two areas, but none match the complete experience. For instance, I've been testing the brand-new AirPods Pro 3 against the Bose earbuds, and Apple's earbuds are better at battery life and noise canceling but are still severely behind in comfort and fit.</p><p>I'd also give Bose the edge over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sony-wf-1000xm5-review">Sony WF-1000XM5 earbuds</a>, which simply cannot fit in my ears comfortably, and don't sound as good in my view. The closest competitor in sound may be the Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro, which are similarly full in the low-end but don't fit as securely and have worse ANC.</p><p>As such, if you have $299 to spend on ANC earbuds with excellent fitment, the Bose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds (Gen 2) are your best option.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-bose-quietcomfort-ultra-earbuds-gen-2-should-you-buy-them"><span>Bose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds (Gen 2): Should you buy them?</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QTAdWzpFLPd4kgpSxRwfZG" name="Bose-QC-Ultra-Gen2-Earbuds-7" alt="The Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2 earbuds in their case beside a phone with the Bose app open." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QTAdWzpFLPd4kgpSxRwfZG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>You should buy these if...</strong></p><ul><li>You want industry-leading comfort and a secure fit for workouts</li><li>You crave a full and deep sound signature with excellent bass</li><li>You need platform-agnostic ANC earbuds that work with any Bluetooth device</li></ul><p><strong>You shouldn't buy these if...</strong></p><ul><li>You find the earbud and charging case size to be too large</li><li>You'd rather buy a cheaper pair of earbuds closer to the $200 price point</li><li>You don't like the earbuds' loud audio profile and booming bass</li></ul><p>Bose delivers fantastic sound and great ANC on the QuietComfort Ultra earbuds (Gen 2), but so do many other audio brands. What separates the Bose earbuds from the field is their top-notch comfort and fit. While you might expect them to be uncomfortable or finicky due to their large size, the opposite is true. Between their design, custom ear tips, and silicone stabilizers, the QuietComfort Ultra earbuds (Gen 2) are the most comfortable wireless earbuds I've ever worn.</p><p>The tricky thing about comfort and fit as a feature is that it's different for everyone. I trust the QuietComfort Ultra earbuds (Gen 2) to fit for most people's ears, but not all will need the fine-tuned fit and security. Some would be just fine wearing AirPods, Galaxy Buds, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-review">Pixel Buds</a>. If that's the case for you, snagging a high-end pair of earbuds from Apple, Samsung, or Google might be a better option than paying as much as $100 more for Bose earbuds.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="9f37e178-d333-4d23-b7b1-5ff91df7f7d2">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YJwSx2qUb66cj6TbCtJWEE.jpg' alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds Gen 2"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Bose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds Gen 2</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The ones to beat</strong></em></p><p>While there are many challengers, the Bose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds (Gen 2) provide the best mix of comfort, battery life, sound quality, and ANC.

Make sure to <a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=androidcentral.com"><strong>set Android Central as a preferred source</strong></a> in Google Search, and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should"><strong>find out why you should</strong></a> so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediateks-dimensity-9400-is-the-biggest-challenger-to-qualcomm-yet">MediaTek has been killing it</a> the past couple of years when it comes to chips for high-end electronics. While you might think of the company as one that provides cheap, steady workhorse chips for budget gear, the Dimensity line boasts specs just as powerful as whatever name you think of when it comes to a premium smartphone chip. OK, it's Qualcomm, and we all know it's Qualcomm.</p><p>The latest, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek/mediatek-dimensity-9500-is-android-powerhouse-with-major-performance-gains">Dimensity 9500</a>, looks like it got every improvement possible, especially in the right places: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">AI processing</a>. Like it or not, your smart devices are going to become more and more AI-centric, so whatever chip can process it all fast and efficiently is going to feel like it works "better" than the others. MediaTek is right there.</p><p>Everything I think about the Dimensity 9500 is based on what it does "on paper," just like the flagship Dimensity chips before it, simply because I live in the United States and buy phones designed for the United States. AKA: phones <em>without </em>a MediaTek Dimensity 9500 chip inside.</p><p>That makes me sad. Yes, I know I can easily buy a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/everything-you-need-know-importing-xiaomi-phone-us">Xiaomi phone</a> that uses the chip I want to try, but that's not exactly what I want. I want to try a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-11">Pixel 11</a>, for example, with one in it so I can see how it compares to the others. Since trying the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review">Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra</a> and its MediaTek 9300 Plus, I've been itching to try it on a phone that I'm familiar with.</p><p>I had my hopes up at one time for Google to partner with MediaTek (the two companies are very friendly) in the Pixel phones, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-can-a-tech-giant-build-a-smartphone-chip-without-its-own-foundry">designing its own chip</a> is a smarter move, so I won't grumble.</p><p>I simply do not care about how it performs on paper. I do not give a flying, well you know, about benchmarks. I can say anything in a press release and be confident nobody will ever spend the time to prove it's not 100% accurate, and I can make a benchmark app tell you whatever number you want to see with a few minutes in Android Studio. Yeah, I'm saying companies tell little white lies to make their stuff look good. Always have, always will.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8037px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:67.13%;"><img id="8qNBCgTnsSLebADZVZvUNH" name="MediaTek Dimensity 9500 Infographic" alt="A MediaTek Dimensity 9500 infographic describing key stats about the SoC described throughout the article." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8qNBCgTnsSLebADZVZvUNH.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8037" height="5395" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: MediaTek)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I have used plenty of products with a MediaTek chip, including the 2024 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025">Motorola Razr</a> with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-7300-series-chips-announcement">Dimensity 7300X</a>. It's a good chip designed specifically for a flip phone but it's not the flagship powerhouse its bigger brothers are. Having said that, its really good, and you would never think you had a "budget" chip inside your new phone.</p><p>I think MediaTek's improvements to the data path and chain AI processing needs are a good move. It's also something every company likes to remind us they did whenever something new comes along.</p><p>Someone has to do it best, right? It might be MediaTek.

In short, OnePlus states that it's creating a new, dedicated U.S. account Community, with "tailored services" designed for those users on September 26. If you were once in the U.S. and are no longer there, you may <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://accounts.oneplus.com/information/oneplus-oversea-us-server-offline?source=community">change your region</a> to better reflect your current residence.</p><p>Getting into more detail, the post states that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.oneplus.com/">current global</a> Community forum will "no longer be accessible" to U.S. users on September 26 (EST). The new Community, designed especially for U.S. users, will come with its own app, as well.</p><p>If you've been active, meaning you've been posting content, etc., OnePlus says all of that's going with you. Posts, comments, and your favorites are tied to your account, the company states. It will remain available on the new U.S. Community and the Global sector.</p><p>OnePlus Global's Community team member, Yash Jain, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1953273941623570437?parentCid=1953974542728691720">posted further detail</a>s about this change on the forums. Jain states that this "is not a deprioritization of the U.S. region, in fact, it’s the opposite." OnePlus is pushing that this is a dedicated platform for its U.S. base that "will be distinct, and operated by a new Community Team based in the U.S."</p><h2 id="oneplus-changes-you-2">OnePlus Changes & You</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="WsU9mvB2gmHhcvGdrxR7wm" name="OnePlus 13" alt="OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WsU9mvB2gmHhcvGdrxR7wm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Once again, all these changes are going on September 26.

A single drop, knock, or bump could prove fatal for the Tab S11 Ultra's enormous 14.6-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X display. Trust me, you don't even want to know how much money that sort of damage repair will cost you. Instead of spending hundreds on screen replacement, spend ten to fifteen dollars on an excellent screen protector.</p><p>As per various reports, glass screen protectors do not work well with the official Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra Book Cover Keyboard Slim case. So, if you're planning on buying a tempered glass screen protector with the keyboard case, keep in mind that it won't fully close properly. In that case, a plastic film is better suited for you.</p><h2 id="every-inch-of-the-samsung-galaxy-tab-s11-ultra-s-display-needs-a-layer-of-reliable-protection-2">Every inch of the Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra's display needs a layer of reliable protection</h2>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_hero" data-id="d8fafaff-ef91-40ad-bb8a-f894ca31af5c">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TnYCZnJcrvk9yuJQDF9hTa.jpg' alt="Diacube 2-Pack Anti Glare Screen Protector with Blue Light Filter for Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Diacube 2-Pack Anti Glare Screen Protector with Blue Light Filter for Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Best overall</strong></em></p><p>The Diacube 2-Pack Anti Glare Screen Protector with Blue Light Filter for Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra gives you two matte PET films that repel fingerprints, protect from scratches, and are case-friendy, for just $16.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_hero" data-id="98eb728f-ed68-454e-b279-556266a40d58">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hWaodxLL63wSHqCUGLwZsV.jpg' alt="KCT Nano-Texture Glass Screen Protector Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">KCT Nano-Texture Glass Screen Protector Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Best matte glass</strong></em></p><p>For those seeking a matte glass protector, check out the KCT Nano-Texture Glass Screen Protector Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra.

You can choose from glossy and matte finishes, tempered glass and plastic film options, and even reusable or one-time use ones! Typically, though, most people pick a tempered glass screen protector as it adds robust shatter-proofing. However, there are multiple reports of glass protectors not letting the official Samsung Galaxy keyboard case close fully. Thus, if you plan on buying the keyboard case, you need to buy a plastic film instead of glass. Those who don't plan on getting the keyboard case don't need to worry about this issue and can opt for glass protection.</p><p>There are several great plastic screen protectors available for the Tab S11 Ultra. Gloss isn't everyone's cup of tea. So if you're looking for something with a matte finish, you can choose from several options. The Diacube 2-Pack Anti Glare Screen Protector with Blue Light Filter for Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra is a matte PET film that filters blue light, repels fingerprints, and is only 0.17mm wide, so it works well with a keyboard case.</p><p>Alternatively, the KCT Nano-Texture Glass Screen Protector Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra is a glass screen protector which adds more heavy-duty impact protection. It has an almost paper-like finish. This kit comes with a comprehensive alignment and installation tool, making it easy to install by yourself at home with no prior experience.</p><p>Keeping sustainability in mind, the reusable MoKo Removable Reusable Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra is a stalwart option as well. Although it's a little expensive at $30, you can take it off and use it again. This matte plastic screen guard is made of a durable PET material and can even be washed gently with water.</p><p>Once you've wrapped up screen protector shopping, turn your attention to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/best-samsung-galaxy-tab-s11-ultra-cases">best Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra cases</a> for full-body protection.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This thing weighs 690g, so it's actually much closer to a kilo than the smaller Tab S11. The best Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra cases make it a lot easier to use this glass and metal behemoth. Good cases also add drop protection, which is something you definitely need with such a large and heavy device. A kickstand is the most important feature to look for in a Tab S11 Ultra case, followed closely by a keyboard. Let's take a look at the best tablet covers that include these features.</p><h2 id="the-galaxy-tab-s11-is-one-hefty-tablet-get-a-case-with-a-stand-to-use-it-comfortably-2">The Galaxy Tab S11 is one hefty tablet — get a case with a stand to use it comfortably</h2>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_hero" data-id="c8ecaf1a-3e74-4768-9878-2b0ddf87221d">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NBk8nEWUyCeD7txZMtFTRj.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra Book Cover Keyboard Slim"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra Book Cover Keyboard Slim</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Best keyboard case</strong></em></p><p>Samsung's first-party keyboard case is fabulous.

First-party options from Samsung are the best of the lot, but they are eye-wateringly expensive, touting exorbitant price tags. The Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra Book Cover Keyboard Slim is wonderfully thin, adding a keyboard to your Tab S11 Ultra along with a stand. However, it costs over $200!</p><p>The Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra Smart Book Cover is the other Samsung case for the 14.6-inch tablet. While it costs half as much as the keyboard case and is also incredibly thin and lightweight, the $100 price is still too much for a mere case.</p><p>Spigen brings more affordable offerings to the table with the heavy-duty Rugged Armor Pro and Ultra Hybrid Pro for the Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra. Both cost about $50, add drop protection, come with S Pen holders, and have kickstands. Make a decision based on how light you need your tablet cover to be and what level of drop protection you're aiming for.</p><p>If $50 is still too much for you, there are cheaper options available. You could get an off-brand third-party case like the Ltezixal Case or the INFILAND Case, both of which cost $25 each. These cases fulfil the basic requirements of a Tab S11 Ultra case, such as a folio, impact protection, and a kickstand.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Sure, Apple's release is a tiny bit thinner than the Galaxy S25 Edge (5.8mm vs 5.64mm, respectively), but Samsung's phone is 2 grams lighter than its rival.

Without an accompanying discount, the S25 Edge is also $100 more expensive than the iPhone Air.</p><p>All things said and done, if you're paying full price for a smartphone, the iPhone Air might be the better deal for some folks. But throw on a record-smashing 36% discount and the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge becomes an absurdly better value. It might take months for the price of the Apple device to drop this low, so if you want a thin phone today, this choice is easy.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This means you could keep the editing simple by asking the image editor to "make this image" better, and Gemini will make the necessary adjustments to the image, like adjusting the brightness, contrast, and removing unnecessary noise from the picture, so you don't manually have to.  Or you can take it a step further, imagine your pet or that alpaca from the petting zoo chilling in Hawaii with a mojito—Gemini can make it happen.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="qPBHPvfadQUBfdcPwDUbMS" name="2nd In-Line animation" alt="Conversational photo editing in Google Photos" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qPBHPvfadQUBfdcPwDUbMS.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It makes things extremely easy when it comes to editing photos, since you can basically chat or speak to Gemini to make certain edits for you that seem somewhat of a task, like Magic Eraser; you previously had to manually refine areas that weren't fully erased, but Gemini streamlines this process.</p><p>But now,  with conversational edits, you can just give Gemini a prompt to “remove the cars in the background” or something more general like “restore this old photo,” and Photos will understand the changes you’re trying to make.

You can't complete your phone or tablet's basic protection without these two. With a screen that big, getting a screen guard is even more important than getting a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/best-samsung-galaxy-tab-s11-cases">case for your Samsung Galaxy Tab S11</a>. If you're planning on getting a keyboard case for your Tab S11, you can't get glass protection.</p><p>The Diacube 2-Pack Anti Glare Screen Protector with Blue Light Filter for Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 provides great value, delivering two high-quality PET films that work perfectly with Samsung's keyboard case for the Tab S11. Each of the two matte films in the box has a matte finish, filters out harmful blue light emissions from the tablet's screen, and repels fingerprints so the screen stays clean. This set will set you back about $16.</p><p>If you're on the hunt for something cheaper, the Supershieldz 3 Pack Anti-Glare Matte Screen Protector is less than $10. Meanwhile, the MoKo 2 Pack Paperfeel Screen Protector is slightly pricier at $13. Both are excellent choices and offer matte PET films at reasonable prices.</p><p>ZAGG's Glass Elite Tablet Screen Protector for Galaxy Tab S11 is a superb screen protector for your 11-inch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-tablets">Samsung tablet</a>. It comes with ZAGG's EZ Apply installation tray, is made of highly durable Glass Elite tempered glass that's five times stronger than the industry standard, and has an oil-repelling layer on top. The edges of the Glass Elite Tablet Screen Protector are reinforced to prevent cracks from spreading, even if they do occur. The only problem with this kit is the $50 price tag. And, of course, bear in mind that this is a glass pick, so you should only get it if you won't get the keyboard case.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Now, Meta is here with a second-generation version of the three iconic Ray-Ban smart glasses styles, packing revamped hardware. The recent Oakley Meta HSTN launch brought extra battery life and crisper video recording to Meta smart glasses, and now those advancements are headed to Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2.</p><p>Meta is continuing to sell the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review#section-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-specs-and-how-they-work">Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1</a> at a lower price than the Gen 2 smart glasses, creating an interesting dilemma for interested buyers. Should owners of the Gen 1 smart glasses upgrade to the Gen 2 revision, and should new buyers pay more for the extra features? Those are the questions we'll help you answer in this comparison between Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 and Gen 2. Let's dive in.</p><h2 id="ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-gen-2-vs-gen-1-pricing-and-availability-2">Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses Gen 2 vs Gen 1: Pricing and availability</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Zc3MgCRu9SatJ3cR5kjvs8" name="Ray-Ban-Meta-Gen-2-display-Meta-Store-4" alt="A display of Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) glasses in various styles." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Zc3MgCRu9SatJ3cR5kjvs8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Meta revealed the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 smart glasses at Connect 2025. They are available now online and at partner retailers for $379. They're sold in the same Wayfarer, Skyler, and Headliner styles as the first-generation smart glasses, but there are a few limited-edition colorways for early adopters. The same range of prescription lenses is supported, too, with prescriptions between -6.00 and +4.00 being compatible.</p><p>The Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 smart glasses are sticking around at a $299 price point, but some styles are out of stock. Skyler and Wayfarer styles appear to be available, although it's unclear for how long or if stock will be replenished. You can equip them with prescriptions between -6.00 and +4.00, just like Gen 2.</p><p>For those with advanced prescription needs, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-glasses-prescription-limitations-and-workaround">there are third-party workarounds available</a>.</p><h2 id="ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-gen-2-vs-gen-1-design-and-specs-2">Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses Gen 2 vs Gen 1: Design and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="nrnxwJW9AvBU3aj7emHzt8" name="Ray-Ban-Meta-Gen-2-Black-glasses-on-display" alt="Black Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 glasses sitting on a metal display shelf." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nrnxwJW9AvBU3aj7emHzt8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-gen-2">Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2</a> are identical to the first-generation pair of smart glasses from a design standpoint. You can choose between Wayfarer, Skyler, or Headliner styles depending on which you prefer, but these frames will look virtually identical across the Gen 1 and Gen 2 models. You get a camera on one side of the frames for photos and video recording, plus an LED indicator light on the opposite side to let others know when you're capturing content.</p><p>The big change to the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2's design and dimensions is that Meta managed to shave a few grams of weight off the frames. The new pair of smart glasses weighs 48 grams, down from 52 grams on the Gen 1 model.</p><p>I had comfort issues with Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 at times, partially due to the weight, which caused the glasses to slip down the bridge of my nose at times. I don't know whether the four-gram difference in weight will make the Gen 2 noticeably more comfortable, but I don't think it can hurt either.</p><div ><table><caption>Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 and Gen 2 specs</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2)</p></th><th  ><p>Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 1)</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Styles</p></td><td  ><p>Wayfarer, Headliner, Skyler</p></td><td  ><p>Wayfarer, Skyler, Headliner (out of stock)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Lenses</p></td><td  ><p>Polarized, Transitions, prescription (-6.0 to +4.0)</p></td><td  ><p>Polarized, Transitions, prescription (-6.0 to +4.0)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Camera</p></td><td  ><p>12MP Ultra-Wide</p></td><td  ><p>12MP Ultra-Wide</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Photo resolution</p></td><td  ><p>3024 X 4032 pixels (Portrait only)</p></td><td  ><p>3024 X 4032 pixels (Portrait default)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Video resolution</p></td><td  ><p>1200p at 60FPS</p><p>1440p at 30FPS</p><p>3K at 30FPS</p></td><td  ><p>1440 x 1920 pixels at 30 fps (Vertical default)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Speakers</p></td><td  ><p>2X open ear speakers</p></td><td  ><p>2X open ear speakers</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Microphones</p></td><td  ><p>Custom 5-mic Array (2 in left arm, 2 in right arm, 1 near nose pad)</p></td><td  ><p>Custom 5-mic Array (2 in left arm, 2 in right arm, 1 near nose pad)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>32GB; about 500 photos, 100 30-second videos</p></td><td  ><p>32GB; about 100+ videos (30 sec) and 500+ photos (3 frame burst)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 6; Bluetooth 5.3</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 6; Bluetooth 5.3</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Compatibility</p></td><td  ><p>iOS; Android</p></td><td  ><p>iOS; Android</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>52g</p></td><td  ><p>49.2g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Durability</p></td><td  ><p>IPX4</p></td><td  ><p>IPX4</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 8 hours per charge</p><p>5 hours continuous audio playback or voice calling</p></td><td  ><p>4 hours per charge: 30 minutes live streaming</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging (glasses) case</p></td><td  ><p>48 hours worth of charge</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 32 hours</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging speed</p></td><td  ><p>50% in 20 minutes</p></td><td  ><p>50% in 20 minutes</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Both the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 and Gen 2 smart glasses offer a 12MP ultra-wide camera, with support for 3024 X 4032 resolution photos.

Just like the Meta Oakley HSTN smart glasses, the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 glasses can last up to eight hours on a single charge. That's double the four-hour battery life of the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 smart glasses.</p><p>In the real world, that means you can take more photos, record more videos, and listen to more audio without needing to pop the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 into their charging case. In fact, the new model nets you five hours of continuous audio playback or voice calling. Both the Gen 1 and Gen 2 smart glasses can charge up to 50% in 20 minutes in a pinch.</p><p>You charge both pairs of smart glasses by popping them into an included charging case, which has its own internal battery and a USB-C port. The case is also used for pairing with the Meta AI companion app and has a button for connections and resets.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Zbs6FE7iQYqfKbPUdVcGua" name="Ray-Ban-Meta-Smart-Glasses-close-up.jpeg" alt="A close-up of the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Zbs6FE7iQYqfKbPUdVcGua.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-ai-is-evolving-again-and-its-resurrecting-the-metaverse">Meta AI is becoming more robust</a>, supporting voice assistance and camera inputs.

The second-generation Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses clear the originals in weight, camera quality, and battery life — all key areas. As such, paying the extra $80 for the Gen 2 is a no-brainer when you consider all the quality-of-life upgrades you'll get.</p><p>You should consider whether <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-hands-on-demo-impressions">Ray-Ban Meta Display</a>, Oakley Meta HSTN, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oakley-meta-vanguard-smart-glasses-hands-on">Oakley Meta Vanguard</a> might suit you better if you have specialized use cases, like the need for a display or fitness-focused glasses.</p><p>However, those with the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 smart glasses shouldn't feel the pressure to upgrade immediately. If the camera quality and battery life are meeting your expectations, hold onto them.

The update roadmap confirms that alongside the Phone 3, devices like the Phone 3a series, Phone 2 models, and CMF Phones will all get the upgrade.</p><p>For now, though, Phone 3 owners should head to Settings → Software Update and grab this release. Between the camera upgrades, performance fixes, and improved connectivity, it’s a worthwhile refresh ahead of the bigger changes to come.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The OpenFit 2 Plus brings back these same perks, largely unchanged.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="hg6yzbhLE9JDpwDxMtaS4a" name="Shokz-OpenFit-2-close-up" alt="A close-up of the Shokz OpenFit 2 earbuds, one facing the camera showing the logo and top button/speaker grill, the other laying on its back showing the main speaker grill, mic hole, and ear hook." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hg6yzbhLE9JDpwDxMtaS4a.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Now, however, the Shokz OpenFit 2 Plus has enabled a Dolby Audio mode, in addition to the current options like bass boost. This mode cuts the battery life down from 11 hours to 9 hours, but in exchange, you get richer, more cinematic audio, best suited for streaming movies or shows but also improving your workout playlists.</p><p>While we've yet to test the Dolby Audio mode, our friends at Techradar <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/fitness-headphones/i-went-for-a-run-with-the-all-new-shokz-openfit-2-and-theyre-already-threatening-to-become-my-go-to-running-headphones">reviewed the OpenFit 2+</a> and said that "everything becomes richer and more pronounced" with it toggled on, making the OpenFit 2 feel "obsolete" by comparison. We were impressed by the OpenFit 2's audio quality, which makes us excited to try this new mode.</p><p>In addition, the OpenFit 2 Plus comes with a Qi-compatible charging case, so you can leave your OpenFit 2s on a compatible <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-wireless-chargers">wireless charger</a> to refill its 48 hours of total capacity between workouts. USB-C charging currently refills the case and earbuds in about 100 minutes, but Shokz hasn't confirmed how long Qi charging will take.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1833px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="h2krhpdku4y736UtgmjhWW" name="Shokz-OpenFit-2-in-ear" alt="A close-up of one Shokz OpenFit 2 earbud in the reviewer's left ear" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h2krhpdku4y736UtgmjhWW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1833" height="1031" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Many recent wireless workout earbuds, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/beats-powerbeats-pro-2-review">Powerbeats Pro 2</a> and AirPods Pro 3, are using your ear canals to measure heart rate. It'll be interesting to see if this approach resonates with athletes, or if they'll prefer an option that leaves their ear canals open but still delivers Dolby-level sound.</p><p>Personally, I've continued to use the Shokz OpenFit 2 since I reviewed them months ago. They prevent any issues with impacted earwax or earbuds falling out during intense daily workouts; the sound quality is rich and immersive, but your ears are still open enough to preserve your spatial awareness and prevent problems during races.

Additionally, 6G is said to provide super low latency, meaning the time it takes for a signal to travel is expected to be reduced to microseconds, approximately a 1,000-fold improvement over 5G.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9wyywEe3rQigau5EgpDuVH" name="6G- samsung-plans" alt="Samsung lays out what's in store with 6G connectivity" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9wyywEe3rQigau5EgpDuVH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Furthermore, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nokia.com/6g/6g-explained/#:~:text=A%20network%20that%20can%20sense,the%20environment%2C%20people%20and%20objects.">Nokia states</a> that the new network will have the ability to "sense" the environment by using signals that will essentially bounce off obstacles or objects that come in its path. This will allow it to figure out what those objects are, where they are, how fast they're moving, and what they're made of.</p><p>By combining this information with AI, the network can create a "digital twin" of the physical world. This will allow companies to create a map that will provide 6G signals to the user faster.</p><p>Finally, Verizon is also working with organizations like 3GPP, so that their research in 6G aligns with network standards worldwide. "This helps create a unified 6G network that everyone can use, no matter who made their device or where they are," it added.</p> ]]></dc:content>

To get us going, Google states this major update is rolling out for viewers with a TCL QM9K series device. Consumers with the Google TV Streamer, Walmart onn. 4K Pro, 2025 Hisense U7, U8, and UX models, and 2025 TCL QM7K, QM8K, and X11K models will have to wait until "later this year."</p><p>This major Gemini for Google TV is calling the old (and still existing) Assistant old news, as the post states the newer AI model "goes beyond simple commands." Users can talk to Gemini with natural speech, as you would to a person sitting beside you. Saying "Hey Google" (or by pressing the mic button on your remote) will let you experience a new world of AI-assisted TV, such as when you're unsure about what to watch.</p><p>Google says users can ask Gemini to suggest some movies when it's hard to find something that two people with varying tastes may enjoy. If you like dramas, but your partner likes comedies, you can tell Gemini those interests and see what it finds.</p><p>Gemini can also get you "caught up" if you missed a season of a popular show, and it can even turn your "vague" show descriptions into something you can work with.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="FYV28kszRKm3Wbc6VKLCrJ" name="google-tv-gemini-launch-asking-question-example" alt="Gemini for Google TV delivers a floating bar of text with a user's voice prompt in it, asking for the AI to explain a recent show's season for them." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FYV28kszRKm3Wbc6VKLCrJ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="562" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="aMReUJLUJsaNe6kvynAErJ" name="google-tv-gemini-launch-educational-example" alt="Gemini for Google TV delivers a text-based explainer for a child about "why volcanoes erupt," as well as offering a row of YouTube videos." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aMReUJLUJsaNe6kvynAErJ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="562" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Gemini for Google TV is reportedly leaning into its educational abilities in this new update, and it's bringing YouTube with it. The company states that parents can ask Gemini to "explain" or expand on certain real-world phenomena. To explain, the post highlights that Gemini will deliver a text-based explainer, alongside a row of recommended YouTube videos to further the subject.</p><p>Moreover, Google teases that Gemini can also help you with tutorials and cooking ideas right from your TV.</p><p>As previously stated, Gemini for Google TV is rolling out today (Sep 22) for consumers with a TCL QM9K series device. The post alludes to there being even more Gemini capabilities "coming soon." We'll have to see if these additional features coincide with Gemini's release on more devices later in 2025.</p><h2 id="there-s-even-more-from-google-tv-on-the-way-2">There's even more from Google TV on the way</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oXcrZwfzk2M2rzeMv2kqtQ" name="google-tv-streamer-review-free-live-tv-2.jpg" alt="Google TV Streamer Free Live TV" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oXcrZwfzk2M2rzeMv2kqtQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We were hearing about this Gemini update for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-tvs-gemini-upgrade-promises-smarter-and-more-enjoyable-viewing-experience">Google TV during CES 2025</a>, which is when the company said you could just "speak naturally to your TV." That idea was stated alongside the idea that users wouldn't need to say "Hey Google." However, with today's update, we're seeing that the wake-up prompt is still there, but users can also press their microphone button and begin speaking.</p><p>Google stated that Gemini on Google TV would connect with a homeowner's smart devices, allowing the choice of checking in on doorbell cameras and more. This pretty much sounds like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv-updates-control-center-entertainment-smart-home">personal control center-esque update</a> we got a few months prior to CES 2025.</p><p>Google's current teaser of more Gemini features to come with its Google TV introduction was echoed in January. The company said that by the end of 2025, Google TV will feature proximity sensors that react to your presence, which could kick off a photo slideshow and more.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The design is thankfully unchanged, with Bose retaining the same aesthetic and build quality.</p><p>If anything, the biggest change this time has to do with the case; it has the same design as last time, but it now includes wireless charging as standard. This was a notable omission with the earlier model, and it's good to see Bose make amends. I was able to easily charge the case by plonking it down on the Qi 2 mat of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/baseus-nomos-140w-charging-station-review">Baseus Nomos charging station</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5025px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="pFGvSgn6wGLX77tgjEvmTH" name="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds 2nd Gen" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds Gen 2 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pFGvSgn6wGLX77tgjEvmTH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5025" height="2830" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Having used the QuietComfort Ultra extensively, the Gen 2 buds are immediately familiar. Bose sells the buds in four color choices — Black, White Smoke, Deep Plum, and Midnight Violet — and I'd suggest getting the violet model if you want a vibrant hue. I've got the White Smoke edition, and while the color is fine, it doesn't exactly stand out all that much.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5115px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="hD4WTxcKkzj2g7KHoHTTVH" name="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds 2nd Gen" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds Gen 2 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hD4WTxcKkzj2g7KHoHTTVH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5115" height="2881" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The fit is identical to its predecessor, and the stabilizers that sit outside the shell ensure you get a tight seal while still being comfortable. Although these buds look a little bigger than their rivals, there are absolutely no issues with comfort, and the sound nozzle doesn't extend too much into the inner ear. You get a good range of accessories to tailor the fit, and there's no fatigue even with long-term use. In short, they're among the most comfortable earbuds around today.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5060px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="FSsg3oePsu7v2FKfc2oSTH" name="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds 2nd Gen" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds Gen 2 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FSsg3oePsu7v2FKfc2oSTH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5060" height="2850" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The bundled ear tips include a filter by default, doing a better job protecting the shell.

Without knowing everything that was found and investigated, it's impossible to know how much of that is true, but it doesn't really matter because U.S. interests (public <em>and</em> private) would have just found another reason. Huawei needed to leave the market, and the faster the better.</p><p>It's about those little symbols at the top of your phone: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/explaining-5g-millimeter-wave-sub-6-low-band-and-other-terms-you-need-know">5G</a>. In the U.S., Huawei's phones weren't any better than others when it came to 5G connectivity, but Huawei makes more than phones. A lot more.</p><p>No, I don't mean <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/huawei-watch-ultimate-2-is-the-smartwatch-upgrade-you-need">watches</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/huawei-mediapad-m5-hands">tablets</a>. I mean "heavy" network gear and switches that telecom companies need. In particular, Huawei was able to make network equipment that worked as well as anyone else could build and sell it cheaper. When that happened, companies like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fierce-network.com/wireless/at-t-may-phase-out-huawei-equipment-network-upgrades-mexico#:~:text=AT&T%20will%20likely%20phase%20out,their%20networks%20outside%20the%20U.S." target="_blank">AT&T</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/11/ceo-hans-vestberg-says-verizon-does-not-use-any-huawei-equipment.html#:~:text=Verizon%20CEO:%20We're%20doing%20just%20fine%20without,from%20the%20Chinese%20trade%20war%2C%22%20says%20Vestberg" target="_blank">Verizon</a>, as well as more industrial companies we've never heard of, started to buy it.</p><p>The U.S. is weird when it comes to a "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/justice-department-vs-google-ruling-search-dominance">monopoly</a>" in the market. Some politicians think one <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/house-democrats-say-tech-companies-have-monopoly-needs-broken">should never exist,</a> some think only the companies they like should be able to dominate a market, but almost all of them feel that if there is going to be one, it can't be a company from China or with ties to the Chinese government.</p><p>Huawei is both, and the fears that it was state-sponsored before the ban may or may not have been true, but they are now. The very same thing would happen here in the U.S. if China banned a company with a high market share: the government would do whatever it takes to save it.</p><p>You can still buy a Huawei product in the U.S. from a reseller, but the hardware and the software are not going to work as designed, there will be no warranty, and it might not work at all. I'd advise against it.</p><h2 id="about-coming-back-2">About coming back</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="gLn9gs4gzbpGSJxqqD8zG9" name="NVIDIA-GPU-Tech-Conf-2.jpg" alt="GPU Technology Conference sign." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gLn9gs4gzbpGSJxqqD8zG9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1536" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure><p>Huawei has thrived despite being banned in the U.S. The company still sells plenty of phones and other mobile products, but it's also a leader when it comes to (you guessed it) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2025/08/leashing-chinese-ai-needs-smart-chip-controls.html#:~:text=According%20to%20SemiAnalysis%2C%20Huawei's%20new,memory%20bandwidth%2C%20and%20integrated%20networking." target="_blank">AI</a>. If Huawei ever wanted to do business here or with American companies without restrictions, a lot would have to change.</p><p>I don't think Huawei would be willing (or should be willing) to step backwards so it can sell more phones in the land of rampant consumerism. It should continue to build out a portfolio of products, services, and mobile offerings without caring what the U.S. government thinks about it. With the company further entrenched with the Chinese government and having expanded into the field of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/huawei-shows-off-ai-computing-system-rival-nvidias-top-product-2025-07-26/">AI hardware</a>, technology, and research, everything the "right" people did not like about Huawei is now even "worse" than it was when the ban was placed.</p><p>There is nothing wrong with the company striving to be an example of Chinese national pride, the same way Ford or General Motors once was in the U.S. Of course, I'm not privy to any information that would prove me wrong and have no say in the matter, so I'm going with it.</p> ]]></dc:content>

A range of its devices was posted on Amazon's marketplace as Oura sought to get ahead of its expected competition: Samsung.

Sweeny added that Samsung's (then-pending) introduction into smart rings gave Oura "validation" in what they were doing. We've since seen how that "validation" has become a real positive for Oura over this past year.</p><p>Recently, the smart ring company has continued to focus <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring/oura-ring-pregnancy-insights-perimenopause-features">on moms and premenopausal women</a>. The latter arrived as a new "Perimenopause Check-In" for women to track their symptoms and receive personalized health reports.

Samsung is also sweetening the deal by giving customers a storage boost to 512GB at no additional cost (a $120 value). </p><p>Considering that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phone</a> starts at a whopping $1,999.99, this might be your best chance to get the premium foldable for cheap (well, cheap-<em>er</em>) ahead of the holiday season.  </p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="ccb5fb1e-4470-438e-a45a-afd4014c9eaa" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$2,119.99" data-dimension48="$2,119.99" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-z-fold7/buy/galaxy-z-fold7-512gb-unlocked-sku-sm-f966uzkexaa/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="hHR4D74gywDog26AHRpRkG" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-official-render-bg-square" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hHR4D74gywDog26AHRpRkG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 512GB:</strong> <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-z-fold7/buy/galaxy-z-fold7-512gb-unlocked-sku-sm-f966uzkexaa/" data-dimension112="ccb5fb1e-4470-438e-a45a-afd4014c9eaa" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$2,119.99" data-dimension48="$2,119.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$2,119.99</del><strong> From $999.99 with trade-in | $1,699.99 without at Samsung</strong></a></p><p>The Galaxy Z Fold 7 is the best-selling <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a> that Samsung has ever produced, and it's about to get even more popular with these new deals.

Rather than focusing solely on packing laptop-level performance into a bulky folding smartphone, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is all about style. </p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4859px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bcanSSX2Fbnp8dxazFnqYV" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review-2" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bcanSSX2Fbnp8dxazFnqYV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4859" height="2733" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Measuring just 8.9mm of thickness when folded, this book-style smartphone is ridiculously sleek and lightweight, with a nearly-invisible center crease and two stunning 120Hz AMOLED displays.

Our testing showed that the Galaxy Z Fold 7 typically lasts around 20 hours with normal use.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Fold 7 also ditches S Pen support in favor of the thin profile, and you're only getting IP48 water and dust resistance. These are minor issues that may feel a bit nitpicky, but there are many folks who understandably might want more from a $2,000 phone.</p><p>To be honest, when I heard that Samsung was increasing the starting price of the Galaxy Z Fold 7 to $1,999.99, I had my doubts that anyone would be interested in paying such a premium. Clearly I was wrong, but if you (like me) were waiting for the right Galaxy Z Fold 7 deal to come along, now's your chance to grab the top-rated foldable at a much more reasonable price. </p> ]]></dc:content>
