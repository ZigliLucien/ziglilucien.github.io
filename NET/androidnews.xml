The agents are available in preview starting today, Aug. 5, including a GitHub Actions helper for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-cli-debuts-open-source-ai-agent">Gemini command-line interface (CLI)</a>.</p><p>The company says the fresh AI tools are the start of an agentic enterprise for its customers, which aims to bridge the operational and analytical needs of a business. Alongside the agentic helpers, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-is-giving-openai-more-computing-power-to-keep-up-with-everyones-ai-cravings">Google Cloud</a> is creating Gemini Data Agents APIs and the Agent Development Kit (ADK), which are the foundation for a customizable platform that can be used to create custom AI tools for unique workflows.</p><p>These are the new AI agents developers and businesses can try out now in Google Cloud:</p><ul><li><strong>Data Engineering Agent in BigQuery</strong> — a data-prepping agent optimized for cleaning, transforming, and preparing information for AI use.</li><li><strong>Data Science Agent in BigQuery Notebooks</strong> — a workspace agent that turns notebooks into intelligent infrastructure for data science teams.</li><li><strong>Conversational Analytics Agent + Code Interpreter</strong> — a chatbot-style tool that supports conversational question-and-answer dialogue using the context of unique data sets.</li><li><strong>Migration Agent for Spanner </strong>— a data modernization agent designed for Google Cloud's global database service, Spanner.</li><li><strong>Conversational Analytics API</strong> — a custom agent builder for developers and businesses.</li><li><strong>Gemini CLI GitHub Actions</strong> — a coding teammate for your GitHub repository, found in Gemini CLI.</li></ul><h2 id="everything-you-need-to-know-about-google-s-new-ai-agents-2">Everything you need to know about Google's new AI agents</h2><p>Google Cloud is for businesses, first-and-foremost, and these AI agents are intended to help with everything from software development and data analytics to managing global distribution and infrastructure networks. For example, the Data Engineering Agent can automate workflows that were once manual processes. It supports data ingestion from external sources, like Google Cloud Storage, and can complete contextual actions on your behalf.</p><p>Google provides the example prompt of "Create a pipeline to load a CSV file, cleanse these columns, and join it with another table." With that, the Data Engineering Agent can complete the multi-action requests independently. The Spanner Migration Agent can work in tandem with the Data Engineering Agent, as it's intended for legacy systems that are still needing modernization.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2444px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:45.34%;"><img id="vy9A6Sq8X4e83VJDSvix5A" name="Google-Data-Science-Agent" alt="The data science agent in Google Cloud." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vy9A6Sq8X4e83VJDSvix5A.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2444" height="1108" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Data Science Agent can automate typical analytical workflows, according to Google. It handles common tasks like exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, featurization, and machine learning predictions based on provided data sets in either BigQuery or Vertex AI.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1176px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:45.92%;"><img id="ExKhJPFB79SdDzAJCim2RT" name="Conversational Analytics + Code Interpreter - July 2025" alt="Conversational analytics agent in Google Cloud." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ExKhJPFB79SdDzAJCim2RT.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1176" height="540" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Conversational Analytics Agent is also getting a boost, as it's now getting a Code Interpreter function. It receives thorough and specific natural language questions, and automatically converts them into Python code. From there, Code Interpreter can run the generated code, creating visual and interactive graphics based on the results. It's all running in Google Data Cloud, and thus the company claims it's secure and governed.</p><h2 id="gemini-cli-is-getting-better-for-teams-with-github-actions-2">Gemini CLI is getting better for teams with GitHub Actions</h2><p>Finally, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> CLI is getting an upgrade that enhances multi-user support and GitHub integration. For those unfamiliar, Gemini CLI is a command-line terminal for Gemini that's open-source and can be run locally. It's available in beta globally now on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/google-github-actions/run-gemini-cli" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p><p>The story behind Gemini CLI's new GitHub Actions agent is pretty interesting. Amidst a heavy burden of GitHub feature requests and contributions for the open-source Gemini CLI, Google needed a way to respond quickly at scale. So, it created GitHub Actions — an autonomous agent that can handle issue triage and pull request reviews independently. Now, it's giving away what it created to manage Gemini CLI issues and contributions as GitHub Actions.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:923px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:58.50%;"><img id="q4gu89pgDnnY9pftiMga5F" name="Looker MCP Server + Gemini CLI" alt="GitHub Actions running in Gemini CLI." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/q4gu89pgDnnY9pftiMga5F.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="923" height="540" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Aside from issue triage and pulling request reviews, GitHub Actions also serves as a collaborative coding agent that can work as your AI teammate.</p><p>All of these Google Cloud features are available in preview or beta starting today, and you can try them now.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The screen was fast enough to run all my normal apps, and the processor was even fast enough to play modern games. The only problem was that, while it was the size of a phone, it didn't have support for SIM cards, so it was ultimately just a tiny Kindle in disguise.</p><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Android Central Labs</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7WCXSEZSk3FX9EmxxzaGE9" name="android-central-labs-lloyd-logo.jpg" caption="" alt="Android Central's Lloyd mascot wearing a lab coat for the Android Central Labs column" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7WCXSEZSk3FX9EmxxzaGE9.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/android-central-labs">Android Central Labs</a> is a weekly column devoted to deep dives, experiments, and a focused look into the tech you use. It covers phones, tablets, and everything in between.</p></div></div><p>While Onyx released a follow-up device <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/boox-palma-2-note-air4-c-launch-details">a year later</a>, it still didn't include SIM support. Thankfully, Bigme has answered the call and created the HiBreak Pro, a device that not only is the same size as the Palma but also features an <em>even better</em> E Ink display, haptic motors, and, most importantly, a dual-SIM tray.</p><p>While most E Ink phones seem to focus on being "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/rise-in-minimalist-phones">minimalist phones</a>," the Bigme HiBreak Pro tosses that idea in the trash and, instead, works exactly like the Android phone you're probably already using. The big difference is that it has a Kindle-like E Ink display that makes daily reading a joy. Plus, it's so much easier on your eyes since you can turn the backlight completely off with the click of a button.</p><p>I took the HiBreak Pro on vacation with me last week and have continued using it for an additional couple of days, and I still can't believe this phone is real. It's a dream come true for anyone trying to avoid the negative effects of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a> or is just trying to get away from staring at a backlit screen all day, all without trying to take away all the apps and experiences you love on your smartphone.</p><h2 id="different-from-the-rest-2">Different from the rest</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JkH9VaYNStqK5iEcU7j93n" name="e-ink-phones-bigme-hibreak-pro-minimal-phone-mudita-kompakt" alt="A Mudita Kompakt, Minimal Phone, and Bigme HiBreak Pro next to each other on a white table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JkH9VaYNStqK5iEcU7j93n.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I've used several E Ink phones up until now, and all of them seem to suffer from one big issue or another. I compared the Minimal Phone and the Mudita Kompakt <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/an-e-ink-phone-isnt-something-you-just-switch-to-in-one-day">back in April</a> because both phones aim to provide a more minimalist experience to cure your digital addiction. While this is admirable, it's extraordinarily difficult for many people to stop using apps, social media, NFC payments, and other modern necessities.</p><p>I say 'necessities' because, try as I might, someone like me can't use a minimalist phone daily and still perform my job effectively. If you fall into this category but still want the eye-friendly experience created by an E Ink display, the Bigme HiBreak Pro is your only viable option on the market. That sounds like you'll be compromising, but the reality is that you really won't.</p><p>The only real "downside" to the phone is that the display is black and white only. It doesn't use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/bigme-b1051c-pro-color-e-ink-tablet-impressions">color E Ink</a> like some of Bigme's other devices, although that version is supposedly in the works for a later release. Instead, it uses a lovely 6.13-inch E Ink screen with a very fast refresh rate; <em>much </em>faster than the one on the Minimal Phone or Mudita Kompakt, and it makes a world of difference in daily use.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="tUiuRrSDyPXeQinQa7S8q9" name="bigme-hibreak-pro-youtube-video" alt="Watching a Zelda Tears of the Kingdom video on the YouTube app, running on a Bigme HiBreak Pro E Ink phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tUiuRrSDyPXeQinQa7S8q9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Watching videos on a black and white screen is a bit strange, but people did it less than a hundred years ago, so it just takes some getting used to. Even the contrast is good enough for most videos, although darker videos are just plain hard to see on any E Ink device I've used to date.</p><p>Apps and all normal smartphone functions work as you would expect. Want to launch the camera quickly? Double-click the power button and take the shot. Want to toggle the backlight so you're not wasting power during the day?

It's like reading a book, and it feels like magic when you use it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="465pC5VqZGqPbF6UFdwkAV" name="bigme-hibreak-pro-vs-onyx-boox-palma-2" alt="A Bigme HiBreak Pro (left) next to an Onyx Boox Palma 2 (right)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/465pC5VqZGqPbF6UFdwkAV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A Bigme HiBreak Pro (left) next to an Onyx Boox Palma 2 (right) </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While you might have trouble telling the Bigme HiBreak Pro apart from the Onyx Boox Palma at first glance, several upgrades make it a better device. Apart from the obvious advantage of 5G connectivity, it also has haptic motors inside, two customizable quick keys on the left side, as well as a fingerprint reader in the lovely red power button.</p><p>Unlike some other E Ink devices, the Bigme HiBreak Pro supports full NFC payments, and it even has an IR blaster up top for remote functionality. These are all assumed features of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>, but they've been anything but standard on E Ink phones so far.</p><p>Speaking of "standards," the Bigme HiBreak Pro sets a new standard for E Ink phone camera quality. I took a ton of pictures with the phone over the last week, and while it won't be vying for best phone camera any time soon, it's more than adequate quality.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FD5EWEwfkC2MwPLydUGmZ7" name="bigme-hibreak-pro-camera-sample-03" alt="Camera samples from a Bigme HiBreak Pro E Ink smartphone showing colorful books in a bookstore" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FD5EWEwfkC2MwPLydUGmZ7.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PLzuBaoCHm6LohWceqVCR6" name="bigme-hibreak-pro-camera-sample-04" alt="Camera samples from a Bigme HiBreak Pro E Ink smartphone showing fruit cobbler in a bowl" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PLzuBaoCHm6LohWceqVCR6.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KZVXFr4ANbpVQg6qRsHwb6" name="bigme-hibreak-pro-camera-sample-02" alt="Camera samples from a Bigme HiBreak Pro E Ink smartphone showing a restaurant kitchen and bar at night" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KZVXFr4ANbpVQg6qRsHwb6.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="P4DqZttGYncQJzMwrk47U6" name="bigme-hibreak-pro-camera-sample-05" alt="Camera samples from a Bigme HiBreak Pro E Ink smartphone showing a boy holding a cat" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P4DqZttGYncQJzMwrk47U6.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="gqs6q6gV5VYeSVeYnXdiQ7" name="bigme-hibreak-pro-camera-sample-01" alt="Camera samples from a Bigme HiBreak Pro E Ink smartphone showing spaghetti in a bowl" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gqs6q6gV5VYeSVeYnXdiQ7.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>I highlight this specifically because every other E Ink phone I've tried <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/e-ink-phones-are-amazing-but-you-might-want-to-keep-a-camera-nearby">has had a <em>terrible</em> camera</a>, and I recommended that users keep another phone in their pocket just to take pictures. That, of course, defeats the purpose of going E Ink as it'll just give you the temptation to use the other phone to doomscroll or revert to old habits.</p><p>It's actually quite weird to see pictures being taken on this phone, only to see it in full color on another device later and be surprised by the quality. The Bigme HiBreak Pro's camera was good enough that I didn't feel the need to find something else for regular photos, and that is enough for me to give it some kind of award.</p><h2 id="getting-e-ink-right-2">Getting E Ink right</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="cdy9ijtvt8WMbtNeuAFVSQ" name="bigme-hibreak-pro-camera" alt="Taking a picture of a cat using a Bigme HiBreak Pro E Ink smartphone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cdy9ijtvt8WMbtNeuAFVSQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of my biggest annoyances with E Ink devices is having to constantly change the display mode to best fit the content. Most modern E Ink devices do a decent job in the default display mode, but a lot of apps require you to tweak the image to get the best picture.</p><p>So far, I've <em>never</em> had to adjust the display mode on the Bigme HiBreak Pro. It understands how to tune it for the app that's running, and that's been a huge quality of life change I didn't expect. The only thing I adjust manually is the brightness level because I like control over the backlight, but even then, you could just set it to automatic and let it do its thing like normal.</p><p>Compared to every other E Ink device I have, this one rarely has to do that jarring full refresh cycle you probably associate with E Ink devices. Scrolling through a web page or even a long email looks like a normal display, and it's proof to me that Bigme's software is doing something better than its competitors.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="D3MkwVf6crxJaFmSwGEbij" name="bigme-hibreak-pro-reading-02" alt="Reading a book on a Bigme HiBreak Pro E Ink smartphone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/D3MkwVf6crxJaFmSwGEbij.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On the topic of software, while I found the default home screen launcher to be a bit underwhelming, I haven't had any issues changing it to something better, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bitpit.launcher">Niagara Launcher</a>. This one's my go-to for any E Ink or more "minimalist" phone, as it provides quick access to everything I need without fuss.</p><p>Daily performance and multitasking have been surprisingly good, and I seldom saw any app need to reload unless it had been a notable amount of time since I last used it. The multitasking UI is better than stock Android, as it shows quick cards for the 6 most recent open apps, with additional apps located in pages.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="bGDBsZ3TgG7iEZxNfFBCx7" name="bigme-hibreak-pro-quick-toggles" alt="The quick toggles UI on the Bigme HiBreak Pro E Ink smartphone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bGDBsZ3TgG7iEZxNfFBCx7.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="nPxkkYqAWBANcjj5jVNZ49" name="bigme-hibreak-pro-custom-buttons" alt="Customizing the side keys on the Bigme HiBreak Pro E Ink smartphone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nPxkkYqAWBANcjj5jVNZ49.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="m93NEwPUsMhh4WHaM6tBx7" name="bigme-hibreak-pro-home-screen-01" alt="Niagara Launcher running on the Bigme HiBreak Pro E Ink smartphone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/m93NEwPUsMhh4WHaM6tBx7.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ZaJfU3cKWUJmC4YbEb6Zw7" name="bigme-hibreak-pro-multitasking" alt="Multitasking on the Bigme HiBreak Pro E Ink smartphone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZaJfU3cKWUJmC4YbEb6Zw7.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Bigme's UI doesn't use stock Android gesture navigation, though, so there's no support for quick 2-app switching as you'll find on other Android phones. That's not a deal breaker, but it did take me a while to unlearn my regular usage of that gesture.</p><p>Even typing on the on-screen keyboard (I use Gboard) was just as fast as any other Android phone I've used. As I said with the camera previously, this is expected on a normal Android phone, but not something that normally works well on E Ink phones. Once again, Bigme surprises in the best way, and I find typing to be a great experience.</p><h2 id="specs-value-and-conclusion-2">Specs, value, and conclusion</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ebrCGh6TDq7zcbwVEwJ6CD" name="bigme-hibreak-pro-back" alt="The back of the Bigme HiBreak Pro E Ink smartphone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ebrCGh6TDq7zcbwVEwJ6CD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Bigme HiBreak Pro is quite affordable, retailing for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Bigme-HiBreak-Epaper-Phone-Android/dp/B0FBW5QMPN/"><strong>$459 on Amazon</strong></a>.

I tried to use the phone without this case for a while, but found it to be way too slippery. Thankfully, Bigme includes a silicone case in the box if you don't like the overly slippery plastic build. This case is extremely grippy and offers some decent padding for the device, which further adds to the value of the package.</p><p>While a fully polycarbonate phone sounds like a negative, I actually enjoyed the fact that there's zero possibility of breaking the screen if you drop it. That's a weirdly freeing reality in a world where most phones are some kind of metal and glass sandwich.</p><p>Overall, I <em>loved</em> using this phone and even found that, even while Bigme doesn't market this as a "minimalist phone," per se, the black & white E Ink display swayed me away from mindless scrolling I'm seldom prone to doing. To me, this is the ideal way to switch to an E Ink device without feeling the shellshock most other similar products create.</p><p>And, if you were wondering, yes, this display is completely flicker-free. No PWM dimming. No <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-users-have-had-just-about-enough-of-temporal-dithering">temporal dithering</a>.

One can only speculate, but I've been working in this industry long enough that I can give you a pretty good idea of what to expect in the coming weeks. Let's discuss. </p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-we-know"><span>What we know</span></h3><p>Like I mentioned above, the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold is likely to be revealed during an announcement event on August 20th with a keynote address scheduled for 10am PT. </p><p>Alongside the foldable, we're also set to get a first look at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Google Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro</a>, plus Google is expected to announce the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Pixel Watch 4</a> and Pixel Buds 2A. Some rumors have even suggested that the company will be formally announcing the release of its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/my-demo-with-googles-ar-glasses-went-better-than-the-one-on-stage">long-teased AR smart glasses</a>, but the validity of that rumor is far from certain. </p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="FgLGN6ffKxpzHiEBeJY7qF" name="android-16-qpr-beta-1-home-screen-pixel-9-pro-fold-2" alt="Android 16 QPR1 Beta 1 home screen on Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FgLGN6ffKxpzHiEBeJY7qF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As for specs, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is rumored to feature a 6.4-inch OLED cover display with an 8-inch OLED inner display. Both screens are expected to boast 3,000 nits of peak brightness, plus Google is reportedly working on a new-and-improved hinge that should make the phone a bit thinner and nicer to hold. Considering the ultra-sleek new design found on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> (the Fold's biggest competitor), this is probably a smart move on Google's part. </p><p>Under the hood, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is expected to sport the same Tensor G5 chipset that the Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro/10 Pro XL will use, plus rumors have suggested that the phone will feature an upgraded 5,015mAh battery. You'll also get 16GB of RAM as standard and storage variants up to 1TB. We're also expecting the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a> to come with IP68 ingress protection, which would be an industry first!</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7rjDMuoASB4nmdPX5tR2p7" name="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review-11.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold with Pixel Watch 3 and Pixel Buds Pro 2 in leaves" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7rjDMuoASB4nmdPX5tR2p7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>So what about the price? Well, looking at the competition, it's worth mentioning that both of Samsung's new foldable phones received considerable price increases, with the Galaxy Z Fold 7 clocking in at a ridiculous $1,999.99. Last year's Pixel 9 Pro Fold, on the other hand, had a starting price of $1,799.99.</p><p>Will Google follow the way of its competitors and up the price of the Pixel 10 series? It's hard to know for sure, but at least <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/could-we-be-the-reason-for-google-increasing-its-phone-prices">one rumor</a> has suggested that Google might actually <em>decrease </em>the starting price of its flagship foldable by $200. Only time will tell, but I wouldn't start celebrating just yet. </p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-will-the-pixel-9-pro-fold-get-a-price-drop"><span>Will the Pixel 9 Pro Fold get a price drop?</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="FdQPMvzaW7dKx6bnWfZJTP" name="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review-7.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold on table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FdQPMvzaW7dKx6bnWfZJTP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Now for the million-dollar question: <strong>will the Pixel 9 Pro Fold finally get cheaper when the next generation arrives?</strong> Since there's no way to know for certain, we have to look at the past to make an educated guess.</p><p>The phone that came before the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold was simply called the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a>. This foldable dropped in 2023 with a $1,799 price tag, and although it's a little hard to find nowadays, you can actually buy the Google Pixel Fold for as little as $989.99 nowadays through stores like Amazon and Best Buy. But of course, this is nearly three years after the device's launch, and I'm guessing you'd rather not wait that long to pick up the Pixel 9 Pro Fold.</p><p>Instead, I'd recommend waiting for a major sale event, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/back-to-school-your-ultimate-shopping-guide">Back to School 2025</a> or the upcoming Black Friday sales. By that time, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold will be considered last-gen, but most stores will still have stock that they're looking to ditch. After all, at this very moment you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-5g-256gb-unlocked-obsidian/6587911.p"><strong>get $500 off the phone at Best Buy</strong></a>, and the Pixel 10 version hasn't even been announced yet. Give it a few more weeks and I wouldn't be surprised if last year's foldable dropped to $1,000 or less. </p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="5efc47ab-f503-445f-a7d7-dc9e79d7b75d">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JissherrZpkPfUPoRgiLgn.jpg' alt="google pixel 9 pro fold square render 1"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The Pixel experience in a foldable package</strong></em></p><p>Although it's about to be supplanted by a newer model, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is still an impressive device with two glorious 120Hz OLED displays, a solid Tensor chipset, and outstanding battery life.

This feature is rolling out globally on computers and phones, letting users "describe any story you can imagine" and receive a 10-page storybook in return. Users don't just have to rely on their words with Gemini, as Google states, you can use a variety of external materials to help the AI see what you have in mind.</p><p>For example, Google says users can use their memories as fuel for Gemini. If you've got photos of a recent trip on your device, users can upload them to Gemini to tell it to create a story from that. Similarly, if you've got a little one, you can snap a picture of their drawing, too.</p><p>Google states users can tell Gemini that the photo is of their child's drawing and to create a storybook that "brings his/her drawing to life." If you're interested, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gemini.google.com/share/3727e49b234d">here's an example</a> of one such story created with Gemini.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TiYQadKvhGs" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Additionally, Google says parents can use Gemini's AI storybook creation to help their child or children understand complex topics or lessons, such as sharing.</p><p>Gemini's storybooks are outfitted with narration capabilities, meaning you'll have an AI voice to read your story aloud. It's perfect for those nights when you're far too tired. Parents can also share their stories or print them out, so your little one can ask you to read them again and again and again.</p><p>Google states this update is rolling out today (Aug 5), and that you can try it out. We've tested this out, and it seems available for the most part. "Storybook" is marked as an experiment right now, so keep that in mind when using it.</p><h2 id="gemini-advances-2">Gemini Advances</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:972px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.35%;"><img id="jkxE46dT4yPjLn9EDMVNXX" name="google-gemini-storybook-ai-creation-ask-example" alt="An example of asking Gemini if it can create a storybook, to which it replies "yes" and asks for the reader's age, the story's plot, and more." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jkxE46dT4yPjLn9EDMVNXX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="972" height="538" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nickolas Diaz / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Gemini's most recent (and substantial) update was in mid-July when Google introduced its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-2-5-flash-lite-generally-available-fastest-cost-efficient-series-version">2.5 Flash-Lite model</a>. After spending a month in "preview," the 2.5 Flash-Lite model arrived as Google's most cost-efficient version of Gemini. This update mainly focused on developers, as Google announced devs could find $0.10 per 1M token input and $0.40 for output.</p><p>Companies got in on the 2.5 Flash-Lite variant, as well, revealing that it's helped cut down on processing satellite telemetry and more. In short, this updated version of Flash is much lighter, meaning its processing should be speedy for math, coding, science, and such topics. Google states this model strikes a balance between speed and power, though other version of Gemini holds a little more power for more complex topics.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It's alleged "sources" state that Google will delay the market availability of the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, Pixel Watch 4, and Pixel Buds 2a by roughly two months. That paints an October picture for consumers interested in using those devices.</p><p>The publication adds that Google has reportedly run into "supply chain issues," and nothing more than that was said.</p><p>While the rumor suggests consumers should look toward early October for the previously mentioned devices, that theory seems to regard when your shipment should arrive. It looks like consumers can still pre-order the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, Pixel Watch 4, and Pixel Buds 2a after Google's event on August 20. It's just the wait to receive them that's going to be daunting, if this is true.</p><p>It seems as though this "delay" will affect all consumers, and it's not just region locked. Again, we're missing some context here, so we'll have to see what the Made by Google event holds later this month officially. The publication claims the other devices, the main Google Pixel 10 series, are on schedule.</p><h2 id="the-event-s-coming-up-2">The event's coming up</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="srNCFV47V4GVdhvZkNZ3km" name="google-pixel-watch-3-porcelain-on-stands-4.jpg" alt="Pixel Watch 3 41mm and 45mm with Porcelain bands" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/srNCFV47V4GVdhvZkNZ3km.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The folks at 9to5 thought back to the Pixel 9 series launch, which saw the base and Pro XL models ship in August, right after the event. However, everything else was scattered throughout September. While shipping delays have happened before, this alleged two-month wait (especially for Google's newest smartwatch) seems extreme.</p><p>The rumor is food for thought right now, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-teaser-roasts-apple-for-dragging-its-feet-on-siri">we've got another official Google teaser</a> to get us excited. The company posted a teaser for its Pixel 10 yesterday (Aug 4), which also threw shade at Apple. Google mocked Apple's sluggish progression toward Siri's big AI upgrade, which was previously promised for the iPhone 16. Since that has yet to arrive, Google says "just change your phone," with a not-so-subtle wink toward the Pixel 10 series.</p><p>Also, a recent Pixel Watch 4 rumor claims the device <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/turns-out-the-pixel-watch-4s-price-tag-isnt-half-bad">might not see a price boost</a>. Consumers might see a $349 and $399 price tag for its 41mm and 45mm sizes, respectively, just like in 2024. A surprising note is that the LTE model could drop by ~$50, which consumers might like.</p><p>Google's upcoming event is slated for August 20, where we will see its Pixel 10 series, Pixel Watch 4, Pixel Buds 2a, and more revealed.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The update highlights the company's focus on improving the shareability of what its users create and capture. Nothing starts with an update for "Flip-to-Record," stating users can now save their audio recordings or share them via texts and other platforms.</p><p>After finishing a recording, users can head to the three-dot menu of its overview and tap "Share." A new "Recording" option will be present, and tapping it will display a "Share" and "Save" button.</p><p>Nothing's example shows users should find convenient options, like Google Drive, Android's Quick Share, Discord (a messaging app), and more.</p><p>The second update concerns <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/how-use-nothing-essential-space">Essential Space's</a> "Memories." The post states users can export their captured content as an image, a PDF, or a Markdown file. There is something to note with this: while your captured content enables you to save it with a voice recording, the sharing function will not include that clip. Instead, when sharing a memory with others, Essential Space will create a snapshot of it.</p><p>You'll find the image you took at the top, with Essential Space's title for it and your audio file's transcription.</p><h2 id="nothing-os-2">Nothing OS</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:637px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:94.19%;"><img id="BciLgdGenfxe27jjpicMMY" name="nothing-essential-space-recording-sharing" alt="Users can now share an audio recording through Nothing OS latest update." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BciLgdGenfxe27jjpicMMY.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="637" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nothing)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:568px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:105.63%;"><img id="Rbz77E5emahSSUJ8LPrdKX" name="nothing-essential-space-memories-sharing" alt="Nothing's newest update lets users share "Memories" as an image, PDF, or a Markdown file." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Rbz77E5emahSSUJ8LPrdKX.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="568" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nothing)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>While these updates should be automatically downloaded to your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-phone-3-review">Phone 3</a>, Nothing states you can also manually install it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nothing.ntessentialspace&hl=en_GB">via the Play Store</a> when available.</p><p>This is the second update to Essential Space <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/nothings-essential-space-just-got-with-google-calendar-sync-and-more">in the past couple of weeks</a>.

The platform is tightening up its defenses against shady group invites, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-beta-prepares-optional-link-preview">sketchy messages</a>, and pyramid schemes disguised as quick cash gigs.</p><p>To tackle these threats, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whatsapp">WhatsApp</a> is experimenting with a feature that alerts you when a stranger drops you into a group. You’ll see key details, like who created the group and how many members are in it, before deciding whether to bail or stick around. Notifications stay muted until you confirm you want to stay.</p><p>For one-on-one chats, WhatsApp is also experimenting with warnings when messaging someone not in your contacts, adding extra context to help you decide if the conversation is legit.</p><h2 id="mass-account-purge-2">Mass account purge</h2><p>The Meta-owned platform says that in the first half of this year alone, WhatsApp booted over 6.8 million accounts linked to scam centers. Most of these are run by organized crime groups in Southeast Asia, often using forced labor. The cybercriminals are said to be using a mix of crypto bait, get-rich-quick schemes, and fake investment deals, all engineered to look just convincing enough to catch people off guard.</p><p>Scam campaigns now stretch across multiple platforms, sometimes all in one hit. A recent case linked to a scam center in Cambodia started with AI-generated messages created using ChatGPT, lured people into WhatsApp, and then quickly shuffled them off to Telegram and TikTok for bogus “paid” tasks. Victims were eventually asked to deposit money into a crypto wallet.</p><p>This kind of multi-app hopscotch isn’t random. It’s a deliberate strategy to stay under the radar by giving each platform only a tiny glimpse of what’s going on. It’s also one reason Meta, OpenAI, and other tech players are teaming up more often to share intelligence and cut off these scams before they snowball.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:87.08%;"><img id="xdzPRc82wt4p6tyTL22YeE" name="WhatsApp-scam-tips" alt="WhatsApp tips for fighting off scams" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xdzPRc82wt4p6tyTL22YeE.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1672" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WhatsApp)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:87.08%;"><img id="EpXajNqzrCEJmgZK8RDKgE" name="WhatsApp-scam-tips" alt="WhatsApp tips for fighting off scams" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EpXajNqzrCEJmgZK8RDKgE.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1672" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WhatsApp)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:87.08%;"><img id="Xxg5vRChmQz5rRfC6G35iE" name="WhatsApp-scam-tips" alt="WhatsApp tips for fighting off scams" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Xxg5vRChmQz5rRfC6G35iE.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1672" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WhatsApp)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>WhatsApp notes that scams usually start with something that seems harmless: a text, a job offer, maybe a DM about a lost package or unpaid bill.</p><p>The platform recommends taking a pause before replying to unfamiliar numbers, questioning any requests that sound urgent, and verifying who’s really on the other end.

The battery on this thing will last all day and well into a night of homework. Recharging it is simple with a good USB charger.</p><p><strong>It runs Chrome OS</strong>. This is a bigger deal than you may think because Chrome OS was designed to run well on even the most modest hardware. It's also a great way to tie into any online Google services and will sync directly with your Google Drive if that's how you want to go.</p><p><strong>It has a surprisingly good display</strong>.

The thing is, you can never change that number. You get 128GB no matter what.</p><p><strong>It has no SD card slot</strong>. Combined with the limited storage, this means you are going to have to juggle what you store on your Duet 11 Chromebook. No dropping that huge music collection on it.</p><p><strong>It doesn't have the best chip</strong>. The MediaTek Kompanio 838 is enough, but there's little headroom for stuff like playing games at 60 frames without stuttering.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-my-verdict"><span>My Verdict</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JByWPaeinqfw3jo8Ar8bjM" name="lenovo-chromebook-duet-11-review-16.jpg" alt="Cloud storage settings on Lenovo Chromebook Duet 11" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JByWPaeinqfw3jo8Ar8bjM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I wouldn't buy the Lenovo Duet 11 (2024) for myself because I don't need it.

Together, this new collection is said to bring stunning brilliance to Motorola's recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-series-hands-on">Razr 2025</a> and its newest open-ear buds, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/motorola-moto-loop-buds-review">Buds Loop</a>. Starting with the phone, Motorola highlights the Razr 2025's "accented and dazzling" use of Swarovski crystals on its "leather-inspired" finish.</p><p>The back of the Razr 2025 features the majority of the crystals in Motorola's new PANTONE Ice Melt color. The company has provided the device with a quilt-like design, where each indentation sports a shiny crystal. Motorola states there are "35 precisely hand-positioned Swarovski crystals, including a larger one with 26 facets on the hinge."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2732px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="jSn2xmmfkbu2akZfEJfcbG" name="Motorola-Razr-2025-Pantone-Ice-Melt-Swarovski-crystals" alt="The Motorola Razr 2025 in Pantone Ice Melt with Swarovski crystals" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jSn2xmmfkbu2akZfEJfcbG.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2732" height="1537" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The remainder of the foldable looks the same as you'd expect, with its full edge-to-edge cover display and dual camera array.

During that launch, the company already revealed the Buds Loop with a Swarovski crystal-inspired design. The crystals lined its stem, bringing a pop or brilliance to the device when worn, as it catches the light. The main difference is that the Swarovski crystals were only available for the Buds Loop PANTONE French Oak variant.</p><p>Now, launching alongside the Razr 2025 is a PANTONE Ice Melt option for the Buds Loop, as well. This cooler color option should pair well with the Swarovski crystals. Motorola reiterated the Buds Loop's open-ear design, which should help reduce user fatigue when worn for extended periods of time. Additionally, this open-ear design helps to keep users engaged with the world around them, so you're not completely unaware when outside.</p><p>This Swarovski collaboration is reportedly "just the beginning" for the Motorola Collection series. The post states this collection involves limited quantities and more devices "coming soon."</p><p>The collection, which features the Motorola Razr 2025 and Buds Loop in PANTONE Ice Melt with Swarovski crystals, will be available on August 7, starting at $999. Consumers can find the devices in the Brilliant Collection at Best Buy, Amazon, and Motorola.com. The company adds that its collection will also hit Cricket Wireless on August 15.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The wider it is, the more light it pulls in, giving you cleaner, more detailed photos, especially when you're shooting in the dark.</p><h2 id="more-light-less-noise-2">More light, less noise</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ossRtP7zanZnrXu8WcpxKZ" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-angled-view-face-down-1" alt="Angled view of the Galaxy S25 Ultra face-down" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ossRtP7zanZnrXu8WcpxKZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The f-number is basically the ratio between a camera’s focal length and the size of its aperture. The smaller the number, the wider the opening, and the more light your camera can take in.</p><p>Pairing the same sensor with an F/1.4 aperture lets the Galaxy S26 Ultra pull in more light, giving it a boost in low-light shots. It also creates a shallower depth of field, so you’ll get a nice background blur that makes subjects pop.</p><p>In a follow-up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1952338888921673912" target="_blank">post on X</a>, the leaker said the updated camera is rumored to take in about 47% more light than the one on the Galaxy S25 Ultra.</p><h2 id="pro-mode-fans-this-one-s-for-you-2">Pro mode fans, this one’s for you</h2><p>This upgrade might fly under the radar for casual users, but for photographers who rely on Samsung’s manual controls, that wider aperture is a big win, especially when shooting in low light.</p><p>Samsung and Google don’t usually shake up their smartphone camera hardware too often. But this new rumor hints that the next Galaxy Ultra might finally bring a big change to the table.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It would serve as a mighty fine opportunity for AYANEO to get some more publicity and brand recognition before launching a phone. However, I'm on the fence about whether AYANEO will actually be involved in any of the announcements.</p><p>Another potential scenario is that AYANEO could instead lean on the current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>. Doing so would likely mean cheaper processors, which would (hopefully) result in a less-expensive phone.

With this, users can connect to various devices, such as wireless earbuds and headphones, laptops, gaming controllers, and even other phones.</p><p>Bluetooth SIG, the body that regulates and establishes Bluetooth specifications, includes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bluetooth.com/learn-about-bluetooth/key-attributes/bluetooth-security/">security measures and resources</a> in the core specification to ensure that users can establish secure connections. However, the nature of Bluetooth, like many wireless technologies, makes it possible to take advantage of vulnerabilities. Thus, Bluetooth is not foolproof or 100% secure, and can be exploited to take control of your phone.</p><h2 id="don-t-worry-but-be-wary-2">Don't worry, but be wary</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="aLUy8iuHciU2NHQBpkHwui" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-ui-8-beta-1-auracast" alt="Using a pair of Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro to connect to an Auracast stream running on One UI 8 on a Samsnug Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aLUy8iuHciU2NHQBpkHwui.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That said, there's little reason to worry, but plenty of reasons to remain cautious.

For example, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/samsung-rolls-out-april-2025-update-for-galaxy-s25-series">April 2025 update</a> included fix <strong>SVE-2025-0255(CVE-2025-20946): Improper handling of exceptional conditions in pairing specific bluetooth devices in Galaxy Watch Bluetooth pairing</strong>.

The FCC has a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/how-protect-yourself-online">list of guidelines</a> on how you can protect yourself when using Bluetooth, including:</p><ul><li>Turning off Bluetooth when it's not in use.</li><li>Unpairing your phone from a rental car's Bluetooth and clearing any data.</li><li>Use Bluetooth in "hidden" mode.</li></ul><p>That last one is pretty easy, as your phone is only "discoverable" when you're present on the Bluetooth menu in your phone's settings. However, you should still be wary of and reject unfamiliar Bluetooth pairing requests. Otherwise, you should enjoy safely pairing your Galaxy S25 to your heart's content.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="2fbe6bab-1ec4-40ee-8b29-48fc8a124384">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/s9GUjxWjwvBNCNBC552HKi.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy S25"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy S25</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Small but mighty</strong></em></p><p>The Galaxy S25 is one of the best compact Android phones money can buy.

Google and Samsung each use different strategies to separate their flagship models. Google has the base model, Pro, and Pro XL, whereas Samsung uses a base model, Plus, and Ultra (plus the Edge, if you count it). This creates an interesting situation where the base Samsung Galaxy S25 will be competing with both the upcoming Pixel 10 <em>and</em> Pixel 10 Pro.</p><p>Ahead of Google's official unveiling of the Pixel 10 Pro in August, let's take a look at how this unreleased smartphone might compare to the current Galaxy S25. They're rumored to be more similar than you may think, each offering triple-camera systems on the back and smaller flagship-caliber displays. If you're in the market for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">great compact flagship</a>, you might be choosing between these two phones later this summer.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-pro-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-pricing-and-availability-2">Google Pixel 10 Pro vs. Samsung Galaxy S25: Pricing and availability</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Yh6bUfGy9n8ZzrhfyDaAJG" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-11" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy S25 outdoors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Yh6bUfGy9n8ZzrhfyDaAJG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/made-by-google-2025-how-to-watch-pixel-10-launch-and-what-to-expect">officially announced the Pixel 10 launch event</a>, and the Made by Google 2025 showcase is set for Aug. 20. We expect to see the entire <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10 series</a>, including the Pixel 10 Pro, debut at this event alongside new Pixel Watch and Pixel Buds models. Currently, the Pixel 10 Pro is expected to keep its $999 starting price point, but it's possible that it will change ahead of its launch.</p><p>The Google Pixel 10 Pro is rumored to start with 128GB of base storage for another year,  with higher-priced upgrades available to 256GB, 512GB, and possibly 1TB configurations. It's reported that the phone will be available in four colorways: Obsidian, Porcelain, Moonstone, and Jade. For those keeping track at home, that's black, white, bluish-gray, and green in normal colors.</p><p>Meanwhile, Samsung announced the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> in January, and it has been available for purchase since February. The base model starts with 128GB of storage but is more accessible at a cheaper $799 retail price.

Google Pixel phones have been on the bulky side of the market comparatively, and in a way, the brand is likely sticking to that identity too with the Pixel 10 Pro. The phone is rumored to get thicker and heavier, but it's also rumored to add features like magnetic Qi2 charging, a larger battery capacity, and faster charging across the board.</p><p>Those who enjoy small phones will find comfort in the Galaxy S25's tiny feel. It's expected to be smaller than the Pixel 10 Pro by every measure, and by a wide margin. The device measures 146.9 x 70.5 x 7.2 mm and weighs 162 grams, which is seriously light. By comparison, the Google Pixel 10 Pro is said to measure 152.8 x 72 x 8.6mm and weigh 207 grams, according to current rumors.</p><p>You get a lot in exchange for the bulkier feel. With that being said, the Pixel 10 Pro might feel gargantuan for some, and it'll only get worse when you start adding cases and screen protectors.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7XKdWmdmtNbQRWjCzVrU98" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-19" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy S25 outdoors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7XKdWmdmtNbQRWjCzVrU98.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A small part of the reason the Galaxy S25 is more compact than the rumored Pixel 10 Pro is due to its smaller display. The phone has a 6.2-inch Dynamic LTPO AMOLED 2X display panel, which can support 120Hz variable refresh rates. It's covered by Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2, and the entire phone has an IP68 rating against dust and water. It's a gorgeous panel, but it is slightly smaller than the 6.3-inch screen on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review" target="_blank">Pixel 9 Pro</a> and soon the Pixel 10 Pro.</p><p>The Pixel 10 Pro will at the very least match the Pixel 9 Pro's display specifications, so we're likely looking at a 6.3-inch Actua OLED panel with roughly a 1280 x 2856 resolution. We may also get 120Hz variable refresh rate support and a 3,000-nit brightness level. Like the Galaxy S25, the Pixel 10 Pro should be secured with Gorilla Glass Victus 2 and an IP68 certification.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-pro-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-hardware-and-specs-2">Google Pixel 10 Pro vs. Samsung Galaxy S25: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1275px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:64.39%;"><img id="MMjBc85Fui37azvpDwp9sG" name="pixel-10-magsafe-charging-leak" alt="Leaked image of Pixel 10 showcasing Pixesnap MagSafe-like wireless charging" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MMjBc85Fui37azvpDwp9sG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1275" height="821" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Evan Blass / X)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google is reportedly planning a few key hardware upgrades for the Pixel 10 Pro.

This year, the Tensor G5 is said to be manufactured by TSMC for the first time, which has people excited. It's possible the Tensor G5 will be more performant than any other Google chip thanks to TSMC's 3nm process node. It could mean the Pixel 10 Pro will finally be able to hang with Qualcomm-powered handsets in raw performance.</p><p>While Google is still trying to catch up to Qualcomm-powered phones, the Samsung Galaxy S25 <em>is</em> a Qualcomm-powered phone. The Galaxy S25 uses the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-vs-regular-snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy mobile platform</a>, which is a breakthrough SoC that may be the best in the world. The Pixel 10 Pro is expected to match the Galaxy S25's 12GB of memory, but it probably won't beat the Snapdragon 8 Elite and performance.</p><div ><table><caption>Specifications</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel 10 Pro (rumored/expected)</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy S25</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>Android 16</p><p>Seven years of OS upgrades</p><p></p></td><td  ><p>One UI 7 (Android 15) </p><p>Seven years of OS upgrades</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.3-inch 120Hz Actua OLED, 1280 x 2856, HDR, Gorilla Glass Victus 2, 3,000 nits peak</p></td><td  ><p>6.2-inch, Dynamic LTPO AMOLED 2X, 120Hz, Corning Gorilla Glass</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Tensor G5</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td><td  ><p>12GB </p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>128GB / 256GB / 512GB</p></td><td  ><p>128GB / 256GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear cameras</p></td><td  ><p>50MP main + 48MP telephoto + 48MP ultrawide</p></td><td  ><p>50MP main + 12MP telephoto + 12MP ultrawide</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Front camera</p></td><td  ><p>42MP</p></td><td  ><p>12MP </p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ingress protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Global 5G, Satellite SOS (U.S.), Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, NFC</p></td><td  ><p>5G (sub-6, mmWave), Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, NFC</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Security</p></td><td  ><p>Ultrasonic fingerprint sensor</p></td><td  ><p>Ultrasonic fingerprint sensor</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>4,870mAh</p></td><td  ><p>4,000mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>152.8 x 72 x 8.6mm; 207g</p></td><td  ><p>146.9 x 70.5 x 7.2 mm; 162g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Obsidian, Porcelain, Moonstone, Jade</p></td><td  ><p>Icyblue, Navy, Mint, and Silver Shadow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Google may be prepping to beat Samsung in one key area: Qi2 support.

We're expecting at least a 50MP main sensor, a 48MP telephoto lens, and a 48MP ultrawide.</p><p>Notably, the Pixel 10 Pro's telephoto camera should support 5x optical zoom, which will beat out the Galaxy S25's 3x optical zoom support.

There's also talk of a more powerful Tensor G5 chip and support for QI2 with inbuilt magnets, which are nice perks.</p><p>However, the Pixel 10 Pro is expected to retail for at least $1,000, and that's $200 more than the Galaxy S25 costs at full price.

The Google Pixel 10 Pro might be better than the Galaxy S25, but will it be a few hundred dollars better?</p><p>Maybe not, especially considering the Galaxy S25 has plenty of perks of its own. It includes a blazing-fast Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset and a thin-and-light chassis. All told, current rumors point to the Pixel 10 Pro facing stiff competition from the Galaxy S25 when the new Google phone launches.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="1d5b101c-12ce-414a-becc-0b8fec20cf85">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QL8HS5AC8SsigaibSHfKUW.jpg' alt="The leaked Google Pixel 10 Pro render shared by Evan Blass."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 10 Pro</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>A worthy challenger</strong></em></p><p>The Google Pixel 10 Pro won't be thinner or lighter than the Galaxy S25, but it may harness a more robust feature set.

Trifold phones have my attention! I question the durability, though. Foldables in general had a rough start and I like to keep a phone for a full two years. I'm wondering how having more glass and a second hinge is going to affect the longevity of the device.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Thanks in advance.</strong></em></p><p>Hi Rick. You also mentioned that English wasn't your first language and apologized for any errors, so I have to tell you that your English is better than mine!</p><p>In regard to your question, it's very important. It's also something that most people aren't thinking about and probably won't until enough people get a tri-fold device to show off pictures of broken ones on social media. That makes it doubly important to me. We saw the same scenario when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/first-things-you-should-do-with-the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Samsung debuted the Z Fold</a>, and displays started separating and cracking.</p><p>Your reasoning is very sound. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-does-glass-bend">mechanical problems with foldables</a> stem from using super-thin glass and a hinge. A tri-fold will have one more of both. When you make glass that thin, any imperfection will (not might, but will) cause a crack. In turn, that crack will grow until it reaches the edge of the glass itself and can go no further.</p><p>When the display layer is embedded into the glass sandwich, you have more than just a crack in the glass to contend with. Any ding or even a fingernail gouge could make the screen unusable.</p><p>To combat this, phone makers keep working on how the glass, the display component, and very tough and flexible polymers can be layered to toughen things up. A phone like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> is much better than the original Z Fold, and even better than last year's Fold 6 when it comes to the display materials.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="g96pvBZ3R3rWGXCVzMYXv4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5 next to other foldables" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/g96pvBZ3R3rWGXCVzMYXv4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Everything centers on the hinge, though. It's not the flashy showcase part of a foldable phone, but it should be because it's the most important. The hinge only needs to do one thing: open or close. But it has to do it perfectly, or it can add to the issues with using thin glass.</p><p>The hinge needs to prevent the glass from twisting while it's being bent. It also needs to be rigid enough to keep the glass firmly in place while open or closed. That's not easy to do, but phones with hinges are a lot better now than they used to be.</p><p>I have a feeling that the tech has progressed far enough that tri-folding phones won't be any more problematic than "regular" foldables. That means it should stand up to normal use, but it also means there are two points of failure. We will see more issues because of that extra moving part.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uDeTbeq5aaTuNwtk25zAPL" name="tecno-phantom-g-fold-full-concept-rear-panels" alt="The TECNO G Fold concept from behind, showing off its three panels and triple camera array." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uDeTbeq5aaTuNwtk25zAPL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: TECNO)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I wouldn't buy a tri-folding phone until version two comes out at the earliest. That gives a company a chance to look at what went well with the first version and what didn't go very well.</p><p>Having said that, you can buy a tri-fold today. I don't think something like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-is-the-most-exciting-phone-around">Huawei Mate XT</a> has sold millions just yet, but the internet isn't full of people with broken screens or other problems. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-galaxy-z-trifold-and-android-xr-headset-are-finally-landing-this-year">Samsung's Z model tri-fold</a>, said to be launching this year, will sell more phones, so we'll see if there will be more problems.</p><p>Still, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-tri-fold-phone-intrigues-me">idea of a tri-fold phone intrigues me</a> for the same reasons the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2024-review">Motorola Razr</a> did; it folds up smaller, just like you mentioned. I think they will be the device that unifies mobile computing and eventually can replace a phone, a tablet, and a laptop.</p><p>Like you, I need to know they'll be built to last, though.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="ce77ba15-d5b7-4729-8d7c-eca5902b1227">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n492cdTmAtXoxYWXC3iyrB.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Powerful and thin</strong></em></p><p>The Galaxy Z Fold 7 is Samsung's latest foldable phone, and it's as thin as it is powerful.

Google is now using that gap to its advantage, spotlighting the delay in its latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a> teaser.</p><p>Google’s latest Pixel 10 teaser on YouTube opens with a moody silhouette of the Pixel 10 Pro before finally pulling back the curtain on the full look.</p><p>The ad itself is pretty minimal, skipping over specs and new features to get straight to the point. Set to the instrumental of a classic Dr. Dre song, the video directly targets Apple Intelligence, calling out the year-long delay of a feature that was promised as "coming soon."</p><p>Google is clearly eyeing iPhone users with this one, telling them to “Get outside your comfort phone.” Then the voice-over goes in: "If you buy a new phone because of a feature that's coming soon, but it's been a full year, you could change your definition of 'soon' or you could just change your phone."</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZR_6Z1IDD8s" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><h2 id="apple-s-coming-soon-timeline-gets-called-out-2">Apple’s “coming soon” timeline gets called out</h2><p>The line clearly calls out Apple’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-needs-google-now-more-than-ever">long-delayed AI Siri upgrade</a>. The company promised a game-changing AI Siri with the iPhone 16, but more than a year later, the key features are still missing in action.</p><p>After an official delay, Apple is now quietly aiming for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-12/apple-targets-spring-2026-for-release-of-delayed-siri-ai-upgrade" target="_blank">spring 2026 launch</a>, though that’s just the internal timeline.</p><p>The ad closes with a full reveal of the Pixel 10 and a locked-in launch date: August 20, 2025. Ending a dig at Apple’s delays with an exact release day is Google's classic way of throwing the former's fuzzy AI timeline into sharper relief.</p><p>What really grabs attention is the Pixel 10 Pro in a new Moonstone finish, a metallic blue that’s clearly set to be the star of the lineup. It’s likely to be the crowd favorite, though matte black fans still have their classic fallback.</p><p>The teaser may be subtle, but the Pixel 10's design is no secret at this point. Even before <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-store-pixel-10-teaser-officially-series-design-launch-promo">Google's official preview</a>, leaks had already spilled the beans.

But as an audio nerd, I’m looking forward to hearing what the company has in store for the next pair of Google Pixel Buds.</p><p>Google teased the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/made-by-google-2025-how-to-watch-pixel-10-launch-and-what-to-expect">Aug. 20 keynote</a> by saying we’ll get the latest on “Pixel phones, watches, <strong>buds</strong>, and more.” While the Pixel Buds Pro 2 probably aren’t due for a refresh yet, the four-year-old Pixel Buds A-series could use an update. They still retail for $100 before any discounts, and lack necessities like active noise-canceling (ANC) by 2025 standards.</p><p>The rumor mill provides some insight as to what Google may be planning for Pixel Buds at its upcoming event, but there are still a ton of unknowns — like the earbuds’ potential specs and price point. Ahead of an expected announcement, I switched back to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-review">Pixel Buds Pro 2</a> to find out which features I’d love for the rumored Pixel Buds 2a to make more affordable. Considering how good the market for midrange earbuds currently is, Google has a lot of work to do.</p><h2 id="what-the-rumors-and-leaks-are-saying-about-the-google-pixel-buds-2a-2">What the rumors and leaks are saying about the Google Pixel Buds 2a</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RwXMrQQwYcf57vPZwFZbn6" name="Pixel-Buds-2a" alt="Pixel Buds 2a -Iris" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RwXMrQQwYcf57vPZwFZbn6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">An alleged leaked render of the Google Pixel Buds 2a.  </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While we haven’t heard anything about the Google Pixel Buds 2a hardware, a recent leak from Android Headlines claims to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/new-leak-shows-off-rumored-pixel-buds-2a-weeks-ahead-of-launch">reveal official renders for the budget earbuds</a>. Like the current Pixel Buds A-series, the Pixel Buds 2a render goes all-in on color, with bright colorways that match across the inside of the charging case and buds.</p><p>This is one way the Pixel Buds 2a can separate itself from the Pixel Buds Pro 2, as the premium earbuds only have the outside of the buds colored in — the inside portion of the buds and the case interior are both black regardless of what color you choose. For better or worse, it matches industry trends of offering more fun and exciting color options on cheaper products.</p><p>The alleged render shows the Pixel Buds 2a in what is believed to be the Iris colorway, and other rumors predict that there will also be Strawberry, Fog Light, and Hazel options.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="W66k9V7YduaGRKXazVjjfH" name="google-pixel-buds-a-series-review-26.jpg" alt="Google Pixel Buds A-Series in-hand with lid open outside" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/W66k9V7YduaGRKXazVjjfH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The original Google Pixel Buds A-series (2021) with the case open.  </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Daniel Bader / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Otherwise, the Pixel Buds 2a render appears to show Google sticking to its classic Pixel Buds design language. That includes earbuds without a stem and a pebble-shaped charging case that opens vertically from the top. This isn’t a bad thing, because Google has a good thing going with Pixel Buds design. It’s unique and matches the rest of the Google Pixel ecosystem.</p><p>There could be one hint in the leaked render that gives us an idea of what features the Google Pixel Buds 2a might offer. The earbuds themselves have some kind of vent or mesh grill that isn’t present on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-buds-series-review">original Pixel Buds A-series</a>. It doesn’t look identical to the openings we see on the Pixel Buds Pro 2, which are used for ANC, but they are definitely similar. If this render is accurate, the Pixel Buds 2a might offer ANC and transparency mode for the first time.</p><h2 id="what-i-want-the-pixel-buds-2a-to-borrow-from-the-pixel-buds-pro-2-2">What I want the Pixel Buds 2a to borrow from the Pixel Buds Pro 2</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="aWkHqyKNWznWRvZaEdZYpG" name="Google-Pixel-Buds-Pro-2-5" alt="The Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 in the Mint colorway in the hand." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aWkHqyKNWznWRvZaEdZYpG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The number one thing the Google Pixel Buds 2a need to borrow from the Pixel Buds Pro 2 is support for active noise-canceling. When the Pixel Buds A-series came out, you could get away with not offering ANC at the $100 price point. Fast-forward to 2025, and the situation is completely different. Even cheap earbuds have support for ANC of some kind. In fact, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/oneplus-buds-4-review">OnePlus Buds 4</a> have pretty great ANC despite costing only $130.</p><p>If Google is trying to hit the $100 price point with the Pixel Buds 2a, it still needs to include ANC and transparency mode functionality. The quality doesn’t have to be identical to the Pixel Buds Pro 2 — the company can cut the custom Tensor A1 chip used for audio and ANC processing or offer fewer microphones to keep the earbuds affordable. However, ANC <em>does </em>need to be there in some way, shape, or form, and based on the leaked Pixel Buds 2a render, Google knows that too.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PH6kd6he4CbSGcuQ9QxMjL" name="Google-Pixel-Buds-Pro-2-8" alt="The Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 in the Mint colorway beside their charging case." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PH6kd6he4CbSGcuQ9QxMjL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google should also improve the on-earbud controls for the Pixel Buds 2a. While I’m not usually a fan of capacitive buttons and gesture-based controls, they’re excellent on the Google Pixel Buds Pro 2. Every tap, swipe, and hold gesture is registered by my Pixel Buds Pro 2, and I don’t have to push super hard on the earbuds to activate them.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Pixel Buds A-series only offer half of the experience. You get playback control on the Pixel Buds A-series, but not swipe gestures for volume control. It’s annoying to have to reach for your phone or use a voice assistant to raise or lower the volume, and Google needs to address this on the Pixel Buds 2a.</p><p>That’s especially true if the Pixel Buds 2a are indeed getting support for ANC modes. The inclusion of ANC would add another set of tap and press controls to the Pixel Buds 2a, and the more on-earbud controls there are, the more reliable and useful they need to be.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="gZULkSsJYweAjdoMSeh8xM" name="Google-Pixel-Buds-Pro-2-2" alt="The Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 in the Mint colorway next to the Pixel Buds companion app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gZULkSsJYweAjdoMSeh8xM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Pixel Buds A-series case doesn’t have wireless charging support, while the Pixel Buds Pro 2 case does. It’s easy to throw the Pixel Buds Pro 2 on a charging pad to top up the case’s battery daily, or use a Pixel phone to reverse wireless charge the earbuds in a pinch. As a general rule, I’m totally fine with brands cutting wireless charging support from budget and midrange earbuds — I’d rather them focus on keeping the cost down and putting more emphasis on sound quality and ANC.</p><p>In terms of battery life, the Pixel Buds A-series are solid, but the Pixel Buds Pro 2 are outstanding. With the former, you’ll get five hours of listening time on a single charge. The more premium Pixel Buds Pro 2 give you up to 12 hours of playback with ANC off, and up to 48 hours including the charging case. Google doesn’t have to bring the Pixel Buds 2a all the way up to the Pixel Buds Pro 2’s level, but it does need to increase battery life to account for ANC usage, if it’s added.</p><h2 id="upgrades-could-come-at-a-cost-2">Upgrades could come at a cost</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JFv4Ly66qMm5zFb8kooMWE" name="Google-Pixel-Buds-Pro-2-7" alt="A single Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 earbud in the Mint colorway." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JFv4Ly66qMm5zFb8kooMWE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google doesn’t have a long list of things to add to the Pixel Buds 2a. There are some crucial changes that I think need to be made, like adding ANC support and swipe gestures. Beyond that, it’s all about the price.</p><p>The Google Pixel Buds A-series retail for $99, and the Pixel Buds Pro 2 cost $229. Considering the A-series came out in 2021, I wouldn’t be surprised by a price hike. The tricky part is that the Pixel Buds Pro 2 are regularly on sale for around $189 or less, and if the Pixel Buds 2a cost more, they could be tough to recommend alongside the standout Pro earbuds.</p><p>Made by Google 2025 is set for Aug. 20, and that’s when we’ll learn official details about the future of Pixel Buds.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="416e623a-658f-4587-a0b0-be301dcd0aa6">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/r79sxHXPuw8HMhSd2XKT74.jpg' alt="Google Pixel Buds Pro 2"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 </div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The best today</strong></em></p><p>With the Pixel Buds A-series due for a refresh, the Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 are the only pair of Pixel Buds you should buy right now.

Frankly, there just aren't very many 16-inch Chromebooks out there, with that being a space largely dominated by various Acer Chromebook options.</p><p>That said, the big screen isn't the <em>only</em> reason why this should be on your list, as it packs plenty of power with the i3-1315U chip. This is paired with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, which is pretty much what you'd expect from a budget Chromebook Plus model.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1700px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="vrocDf3kGSxoj5u2eyHmrR" name="Acer-Chromebook-Plus-516-hero-render" alt="Acer Chromebook Plus 516 promo render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vrocDf3kGSxoj5u2eyHmrR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1700" height="956" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Acer)</span></figcaption></figure><p>However, the Chromebook Plus 516 has another benefit when compared to even the 516 GE, and that's battery life. Despite its massive size, the battery is rated to last for more than 12 hours on a single charge. Even some of the more portable or premium Chromebooks can't match up to that.</p><p>And if you needed any more reasons to sway you, there's one more, and that's Google AI. When purchasing a new Chromebook Plus model (like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/acer-chromebook-plus-516-laptop-with-google-ai-16-wuxga-display-intel-i3-1315u-8gb-lpddr5-128gb-ufs-wi-fi-6e-steel-gray/6618158.p?skuId=6618158">CB Plus 516</a>), you'll have access to Google AI Pro for 12 months.</p><p>This includes being able to access Gemini from practically anywhere, along with 2TB of cloud storage, and NotebookLM already installed and pinned to the shelf out of the box. All of that, comes for free, saving you another $240, which is just madness.</p><h2 id="back-to-school-2025-quick-links-2">Back to school 2025 — quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Amazon:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals">discounted headphones, dorm appliances, and more</a></li><li><strong>Best Buy:</strong> <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals">up to $250 off Chromebooks, tablets</a></li><li><strong>Walmart:</strong> <a href="https://www.walmart.com/shop/savings/electronics">major savings on Chromebooks, smart TVs</a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/">foldable phones, trade-in opportunities</a></li><li><strong>Lenovo: </strong><a href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/d/deals/doorbusters/">epic laptop sale, free shipping for students</a></li><li><strong>Dell:</strong> <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/deals">students get 10% off all back-to-school purchases</a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

That's where it gets tricky — each major Android manufacturer has its own set of unique AI features. On top of that, many phones tap into external sources, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/chatgpt">ChatGPT</a> or Perplexity, for a more versatile experience.</p><p>Currently, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/5-best-ai-features-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Samsung offers the best mobile AI experience</a>. Galaxy AI is arguably the best mobile AI suite, and Samsung works with Google to ensure some of the most useful Gemini features are optimized for Galaxy phones. The "best of both worlds" situation is why I love using AI on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phones</a>, but Motorola is dangerously close to beating Galaxy AI at its own game.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a> uses a mix of AI models and services, includes Motorola-exclusive features, and relies on custom hardware buttons to make accessing it all easier. On paper, that's all the makings of a standout mobile AI suite. In reality, the execution is somewhat questionable. That being said, if you're looking for a sleeper contender that can win the mobile AI race with the right moves, it's Motorola.</p><h2 id="motorola-doesn-t-have-a-horse-in-the-ai-race-and-that-s-a-good-thing-2">Motorola doesn't have a horse in the AI race — and that's a good thing</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="G93igybGZ4Qzd96YFLxeZk" name="Moto-AI-5" alt="Moto AI features on the Motorola Razr 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/G93igybGZ4Qzd96YFLxeZk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When it comes to mobile AI, the most important thing is giving users choice — how much AI they want to use, which models and services they prefer, and whether compute is handled on or off device. For some Android brands, that philosophy might conflict with their broader AI strategy. It's unlikely that Google is going to integrate third-party AI models natively in Pixel phones, as that would hurt the company's efforts with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-2-5-deep-think-is-finally-heading-to-google-ai-ultra-users">DeepMind</a>, Gemini, and Google AI.</p><p>Motorola isn't trying to compete with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> or ChatGPT, and that gives it an advantage.

Meta's Llama models are used to power Catch Me Up, the notification-summarization feature. And, you can "Ask Copilot" when using Moto AI to tap into Microsoft and OpenAI smarts.</p><p>If that wasn't enough, Moto AI's backbone is built on Google AI. You also get all the Google features that are available cross-platform on Android, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/how-use-gemini-live-camera-screen-sharing">Gemini with live video and screen sharing support</a>.</p><h2 id="moto-ai-s-feature-set-is-rock-solid-2">Moto AI's feature set is rock solid</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Pi3BbcAzBFBdN8MNMzZAwj" name="Moto-AI-4" alt="Moto AI features on the Motorola Razr 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Pi3BbcAzBFBdN8MNMzZAwj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Motorola also seems to be picking the right AI features to develop, because many of them are actually useful. Pay Attention is an audio-recording feature that can transcribe and summarize meetings, conversations, and more on your smartphone.</p><p>I recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/i-wore-an-ai-voice-recorder-on-my-wrist-for-a-week-heres-how-it-went">tested an expensive dedicated AI recorder</a>, so there's clearly demand for this kind of tool. Eventually, I came to the realization that it could've just been an app. With Moto AI, it effectively is one, and it can help you pay more attention in meetings or calls.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YsMWjzGfD8cAbtMuZGwNQj" name="Moto-AI-1" alt="Moto AI features on the Motorola Razr 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YsMWjzGfD8cAbtMuZGwNQj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Remember This is another handy note-taking tool. Instead of audio recordings, it's intended to help you capture photos or screenshots and write text-based notes on the fly. You can snap a picture of a piece of paper you don't want to lose with a written note to help you remember what it is. I wish you didn't have to ask Moto AI's universal search for help recalling saved memories, but the concept is still helpful.</p><p>Finally, generative AI-based photo editing is a bit controversial, but it is solid with Moto AI. Magic Canvas will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-motorola-magic-canvas">create AI-generated images from scratch</a>, and Group Shot is Motorola's version of Best Take — it captures multiple photos to ensure that everyone in the photo has their eyes open in the resulting image.</p><p>The Moto AI suite is thorough but not overwhelming, partially because features like Next Move help show only the tools you'll need in a given situation.</p><h2 id="moto-ai-only-needs-a-few-tweaks-to-be-a-game-changer-2">Moto AI only needs a few tweaks to be a game-changer</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4089px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hgU4hPwJptqeQeMjBMRSMe" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-hands-on-15" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 AI key" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hgU4hPwJptqeQeMjBMRSMe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4089" height="2300" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>At the same time, Moto AI is a bit rough around the edges. The inclusion of the AI Key on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Motorola Razr Ultra 2025</a> was an excellent move, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/moto-edge-2025-ai-key-stylish-design-launch">it's already available on other Motorola phones</a>. Hardware buttons are an important part of mobile AI, because having the power button responsible for too many actions is a recipe for disaster.</p><p>The problem is, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/razr-ultra-ai-key-misses-the-mark-google-and-samsung-should-do-it-better">the AI Key in its current state is too limited</a> to be all that useful. Moto AI doesn't start listening when you trigger the AI Key — you need to also tap the mic button on the screen, which kind of defeats the point. You also can't remap it to Gemini or specific features aside from Remember This and Pay Attention. It'd be nice if it worked more like triggering a classic assistant, where Moto AI would start listening immediately.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2HfCBMWbuzxdsTZiTdxUFk" name="Moto-AI-6" alt="Moto AI features on the Motorola Razr 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2HfCBMWbuzxdsTZiTdxUFk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The AI Key is a microcosm for the Moto AI suite as a whole. With a few small changes, the AI Key could be incredibly useful and a differentiator for Motorola phones.</p><p>The same is true for Moto AI at large. If Motorola made it as easy to recall Remember This memories <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/nothing-essential-space-ai-hub-what-pixel-screenshots-should-have-been">as Nothing's Essential Space</a>, I'd love it.

The company could tweak all of these aspects of Moto AI in a software update. Considering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/android-15-is-widely-rolling-out-for-motorola-razr-plus-2024-owners-in-the-us">Moto AI only exited the beta testing stage</a> relatively recently, I'm optimistic Motorola is heading in the right direction.

There&apos;s also some trade-in credit up for grabs. </p><p>Considering that the clamshell device starts at a steep $1,099.99, these are some pretty tempting offers. The problem is that free gift card deals don&apos;t usually last this long following a device&apos;s street date, which means the promos could end at literally any time. I thought we&apos;d lose them on August 1st, but they&apos;re still chugging along.. for now. </p><p>Once the offers <em>do </em>expire, you&apos;ll still be able to find some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/best-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-deals">Galaxy Z Flip 7 promos</a> on the web, but it may be months before we see another no-strings deal like this. </p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="5a1be06f-53b7-49da-b3f7-85459c1a1290" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 256GB: $1,099.99, plus free $200 gift card at Amazon" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 256GB: $1,099.99, plus free $200 gift card at Amazon" href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Smartphone-Unlocked-Manufacturer-Warranty/dp/B0FDH649D7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="BtHJYArVipn2USEACJFFAC" name="Amazon-Logo.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BtHJYArVipn2USEACJFFAC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 256GB: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Smartphone-Unlocked-Manufacturer-Warranty/dp/B0FDH649D7" data-dimension112="5a1be06f-53b7-49da-b3f7-85459c1a1290" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 256GB: $1,099.99, plus free $200 gift card at Amazon" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 256GB: $1,099.99, plus free $200 gift card at Amazon"><strong>$1,099.99, plus free $200 gift card at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>Buy the Galaxy Z Flip 7 unlocked from Amazon and you'll get a free $200 gift card with your purchase, no strings attached.

Straight out of the box, the flip phone stuns with two AMOLED 120Hz displays, an unbelievably thin form factor with IP48 durability, and a virtually-invisible folding crease. It honestly feels like a slimmer Motorola Razr Ultra, and while that phone boasts a bit more power than its Samsung counterpart, the cheaper Z Flip 7 easily holds its own when you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-vs-motorola-razr-ultra-2025">directly compare the two</a>. </p><p>The Galaxy Z Flip 7 also features seven years of OS upgrades, a powerful Exynos 2500 chipset, and all of the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/5-best-ai-features-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Galaxy AI software features</a>. One bummer is that the phone&apos;s camera tech hasn&apos;t been upgraded since last year, and the slim design means that the Z Flip 7&apos;s battery life is serviceable, but not amazing. </p><p>Needless to say, if you&apos;ve been waiting for a good time to buy the Galaxy Z Flip 7 unlocked, these free gift card deals might be your best chance. Once these offers expire, however, you&apos;re probably better off waiting for the fall sales to arrive. </p> ]]></dc:content>

The certification appearance for the latter supposedly revealed Samsung's battery and charging upgrades for the device. This year's Galaxy Buds 3 FE were reportedly listed with a massive 900mAh charging case.</p><p>At the same time, the publication reports spotting an upgrade to the buds themselves.

The original pair, revealed in 2023, granted its buds with a 60mAh battery each, and popped a 479mAh battery in its charging case. Should these listings prove true, consumers might see quite an extension in battery life overall.</p><p>Rumors about Samsung's second-generation Buds FE have snuck up on us; however, they've begun to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/alleged-galaxy-buds-3-fe-pro-like-mirror-render-leaked">allege an upgraded experience</a>. In mid-July, reports supposedly revealed the Galaxy Buds 3 FE design via a render. If true, the buds could look quite similar to Samsung's Galaxy Buds 3 Pro with a black silicone tip and the "Blade Design."</p><p>It's also unclear if the Buds 3 FE will support Samsung's "Blade Lights." The base Galaxy Buds 3 do not support this, so there might be a chance that the FE variant skips this, too.</p><p>Other details are still in the dark, but there's a chance we're only a month away from a reveal. A report after Unpacked claimed Samsung was gearing up to unveil its Galaxy Tab S11 series <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/galaxy-tab-s11-series-launch-shortly-samsung-exec-comment-report">"shortly" after the event</a>, and that rumor placed the Buds 3 FE right beside it. It seems we're looking at a September launch, though nothing's set in stone just yet. Pricing is also a wonder for this year's Buds FE. We only have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-fe-launch">the original</a> to look back on from 2023, which debuted at $99.</p><ul><li><strong>Earbuds deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/promo/headphone-and-speaker-deals"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/browse/electronics/shop-headphones-by-type/3944_133251_1095191_1230614?sort=best_match&cat_id=3944_133251_1095191_1230614_1230476&stores=3081&ps=40"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=earbuds&crid=2RWE1G9N1EIF&sprefix=earbuds%2Caps%2C161&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/audio/all-audio/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/search/earbuds"><u><strong>Dell</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

This new NFC outlet, which would be "at the top of the device," would join the Galaxy series' pre-existing sensor near its cameras. It seems, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-management-furious-latest-product-design">yet again</a>, Samsung is looking at Apple for ways it can improve its user experience.</p><p>The publication cites a Samsung "official" who claims that while Apple "holds many" patents related to this NFC sensor upgrade, it's taken the company time to "technically circumvent them" for the upcoming Galaxy S26 series.</p><p>However, this is all in the name of convenience as Samsung reportedly seeks to upgrade the experiences users have with Samsung Wallet. It seems the OEM is listening to user feedback and grievances, such as failed NFC payments due to its sensor placement. What's more, it seems Samsung is interested in reducing "awkward hand movements" in order to get the NFC sensor to play nice with a retailer's scanner, per the publication.</p><p>There still seems to be some hesitancy around whether or not Samsung will debut this new NFC sensor on the Galaxy S26. We're only in August, so there's plenty of time for this to happen—or not.</p><h2 id="the-galaxy-s26-trail-thus-far-2">The Galaxy S26 trail thus far</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="ft67MBAmJGQn9RPKAJwj7k" name="lock-screen-variations-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-1" alt="Lock Screen Variations button on Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ft67MBAmJGQn9RPKAJwj7k.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As of late, there have been some rumored upgrades for the base Galaxy S26, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-ultra-leak-points-to-a-sweet-camera-upgrade-for-your-close-up-shots">which concern its cameras</a>. Some allege that its entire array won't see an upgrade, except for its telephoto lens, which could jump from 10MP to 12MP. The lens is speculated to retain its 3x zoom capabilities, but the alleged 12MP upgrade could help users capture even better shots. We also have a more recent rumor from the end of July that claims the Galaxy S26 Ultra could be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-ultra-leak-reveals-a-slimmer-beast-with-blazing-fast-charging">thinner with speedy charging</a>.</p><p>The Ultra model could feel lighter in consumer hands next year, while shaving off roughly 1mm, moving under the 7mm mark. For charging, tipsters purport the top-tier device could finally shed its 45W charging for 60W, though there are varying reports about this, so take it with a grain of salt.</p><p>Samsung's also recently updated its in-store shopping experience with its Wallet app by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-wallet-now-lets-you-split-in-store-payments-into-installments">rolling out installment plans</a> for users. The feature is designed to work with your eligible Visa or Mastercard.

Fortunately for you, we've already seen several Watch 4 leaks that give us an idea of what to expect — both positive and (potentially) negative. With Google discounting the Watch 3 to clear out stock, I'm here to help you decide if you should hold off or not.</p><p>When I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">reviewed the Pixel Watch 3</a>, I had a very positive experience, but that only raised my expectations for the Watch 4. The same applied when I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/qualcomms-next-wear-os-chipset-could-arrive-in-2025">interviewed the Qualcomm VP of wearables</a> about the brand's potential new Wear OS chipset. I thought this might be the generation that transformed Wear OS.</p><p>Instead, the rumored and leaked <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/google-pixel-watch-4-vs-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 4 vs. Pixel Watch 3 differences </a>we've seen have been more of a mixed bag. A brighter display with smaller borders sounds great, while low blood oxygen alerts will be an interesting foil to Samsung's sleep apnea detection. But we might not get the massive processor change I'd hoped for, and the changed design may have as many cons as pros.</p><h2 id="the-pixel-watch-4-s-most-subtle-and-significant-upgrade-2">The Pixel Watch 4's most subtle and significant upgrade</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kA9jCwiZciKyJ5aav5AtKe" name="Pixel-Watch-renders-03" alt="Pixel Watch 4 renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kA9jCwiZciKyJ5aav5AtKe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks/ via 91mobiles)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Pixel Watch 4 will allegedly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/pixel-watch-4-might-stick-with-the-same-chip-as-its-predecessors">use the Snapdragon W5 Gen 1</a>, the 2022 chip first introduced in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a>. That means it would keep the same four Cortex-A53 cores as before, while the latest Galaxy Watches use one Cortex-A78 and four Cortex-A55 cores.</p><p>If <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/pixel-watch-4-might-stick-with-the-same-chip-as-its-predecessors">this leak</a> is correct, that's one obvious reason to choose the Pixel Watch 3, or stick with a Watch 2: It'll have the same performance level. The Watch 3 is already capable of running <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-tested-new-gemini-wear-os-app-on-galaxy-watch-8-improvements-and-problems">Gemini on Wear OS</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/i-tested-early-wear-os-6-build-on-pixel-watch-3-at-google-io-2025">Wear OS 6 ran smoothly when I tested it</a>.</p><p>I'm not sure if Google chose not to upgrade the processor because it didn't think it <em>needed</em> the extra power or because its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/upcoming-pixel-watches-could-play-it-safe-and-i-dont-like-it">RISC-V plans with Qualcomm fell through</a>, but it's still disappointing if true.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/google-pixel-watch-4-specs">later leak</a> confirmed Google's plan, but also suggested the Watch 4 will swap out the 2016 Cortex-M33 co-processor with the 2020 Cortex-M55, making it capable of delivering "5x the AI workload at a fraction of the power."</p><p>Ask yourself if you plan to use Gemini often enough for this boost to matter, or if you can settle for a couple of extra seconds of delay for every query. If you mainly use the AI on your phone already, then the Wear OS version may be more of a limited novelty.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="gTkpyfbJXQDEEZgpK7BhoC" name="oneplus-watch-3-vs-google-pixel-watch-3" alt="Wearing a OnePlus Watch 3 and a Google Pixel Watch 3 on separate arms to compare them" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gTkpyfbJXQDEEZgpK7BhoC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The OnePlus Watch 3 is an example of a co-processor significantly improving the experience. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Gemini aside, I hope the M55 makes other background tasks more battery-efficient, similar to how the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-review">OnePlus Watch 3</a> lasts for days by running health and notifications through its upgraded BES2800 co-processor.</p><p>This leak suggests the Pixel Watch 4 41mm and 45mm will last 30 and 40 hours with AOD active, respectively, which significantly beats the Watch 3's 24-hour-with-AOD estimate. It's still nowhere close to OnePlus's option, but it's now ready to compete with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Samsung Galaxy Watch 8</a> for longevity.</p><p>Is the battery boost worth waiting for? Definitely for power users. But 30–40 hours still falls into that awkward window where you still need daily charging, because it'll die in the middle of day two — likely while you're at work.</p><p>Maybe with AOD turned off, the larger Watch 4 can be stretched to two full days; I'll have to test that in my review. But the point is, if you plan to charge your watch every night, the Watch 3 will easily last the full day, and cost you less. The Watch 4 just gives you wiggle room as the capacity fades over time.</p><h2 id="will-a-beefier-pixel-watch-4-design-work-for-you-2">Will a beefier Pixel Watch 4 design work for you?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4WQK9PfiUyFYyQ45s8mKLe" name="Pixel-Watch-renders-01" alt="Pixel Watch 4 renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4WQK9PfiUyFYyQ45s8mKLe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks/ via 91mobiles)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Unlike the controversial changes to the Galaxy Watch 8 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic-review">Watch 8 Classic</a>, the Pixel Watch 4 design should stick to the same style as always.

Aside from extra battery capacity, one leak suggests it will be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/pixel-watch-4-could-finally-tackle-whats-been-holding-googles-wearables-back">fully repairable</a>, unlike the older models that couldn't be disassembled to fix damaged components.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:832px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:72.12%;"><img id="GGErSKzdy6w5zz5cRgrv6b" name="pixel-watch-4-side-mounted-charging-leaked-example" alt="An alleged rendering of the Pixel Watch 4 sitting on its left side where its charging contact points have supposedly moved to." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GGErSKzdy6w5zz5cRgrv6b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="832" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That same leak suggests the Pixel Watch 4 could have satellite SOS capabilities if you don't have your phone on you. Fitting a functional antenna in there for emergencies might have thickened things up.</p><p>And one last leak this month showed the Pixel Watch 4's new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/google-pixel-watch-4-leaked-charging-cable-dock-rumor">side-mounted charging stand</a> in place of the current bottom charging pin system. The Watch 3's charging system works, but it's a bit finicky to get it attached; it'll be interesting to see if this version is an upgrade, whether in terms of speed or convenience.</p><p>We don't have official confirmation on any of this yet, but it's clear Google did its best to make the Pixel Watch 4 better... but may have had trouble squeezing everything into a rounded-edge frame that wasn't too thick.</p><h2 id="should-you-wait-for-the-pixel-watch-4-2">Should you wait for the Pixel Watch 4?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="zjwBhKDoU9EjwLba4uxJE3" name="Pixel-Watch-3-change-watch-face" alt="Changing a watch face on the Google Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zjwBhKDoU9EjwLba4uxJE3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>At this point, I think it makes sense to wait, even if you suspect the Pixel Watch 4 might not deliver everything you wanted. But not everyone should.</p><p>Google has the Pixel Watch 3 at $80 off, just off its all-time low from Prime Day ($250), and you can cut a little extra off that on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_watch_3?hl=en-US">Google Store</a> with a trade-in deal. But the current rumor is that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/looks-like-the-pixel-watch-4-wont-hit-your-wallet-as-hard-as-people-thought">Pixel Watch 4 will stick to its normal price</a>.</p><p>So you can easily quantify the decision now. Assuming these leaks are accurate, do you think it's worth $100 more to get an extra 5–10ish hours of battery life, a slightly larger and brighter display, a more convenient charger dock, faster Gemini commands, a couple of safety features, and one extra year of updates?</p><p>The Watch 3 is one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android watches</a> today, and the Watch 4 allegedly will have the same app speeds, storage, and health sensors; it'll also get Wear OS 6 in a couple of months. So there's no harm in grabbing one for cheap if you're not impressed with what the newer model has in store.</p> ]]></dc:content>

One important thing that most people overlook is that Apple didn't try to lie or hide anything.</p><p><strong>Epic Games did.</strong> And the appellate court decision even mentions it. Epic embedded extra code in Fortnite for Android to try to bypass Google Play Billing. That's a valid reason for getting kicked out, even if you don't agree with the rule saying you must use Google Play Billing.</p><p>Epic also tried to garner a special deal with both Google and Apple, where it would pay less than the standard 30% while outwardly calling the practice anti-competitive and illegal.</p><p><strong>Google also did.</strong> The company makes a point of being an open platform, but evidence shows it does plenty to stifle competition from other app distribution methods or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/epic-games-is-protesting-samsungs-anticompetitive-practices-but-users-are-the-ones-losing">make deals with phone makers to do the same</a>.</p><p>Making users change a setting to install third-party apps may be fine, but claiming you are friendly to the idea while finding ways to make it even harder doesn't sit well with a judge. Neither is trying to suppress evidence of it happening, but Google did both.</p><p><strong>Apple was just Apple.</strong> "Walled garden," "Apple's way or the highway," "total monopoly on devices running iOS," say it however you like. Apple says what it is and what it does, then doesn't try to hide any of it. In some cases, that's enough to satisfy a judge.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tyizFyyCo9bH2zWLakd4Yk" name="Court-gavel-lawsuits.jpg" alt="Court Gavel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tyizFyyCo9bH2zWLakd4Yk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another interesting tidbit that many people aren't mentioning is Epic Games' relationship with the Chinese state. In 2012, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.polygon.com/2013/3/21/4131702/tencents-epic-games-stock-acquisition/">Tencent bought 40% of Epic Games,</a> and Tencent has some interesting ties to the Chinese government, with the U.S. calling it a "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/united-states-adds-tencent-to-entity-list">Chinese Military company</a>". Does this matter to a U.S. judge? Probably not. Should this case end up in the current Supreme Court, that may change.</p><p>Finally, Microsoft may get what it has wanted for decades, a real foothold in the mobile world. Should third-party stores become the norm on Android, you can bet there will be one hell of an Xbox Games store where you pay for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/every-xbox-game-pass-android-game-available-right-now">Game Pass</a> and get every Microsoft app right beside the most popular Android apps from Google Play.

Epic Games and Tim Sweeney want more money. Google wants more money. Both companies want that money to come from you.</p><p>If you want to install apps that didn't come from Google Play, you probably already know how to do it. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/unknown-sources">There are instructions and tutorials everywhere</a>. If you just want to tap a button and install the apps and games from the store already installed on your phone, you can continue to do so. If you didn't have any opinion about it all or didn't even know, tech websites making a big deal over these trials and hearings isn't going to change that.</p><p>If all the appeals are lost and Google must do everything the courts have decided, Google will lose some of its ability to make money. Companies like Epic Games will have a new way to make money. You're still parting with the money either way. This case isn't going to give Tim Sweeney the kind of bank account that Musk or Bezos has. It also isn't going to turn Google into Nokia, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Decline-Fall-Nokia-David-Cord/dp/9515233208" target="_blank">so it can slowly die</a>. (That's a great book, by the way. Read it if you're a phone nerd.)</p><p>What could happen is you end up installing something without the same level of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-is-google-play-protect">user protections</a> you're used to having. This is one of Google's best arguments against things like adding third-party stores or sharing the Google Play app catalog. Epic Games (for example) may not be willing or able to spend the same amount of money that Google does policing the apps in its store. That's easily remedied if you pay attention, which all tech companies don't want you to do. Do it anyway.</p><h2 id="this-isn-t-over-2">This isn't over</h2><p>Expect to see more news about appeals, injunctions, stays, and new cases trickle in with the regularity we're used to. Some may have the potential to make a change that's better for us consumers, and others won't. Hopefully, when the dust settles, things are better than they used to be.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Following Samsung’s impressive Galaxy Z Fold 7, it feels like many people want the Pixel 10 Pro Fold to match its wow factor of “look how thin I am!” However, I really don’t think Google needs to worry about (or should even be thinking about) Samsung when it comes to its own foldables.</p><p>These days, my focus has been primarily on smaller flip phone foldables, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Motorola Razr</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-review">Galaxy Z Flip</a>. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-fold-changed-my-mind-about-foldables-but-i-still-prefer-flip-phones">my time with the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> showed me a whole new world and gave me an appreciation for larger-screened foldable phones. It’s slim, stylish, performs well, and is overall a fun device to use for anyone who prefers these types of foldables.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-fold">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a> is not likely to be much different from its predecessor as far as design goes, and following my experience with the 9 Pro Fold, this is perfectly fine, even if the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> is arguably the more exciting phone.

Meanwhile, both the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Honor Magic V5 are as thin or thinner than some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">high-end flagship smartphones</a>.</p><p>The difference in thickness between these two phones seems minuscule, especially with their large camera housings, and it makes Honor look a little ridiculous that it’s fighting so hard to retain its crown.</p><p>Then there’s the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>. It may not hold the crown for thinnest foldable in 2025, but it’s still pretty thin. In fact, Google touted it as the “thinnest foldable available,” with the caveat that it was only referring to phones in America. That’s nothing to sneeze at and still an impressive feat for a second-generation foldable.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="zJqhoAzS9Z47p72SjR3sSV" name="pixel-9-pro-fold-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-bottom-view-alt.jpg" alt="Pixel 9 Pro Fold and Galaxy Z Fold 6 bottom view comaprison" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zJqhoAzS9Z47p72SjR3sSV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Pixel 9 Pro Fold (left) and the Galaxy Z Fold 6 (right). </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Pixel 10 Pro Fold is rumored to have a nearly identical design, save for some changes in thickness and weight, and even some new color options. According to leaks, the foldable will measure roughly 5.2mm thick when unfolded, compared to the Pixel 9 Pro Fold’s 5.1mm. That’s a difference of .1mm when unfolded (roughly .3mm when folded), which, for a phone as large as this, seems hardly worth crying over.</p><p>If the Pixel 10 Pro Fold dimensions are to be believed, the phone would be roughly 2mm thicker than the Z Fold 7, but still about 2mm thinner than the outgoing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>. That still feels like a win to me, especially when you consider that Samsung’s phone still has a smaller battery than the Pixel 9 Pro Fold or its closest rival, the Honor Magic V5 with its massive 5,820mAh battery.</p><p>Not to mention everything else that Google may be packing into this phone.</p><h2 id="the-upgrades-that-matter-2">The upgrades that matter</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1410px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="UDmQwNgra4KCpxoDJ4CWEk" name="google-pixel-10-pro-fold-leaked-render-front-back" alt="A leaked look at the Pixel 10 Pro Fold rendering, showcasing its full internal display and rear panel." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UDmQwNgra4KCpxoDJ4CWEk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1410" height="793" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Leaked render of the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We’re just weeks away from the Pixel 10 Pro Fold launch, so there are plenty of leaks and rumors to go by, many of which seem pretty credible. Thus, we have a pretty good idea of what we can expect from Google’s next foldable, which may appear visually similar to its predecessor. It may not be a significant upgrade, but the biggest changes are expected to happen internally, and more than justify any potential increase in thickness when compared to the 9 Pro Fold and Galaxy Z Fold 7.</p><p>The first of those changes is a rumored increase in battery capacity. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold already has a larger battery than the Galaxy Z Fold 7 at 4,650mAh (versus 4,400mAh), but it’s rumored that the Pixel 10 Pro Fold will squeeze in a 5,015mAh battery. That’s a difference of nearly 600mAh compared to Samsung’s foldable, and I’m frankly okay with a slightly thicker phone if it means I can get more battery life.</p><p>I wasn’t a fan of Samsung giving the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review">Galaxy S25 Edge</a> a smaller battery than the base <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> to achieve its level of thinness. To me, shaving off a few millimeters doesn’t mean anything if you have to sacrifice a larger battery, particularly in a day and age when smartphones are doing so much more and demand more power. Sure, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold probably won’t win any thinness competitions, but the trade-off may be well worth it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1275px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:64.39%;"><img id="MMjBc85Fui37azvpDwp9sG" name="pixel-10-magsafe-charging-leak" alt="Leaked image of Pixel 10 showcasing Pixesnap MagSafe-like wireless charging" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MMjBc85Fui37azvpDwp9sG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1275" height="821" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Leaked image of Pixel 10 showcasing "Pixesnap" MagSafe-like wireless charging. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Evan Blass / X)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We’ve also seen leaks indicating that the Pixel 10 series may be the first Android flagship phones to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/will-the-google-pixel-10-support-qi2-magnetic-charging">support built-in Qi2 magnetic charging</a>. We’ve seen an image of what appears to be a base Pixel 10 with a “<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10-leak-shows-signs-of-magnetic-qi2-charging-finally-arriving">Pixelsnap</a>” accessory, indicating that a separate case may not be necessary. While we haven’t seen this on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, we can probably assume that this will also be included on the foldable, as it would be a pretty odd omission.</p><p>Adding Qi2 magnets to a phone likely <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/the-galaxy-z-fold-7-will-probably-launch-without-the-magnets-you-wanted-you-shouldnt-be-surprised">requires quite a bit of internal reworking</a>, so a bit of added thickness is likely one trade-off to adding a more convenient charging method. Another benefit to this is that it may increase wireless charging speeds from 8W on the 9 Pro Fold to a more respectable 15W.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BPAY9T9qMoxUh4BjGcnUMk" name="split-screen-apps-on-pixel-9-pro-fold.jpg" alt="Split-screen multitasking on Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BPAY9T9qMoxUh4BjGcnUMk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Lastly, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is rumored to be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/this-google-pixel-10-pro-fold-leak-is-as-good-as-it-gets">first foldable with an IP68 water and dust resistance rating</a>.

The Fold received its first price increase in years, bringing the price back up to $2,000. Granted, $1,799 was already a pretty penny to pay for a phone, and $2,000 is more than I pay for rent in Seattle, WA. Sure, you can chalk it up to “it’s just a $200 difference,” but think of what you could get for that $200, such as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/best-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-cases">Galaxy Z Fold 7 case</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/best-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-screen-protectors">screen protector</a>, and/or some other accessory.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is rumored to launch at the same $1,799 price tag as its predecessor. With that, you’ll likely get <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/is-googles-switch-from-samsung-foundry-to-tsmc-for-the-tensor-g5-chip-a-big-deal">a more capable processor</a>, faster and more convenient charging, a larger battery, and more. All of that in a phone that will probably be relatively thin and potentially more durable.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5284px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uQSNHarYqtCMB9R36fWydT" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review-9" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uQSNHarYqtCMB9R36fWydT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5284" height="2972" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If Google keeps the $1,799 price, then it’s already won in my eyes. The price of foldables is a major barrier for many consumers, and increasing the price doesn’t seem like the best way to attract more customers towards buying their first foldables. Sure, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-z-fold-7-just-broke-every-z-fold-preorder-record-ever-set-in-the-us">preorders of the Galaxy Z Fold 7 are up</a>, which is an impressive feat, but I imagine many of those are not first-time foldable owners, and you’d be hard-pressed to convince me to pay that much for a phone.</p><p>Yes $1,799 is still a lot of money, but it’s much more palatable when you’re still getting a good phone that does pretty much everything you need it to do. And when the options for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> in the United States are still quite limited, consumers will have to decide between the cheaper phone and the thinner one.

That’s a 55% decline compared to last quarter and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-q2-2024-earnings">almost the same year-over-year</a>.</p><p>Samsung says the big reason behind the decline is the delay in shipping high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips to Nvidia, along with U.S. tariffs affecting chip sales to China. While that was some grim news for the company, things picked up mid-earnings call as the company essentially confirmed that it will launch the most awaited XR headset, its first trifold, and the Galaxy S25 FE later this year.</p><p>The company is “preparing to introduce next-generation innovative products, including our XR headset and tri-fold smartphone this year.”</p><h2 id="ran-ban-meta-smart-glasses-triple-in-sales-and-its-earnings-soar-2">Ran-Ban Meta smart glasses triple in sales and its earnings soar</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="2yND8cCSEU6rnAt6pjbhjV" name="Ray-Ban-Stories-2023-with-logos-02.jpg" alt="Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses with logos and several different styles" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2yND8cCSEU6rnAt6pjbhjV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/metas-q2-earnings-continue-to-soar-as-ai-fuels-its-ad-revenue"><strong>here</strong></a></p><p>Meta reported its second-quarter earnings on Wednesday (July 30), and the company saw a 22% increase in its total revenue year over year, making $47.52 billion in Q2 alone.

The company made $10.4 billion in revenue, up 10% from the same period last year. Qualcomm's QCT division, which consists of its chipset sales, is what mostly contributed to its revenue. Headset sales experienced modest growth to $6.32 billion, while automotive and IoT saw larger 21% and 24% growth, respectively.</p><p>"Another quarter of strong growth in QCT Automotive and IoT revenues further validates our diversification strategy and confidence in achieving our long-term revenue targets," said Amon in a statement on Wednesday.</p><p>Even Qualcomm didn't shy away from making a big announcement to its investors listening in. During the call, Amon highlighted that the company also extended its partnership with Xiaomi to power multiple generations of devices for the massive Chinese market.</p><p>They noted that Xiaomi will be "the first OEM to launch with our next Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, which comes out over the next couple of months."</p><h2 id="this-pixel-10-leak-is-as-good-as-its-gets-2">This Pixel 10 leak is as good as its gets</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">pic.twitter.com/oJv38zaVFL<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1950291439570583746">July 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10-leak-shows-signs-of-magnetic-qi2-charging-finally-arriving"><strong>here</strong></a></p><p>Prominent tipster Evan Blass seems to be at it again, considering we're closing in on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a> series launch. This week, Blass posted a series of images on X, of the alleged Pixel 10 devices, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Pixel Watch 4</a>, as well as the Pixel Buds 2a.</p><p>These official-looking images don't just show off the products but also share the supposed specs of the phones. The leak reconfirms that the baseline Pixel 10 will include a triple-camera setup featuring a 48MP primary sensor, a 13MP ultra-wide lens, and, for the first time, a telephoto lens with up to 20x Super Res Zoom. Meanwhile, the Pixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL will retain their telephoto sensors but offer an upgraded "Pro Res Zoom" capability of up to 100x, among other things.</p><p>What's more interesting is that one of the images shows the alleged Pixel 10 connected to a magnetic charger snapped onto the back of a 10 device without a case, suggesting that the Pixel 10 series could be the first flagship Android phones to support MagSafe-like Qi2 magnetic charging natively.</p><p>That said, this isn't official until it comes from the source itself, which seems to be not too far away, as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-release-date">official unveiling</a> is just around the corner — Aug. 20.</p><h2 id="samsung-could-rejig-its-galaxy-s26-lineup-2">Samsung could rejig its Galaxy S26 lineup</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xbXvngxxSw7oAWHpToARUV" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-back-navy-iceblue-mint-02" alt="All four colors of the Samsung Galaxy S25" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xbXvngxxSw7oAWHpToARUV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-might-switch-things-up-with-its-galaxy-s26-lineup"><strong>here</strong></a></p><p>A new deep dive into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/one-ui-8-beta-3-rolls-out-for-galaxy-s25-and-galaxy-watches-see-their-first-beta">One UI 8's</a> build revealed that Samsung could be giving up on the standard Galaxy S26 for a new Galaxy S26 Pro.

Developers must also be allowed to share links that let users download apps outside of the Play Store and have full control over how they price their apps.</p><p>On top of that, Google can no longer pay phone makers, carriers, or developers for exclusivity or preinstallation deals.

Even though Epic CEO Tim Sweeney says the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/epic-games-store-telefonica-device-preload-partnered">Epic Games Store is on its way to the Play Store</a>, Google isn’t obligated to allow that for another eight months. So, third-party app stores likely won’t show up on Google Play until 2026 at the earliest.</p><p>Google’s stay request frames the situation as urgent, warning that the mandated changes could ripple across millions of users and hundreds of thousands of developers, not to mention Google’s own operations. The company argues that rushing these shifts could introduce serious risks and throw the stability of the entire Android ecosystem into question.</p><p>It’s still unclear if the Ninth Circuit will approve Google’s request for a stay, but one way or another, the company will have to open the door, either by hosting competing app stores on Google Play or giving them full access to its app lineup.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The publication's insight claims to have narrowed down the camera situation for the S25 FE. Supposedly, the device will feature a triple camera array again with a 50MP main sensor, 12MP ultrawide, and an 8MP telephoto. The selfie camera is reported as a 12MP lens with an f/2.2 aperture.</p><p>The internal information sheds light on the device's potential <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-exynos-2400-comeback">Exynos 2400</a>, which is a two-year-old chip by this point. However, these rumors paint a small downgrade for the S25 FE, stating it might give consumers a lower 4,500mAh capacity battery, instead of the same 4,900mAh capacity battery like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-hands-on">the S24 FE</a>.</p><p>Rumors purport Samsung will debut the S25 FE with two RAM/storage variations of 8/128GB and 8/256GB. One UI 8 (Android 16) is expected out of the box, and this is an interesting point, considering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s25-one-ui-8-beta-4-bug-fixes-patch-notes">Samsung just dropped Beta 4</a>. Hopefully, this signals testing is wrapping up soon.</p><p>The post reiterates some older rumors, such as the phone's probable 6.7-inch Dynamic AMOLED display and its thin 7.4mm measurement.</p><h2 id="this-could-be-next-2">This could be next</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9tt5ywyBytBzTTSuhuzeF8" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-2" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy S25 outdoors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9tt5ywyBytBzTTSuhuzeF8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There was a leak from early July that reported the Galaxy S25 FE's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s25-fe-wpc-listing-qi2-info-real-life-image-report">appearance at the WPC</a> for wireless charging certification. This report saw the device pick up the WPC's Qi2 wireless certification; however, the publication's rumors claim this will sit at 15W charging strength. This is a number that's in line with the rest of the S25 series. It's also worth pointing out that Samsung's S25 series <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-support-qi2-wireless-charging">requires a case to take advantage</a> of its wireless charging.</p><p>That WPC leak also showcased the device in a real-life photo. The device seemed to sport relatively thin bezels, but it notably lacked the black rings around its triple camera array. The flagship S25 series picked that up, which mirrored the Galaxy Z Fold 6.</p><p>Most recent developments not only saw the Fold 7 opt for silver rings, but it seems the S25 FE could do the same.</p><p>A potential launch is still up in the air, but rumors say the Galaxy S25 FE could join the Galaxy Tab S11 series <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/galaxy-tab-s11-series-launch-shortly-samsung-exec-comment-report">in September</a>.

This was in response to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/SladeBond/status/1950962134340252137">Ninth Circuit siding with Epic</a> this week. As a result, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1950968220833423451">Sweeney adds</a> that the Epic Games Store will soon debut on the Google Play Store.</p><p>Sweeney reiterates that Epic Games for Android is already available globally for users as a side-loadable app via its website. However, with it coming to the Play Store, users can have an easier time downloading it onto their phones and other devices.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/716856/epic-v-google-win-in-appeals-court">The Verge</a> chimed in with more details, stating the two areas the jury found Google guilty of illegally monopolizing were "Android app distribution" and "in-app billing." Moreover, the Ninth Circuit's decision this week is reportedly resuming a past injunction that would require Google to open its Play Store to third parties. Aside from Epic, the publication reports that the Google Play Store would have to "effectively open up its app store to competition for three whole years."</p><p>Not only will its "rivals" like Epic Games and others have the chance to show up on the Play Store, but Google would be "banned" from requiring apps to utilize its Play Billing service. It's this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/now-google-has-removed-fortnite-its-play-store">Play Store policy and grueling 15%-30% cut</a> for in-app purchases that has always been wrapped in Epic's arguments since day one.</p><h2 id="epic-wins-but-it-s-not-over-yet-2">Epic wins, but it's not over (yet)</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rMZRSpnnsvaDe8H7WhB49A" name="Epic-Games-Store-Mobile-Update" alt="A graphic for the Epic Games Store on mobile." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rMZRSpnnsvaDe8H7WhB49A.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Epic)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While Epic took a decisive victory over Google this week, The Verge received word from the latter that it would appeal the ruling. The publication says, "While Google did say it will appeal, it could possibly ask for an en banc review from the full Ninth Circuit first."</p><p>In 2024, Epic started <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/epic-games-store-telefonica-device-preload-partnered">rolling out its own store</a> for its games on Android and iOS following the removal of Fortnite from those areas. The fight then included Samsung as big tech companies started incorporating anti-competitive features, such as the Korean OEM's "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/epic-sues-google-and-samsung-anti-competitive-case">Auto Block</a>" feature, which reportedly heavily deterred users from third parties.</p><p>This was essentially wrapped in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/epics-free-games-program-is-coming-to-the-epic-games-store-on-android">the sideloading policies</a> companies enforced on their systems. Earlier this year, Epic made a statement, saying, "So far none of the 100 highest grossing mobile game developers are willing to distribute their games on the Epic Games Store because of the Core Technology Fee and Apple and Google’s onerous restrictions and scare screens." Alongside these scare tactics, users attempting to sideload—take the Epic Game Store, for instance—are met with a series of system prompts.</p><p>These <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-is-making-it-harder-to-sideload-apps-on-android">prompts are often lengthy</a>, forcing users to go through upwards of 12 to 15 steps just to install the Epic Game Store. Following the Ninth Circuit's ruling and the store's availability within the Play Store, this should be much simpler for users.</p> ]]></dc:content>

But the opposite is usually the case, and that includes the Galaxy Z Fold 7.

You might let someone share your phone once in a while, but chances are it's yours alone and chock full of important information that you need to keep at hand. Since a lot of other people would love to have access to that information, too, keeping it for your eyes only is critical.</p><p>You might think you have nothing worth any sort of protection. A lot of people think that way, but it's simply not true. You've probably seen those late-night commercials about identity theft because it happens to all types of people; you don't have to be rich for someone to try to get a loan in your name. Besides that, you probably have other things you'd like to keep a little private. Medical information, financial information, that sort of stuff.</p><p>This is why Google's latest effort for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-is-making-chrome-autofill-a-little-less-risky-on-android">password protection on Chrome</a> will go a long way.</p><h2 id="keep-the-important-stuff-secure-2">Keep the important stuff secure</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="7jsJtrk8uSt8Yv9sfM4cLm" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-hazel-display-fingerprint-sensor-02.jpg" alt="An up-close look at the new in-display ultrasonic fingerprint sensor on the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7jsJtrk8uSt8Yv9sfM4cLm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The sad reality is that it's super easy to get to all this when your phone is in my hands. It doesn't have to be; you can set things up so your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/pixel-phones-are-having-a-fit-with-their-lock-screens-thanks-to-android-16">phone is locked every time the screen goes off</a>, but there are all sorts of ways to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/smart-lock">make things more convenient</a>, thus keeping everything up, running, and ready for anyone to see. Most people choose the convenient way because they interact with their phone hundreds (thousands?) of times per day.</p><p>The trick is finding a way to keep things easy to use while protecting some stuff from others. Google <em>finally</em> got the message with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-add-a-google-password-manager-shortcut-to-your-home-screen">Chrome Password manager</a>, and soon it will require you to use your fingerprint or another way to authenticate who you are before it automatically offers to fill in passwords. It's a little late, but better than never.</p><p>We need more of this. And no, things like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-enable-and-use-locked-folder-google-photos">locked folders</a> that you have to set up in advance aren't the way to do it. Your fingertip is.</p><p>To be honest, I'm torn on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-galaxy-s24-might-have-faster-fingerprint-unlocks-with-one-ui-7-beta">using your fingerprint as a password</a>. To me, your fingerprint is who you are, and more like a username that you can never change. But my unpopular opinion doesn't matter because it's a bajillion times easier than entering a password on a tiny keyboard. Since it's become the norm, though, it's time to use it for anything and everything that's remotely important.</p><h2 id="more-options-are-better-2">More options are better</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="h2oNLkGAXdqmXnmCCkZs7W" name="Motorola-Razr-2024-review-01.jpg" alt="Apps on the Motorola Razr 2024 cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h2oNLkGAXdqmXnmCCkZs7W.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Let's say, for example, you use Google Photos. The app comes with a "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-enable-and-use-locked-folder-google-photos">Locked Folder</a>" feature, but requires you to set it before you use it. It's great that it's there, and I'm not saying that they should remove it in favor of something global, just that a lot of people don't even know about it or will never bother.</p><p>What if, instead, when you first used the app, it gave you the option to require your fingerprint to see your photos and instead offered a public folder that anyone can see? If you don't care, just say no. If you do care, it only takes a second to press on the screen or the <em>much</em> better side button some phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Moto Razr</a> use.</p><p>Now apply this logic to everything.</p><p>This is a platform-level task, and while phone makers like Samsung could implement it (Samsung was early to the party with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-set-samsungs-secure-folder-galaxy-s8">secured folders and storage spaces</a>), this needs to come from Google and Apple. A "simple" layer that sits in between the OS and an app can handle all of it, so we won't have to depend on app developers for any of it.</p><p>I know this is wishful thinking on my part, and if anything resembling this happens, it will be in a distant future, but it's still something I'd like to see. Options are good and we love them, provided they're presented well. One more can't hurt, right?</p> ]]></dc:content>

It's also worth noting that this particular deal is for the 256GB storage option in the Pantone Deep Forest color.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$549.99" data-dimension48="$549.99" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/motorola-edge-2025-256gb-unlocked-pantone-deep-forest/6624976.p" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="HGSNsz96xFxi7JgSBj43z3" name="motorola edge 2025 square render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HGSNsz96xFxi7JgSBj43z3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="800" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Motorola Edge 2025 (256GB):</strong> <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/motorola-edge-2025-256gb-unlocked-pantone-deep-forest/6624976.p" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$549.99" data-dimension48="$549.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$549.99</del> <strong>$449.99 at Best Buy</strong></a></p><p>Best Buy's <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/best-buy-back-to-school-deals-2025">2025 Back-to-School sale</a> brings with it a $100 discount on the latest-gen Motorola Edge, which is our favorite Motorola phone overall.

With that being said, the Edge includes a nice 6.7-inch pOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate, 8GB of RAM, and Android 15 OS. It also has three rear cameras, including a telephoto, ultrawide, and a regular PDAF lens, as well as a front PDAF lens. The 5,200mAh battery offers pretty excellent battery life, and the Edge also has 68W fast charging.</p><p>It's also worth pointing out that this phone only comes with two OS updates, so if that's a dealbreaker for you, it may be worth looking elsewhere.</p> ]]></dc:content>

DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis said back then that it’s built on “the latest cutting-edge research,” giving the model the ability to weigh multiple ideas at once before landing on a response.</p><p>Even after scoring big on the 2025 U.S. Math Olympiad, Google decided to run more safety checks and get expert input.

Unlike the original, which could take hours to crack tough problems, this version is tuned for everyday tasks, but still holds its own with a Bronze-level score in internal IMO tests.</p><h2 id="strong-benchmark-results-show-deep-think-s-potential-2">Strong benchmark results show Deep Think's potential</h2><p>While the search giant did not share much about how Deep Think is built, it’s thought to work a lot like OpenAI’s o1-pro and o3-pro models, using some kind of engine to find and piece together the best solutions to a problem.</p><p>Gemini 2.5 Deep Think raises the bar for models that work without external tools.

The most recent rumor gives us official looking renders of the budget Pixel Buds, in the Iris colorway, similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a">Pixel 9a. </a></p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/google-pixel-buds-2a">Android Headlines</a> also notes that these buds could be a follow up to the original Pixel Buds A -Series. Reliable leaker Arsène Lupin posted some<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MysteryLupin/status/1940848330839654705" target="_blank"> details on X</a>, and they suggest that Google may be mixing things up with Pixel Buds' 2a colors.  As it these Buds may also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/pixel-buds-2a-colors-might-not-look-anything-like-the-ones-weve-seen-before">show up three other colors:</a> Strawberry, Fog Light, and Hazel.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RwXMrQQwYcf57vPZwFZbn6" name="Pixel-Buds-2a" alt="Pixel Buds 2a -Iris" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RwXMrQQwYcf57vPZwFZbn6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That said, the renders show the Pixel Buds 2a inside the signature oval case, however it looks like the insides of the case could also get a splash of color to match the Buds placed in them. If you look closer at the renders,  you can notice that they have new microphone cutouts, suggesting that Google could finally bring ANC to these buds, a step up from its predecessor.</p><p>In terms of design, the renders show that these buds will stick to its predecessors' overall look, showcasing in-ear rounded buds, without a steam, placed in an oval charging case. However, Google could make some minor changes to its design so that it better fits the user's ear.</p><p>As for the Pixel Buds 2a's battery life, the website notes that it could get a boost when compared to the original budget earbuds, and it might also come with enhanced sound quality. While there's not much information on pricing, Google might sell these new earbuds in line with its budget offering, but since it could have ANC, and other new features, they might slightly up the price a bit.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">pic.twitter.com/oJv38zaVFL<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1950291439570583746">July 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>The Pixel Buds 2a aren't the only earbuds that could show up at this year's Made by Google. The other leaks claim that the Pixel Buds Pro 2 will also see two new colorways: Moonstone and Sterling.

However, the wait isn't for much long as Google is set to reveal its next flagship series on August 20, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/made-by-google-2025-how-to-watch-pixel-10-launch-and-what-to-expect">we expect that the Pixel Buds 2a and Buds 2 Pro</a> could be revealed during the same event.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This exact line was delivered nearly verbatim in both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/metas-q2-earnings-continue-to-soar-as-ai-fuels-its-ad-revenue">Q2 2025 earnings</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/meta-q1-2025-earnings-show-major-ai-priority-shift-ray-ban-success">Q1 2025 earnings</a> calls, and it likely cements a shift in consumer interest that we've been seeing since Meta revamped the Quest Store last Summer.</p><p>From what we know, the next 6-12 months are going to be huge for Meta's Reality Labs division. We're expecting another pair of Oakley Meta smart glasses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oakley-meta-smart-glasses-teaser">based on the Sphaera style</a>, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-gen-3">third generation of Ray-Ban Meta Smart glasses</a>, and the company's first pair of commercially available smart glasses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-next-gen-ray-ban-hypernova-glasses-semg-bracelet-render-leaks">with a screen in the lenses</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Quest 4 has been reportedly "canceled" in favor of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/the-quest-4-might-slip-to-2027-but-meta-could-unveil-a-lighter-model-next-year-instead">a radical new design</a> that is supposed to look a lot more like goggles than a traditional VR headset. Since we don't expect this Quest until at least the end of 2026, all hopes are riding on smart glasses to continue to push Meta's XR hardware revenue toward continually better places, especially when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a>'s launch is right around the corner.</p><h2 id="things-aren-t-going-as-planned-2">Things aren't going as planned</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="AQv5XxMxUoFaFuJssqTaSk" name="meta-quest-3-controller-playing" alt="Holding a Meta Quest 3 controller while playing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AQv5XxMxUoFaFuJssqTaSk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's clear that Meta's Quest ambitions aren't going as planned. While the Quest 2 was a dramatic entry into the market <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/quest-2-units-sold-spring-2022">that outsold the Xbox</a>, the Quest 3 line hasn't seen the same level of success. We don't know what the exact sales numbers are for the Quest 3, but many Quest 3 exclusive games have lower player counts than their Quest 2-compatible counterparts, and Meta's admission of lower-than-expected sales also helps reveal that reality.</p><p>The company revamped the Quest store (now called the Horizon Store since it'll eventually be available on non-Quest-branded VR headsets) last Summer, allowing indies to jump straight to the main listings instead of being kept in the App Lab section. Meta has also been more transparent with developers this year, offering up important insights like how to develop <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developers.meta.com/horizon/blog/optimize-user-time-goldilocks-session-length-meta-quest/">for the "Goldilocks" session time</a> and suggestions <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/the-good-and-bad-of-meta-quest-growth-in-2024">to push for free-to-play content</a>.</p><p>All of this shows that Meta's initial push for big, long AAA-quality games like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/asgards-wrath-2-review">Asgard's Wrath 2</a> didn't pan out, but similar titles with big names like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/batman-arkham-shadow-review">Batman Arkham Shadow</a> and the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/vr-games/marvels-deadpool-vr-hands-on">Deadpool VR</a> show more promise. Plus, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-xbox-edition">hardware partnership with Xbox</a> has driven a lot of eyes to the Quest brand among gamers, with the Xbox Meta Quest 3S selling out at Meta's website in a matter of days.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="omh5CKpghxiJEViVQUnMUM" name="meta-quest-3s-xbox-edition-official-render-bundle-01" alt="An official product render of the Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition bundle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/omh5CKpghxiJEViVQUnMUM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Microsoft / Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>However, maybe more importantly to the company's current goals, AI glasses have proven to be a hit with consumers. As of February 2025, Meta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/metas-ray-ban-smart-glasses-are-a-hit-and-its-now-planning-a-massive-production-ramp-up">sold over 2 million Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses</a> and has ramped up production to sell 10 million a year. Considering these glasses sell for as much as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-review">Meta Quest 3S</a>, on average, and cost a lot less to manufacture, there's reason for Meta and its investors to get excited about 2025.</p><p>The recently released Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/i-found-oakley-meta-hstns-hidden-superpower-for-athletes">substantially improved image stabilization</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oakley-meta-hstn-smart-glasses-battery-life-review">better battery life</a>, and we're expecting even more improvements from the rest of Meta's fall 2025 smart glasses lineup. The company just invested another $3.5 billion into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/meta-takes-around-3-stake-ray-ban-parent-essilorluxottica-source-says-2025-07-08/">EssilorLuxottica</a>, the parent company behind Ray-Ban and Oakley, with plans to invest even more as both companies release more smart glasses.</p><p>But while AI glasses have taken off, I don't believe for a minute that Meta expected to have such success. Meta AI wasn't ready for the initial October 2023 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses</a> launch and didn't even publicly launch until April 2024. At that point, it felt like the product transformed into something completely different, and the sales reflected that over the course of 2024.</p><h2 id="where-do-we-go-from-here-2">Where do we go from here?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="C3p87vPFtdpqnkvCohggH7" name="meta-vr-glasses-prototype-2025" alt="An ultra-thin VR headset prototype Meta developed in cooperation with an associate professor at Stanford and a Stanford PhD student" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C3p87vPFtdpqnkvCohggH7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1151" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta / Nature Photonics)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Over the years, a common complaint about VR headsets is that they're too big, too heavy, and too "dorky looking," for lack of a nicer term. While many people have no problem wearing a VR headset, there's still a social stigma that comes with having something that large on your head.</p><p>So Meta has pushed to make its VR headsets look more like glasses, and several new prototypes (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/meta-stanford-synthetic-aperture-waveguide-holography-vr-glasses-research/">via UploadVR</a>) give us an idea of what to expect. Something like what you see above is what Meta spends a whole lot of money every quarter developing, and while it's still several years away, the company's investment in the AR/VR industry is helping it deliver commercially available products ahead of the competition.</p><p>Even if this particular vision of a standalone glasses-like form factor is still several years out, the current crop of rumors points to the Meta Quest 4 looking more like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Meta Orion</a> smart glasses than the current Quest headset design. That seems like a far better way to deliver mixed reality and virtual reality gaming to consumers who don't like traditional VR headset designs and is a real sign of things to come.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jriGiXXyBox8gzXnTUD28B" name="meta-ray-ban-smart-glasses-hypernova-mockup" alt="A mockup of what Meta Hypernova smart glasses could look like using transparent Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jriGiXXyBox8gzXnTUD28B.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Ultimately, the intersection between regular glasses and a VR headset is where Meta is headed for the next few years. "Puffin," the current project hardware that's believed to become the Meta Quest 4, is essentially a pair of smart goggles that weigh less than 100g and have all the battery and computing technology in a pocketable iPod-like device.</p><p>Compare that to the current Quest 3, which weighs just over 500g, and you'll understand the difference this is going to make. Until that happens in late 2026 or early 2027, though, Meta is going to be sending a barrage of smart glasses in multiple form factors and price tags to see what sticks.</p><p>Will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-with-display-rumor" target="_blank">Meta Hypernova</a>, with its single-lens display and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-semg-wristband-whitepaper" target="_blank">sEMG gesture bracelet</a>, catch on at a smartphone price level, or are consumers mainly interested in these glasses because they don't cost much more than a normal pair of Ray-Bans? We'll find out in less than 12 months, that's for sure.</p> ]]></dc:content>

According to its information, the S26 Edge may receive a battery upgrade with a modest 300mAh capacity increase over the 2025 edition. For reference, the S25 Edge features a 3,900 mAh battery with 25W charging.</p><p>If the leak is accurate, the S26 Edge could see a 4,200mAh battery.

This rumor was two-pronged, as the report claimed this bigger battery was the result of new "battery materials" that Samsung was looking into implementing. Additionally, those same rumors said the S26 Edge was going to be "even thinner" than its 5.8mm profile this year.</p><p>These new battery material rumors could either reference Samsung's rumored <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-future-galaxy-s-phones-battery-charging-rumors">silicon-carbon route</a> or a more recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-sus-battery-tech-galaxy-s26-rumors">SUS CAN report</a>. The latter was detailed to offer a "significant" boost to a device's battery density while also improving its charging capabilities. We're still pretty far from a Galaxy S26 series debut, so this is all just food for thought right now.</p><p>Speaking of, the Galaxy S26 series might look a little different as a rumor claims Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-might-switch-things-up-with-its-galaxy-s26-lineup">could drop the base model for a Pro</a>. If true, then the series would look like this: Galaxy S26 Pro, Galaxy S26 Edge, and Galaxy S26 Ultra. The Galaxy S Plus model would also get benched for Samsung's newer Edge ambitions, should this rumor be believed. That said, the series is expected to rock <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-2">Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite 2</a> next year, with One UI 8.5 (Android 16) out of the box.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Instead of physically going into your ear canal with an ear tip, the Moto Buds Loop are more like a tiny speaker that sits right outside your ear. Open earbuds have a few advantages, such as the ability to hear ambient noise and less pressure and discomfort, but they will feel much different than <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">traditional wireless earbuds</a>.</p><p>I've tried open earbuds that have an ear hook wrapping around your ear, and I'm a huge fan of ear hooks in general, even on traditional earbuds like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/beats-powerbeats-pro-2-review">Powerbeats Pro 2</a>. By comparison, the Moto Loop Buds clip straight onto your earlobe for a secure fit like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bose-ultra-open-earbuds-review">Bose Ultra Open earbuds</a>.</p><p>This was my first time trying open earbuds of this style, and I came away impressed. Once you put them on and adjust their fit, the Moto Loop Buds stay in place. There isn't a lot of clamping force, and there's some give in the Loop Buds that lets you pull them apart gently to place them on your ear.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XcPkKzfQSPdj8B3m9QA333" name="Moto-Buds-Loop-Review-7" alt="The Moto Buds Loop in PANTONE French Oak with Swarovski crystals." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XcPkKzfQSPdj8B3m9QA333.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I ran a few 5Ks with the Moto Loop Buds instead of the Powerbeats Pro 2, and in some ways, these Motorola earbuds were better. I had to adjust their position less while running and was more aware of my surroundings thanks to the open design, which allows ambient noise to reach my ears.</p><p>When you wear the Moto Loop Buds, they look a lot like earrings. The version I reviewed with Swarovski crystals doubles down on that look, and I like it. Though I've never worn earrings before, I think they look pretty good on me. They're simultaneously a loud piece of jewelry and a subtle pair of earbuds.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KCxFpvMSEkSMEfKNGtSM23" name="Moto-Buds-Loop-Review-8" alt="The Moto Buds Loop in PANTONE French Oak with Swarovski crystals." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KCxFpvMSEkSMEfKNGtSM23.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>At the heart of the Moto Buds Loop are dual 12mm ironless drivers, which are on the large side for earbuds.</p><p>In terms of sound, the Moto Buds Loop are about as good as open earbuds can be. I mentioned how the open design lets ambient sound in, but that works both ways. The sound created by these earbuds also goes out, and there's no seal or sound isolation present. That means they may not sound as loud or as bass-heavy as earbuds you're used to, although this is true of every pair of open earbuds.</p><p>With that in mind, the volume offered by the Moto Buds Loop was more than enough for my needs. The bass wasn't outstanding by any means, and there were a few bass-centric tracks that sounded silly with open earbuds, but those songs were the exception rather than the norm.</p><p>By default, the earbuds are set to the <strong>Bass boost</strong> equalizer preset to try and compensate. The EQ can be changed in the Moto Buds app, which works with any Android device. You can also enable dual connection, gaming mode, and change button shortcuts.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TWfMMKFFKnyvS4A8WBbBB3" name="Moto-Buds-Loop-Review-11" alt="The Moto Buds Loop in PANTONE French Oak with Swarovski crystals." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TWfMMKFFKnyvS4A8WBbBB3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Moto Loop Buds case is slightly larger than most traditional earbuds.

When using the Moto Buds Loop with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-review">Motorola Razr 2025</a>, the experience feels completely different compared to using these earbuds with a non-Motorola phone.</p><p>Spatial audio is only available with a Motorola handset, and that's a shame. The feature is mostly standard on earbuds in this price point, across devices and operating systems. Additionally, the <strong>Crystal Talk</strong> feature that uses AI to cancel out noise during a phone call is a Motorola exclusive. The spatial audio tool is particularly handy, as it combines with the open feel of the earbuds to create a more immersive experience.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uoNoWfktbGjyMYzABxDSF4" name="Moto-Buds-Loop-Review-3" alt="The Moto Buds Loop in PANTONE French Oak with Swarovski crystals." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uoNoWfktbGjyMYzABxDSF4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another gripe I have with the Moto Buds Loop is their on-earbud buttons. There's one button for each earbud, which isn't enough to handle volume control, playback control, and toggling voice assistants. Play/pause and previous/next work easily enough, but needing to triple-press the earbuds for volume control is annoying. If you need to drastically adjust the volume, you might need to press an earbud 10 to 15 times total.</p><p>During that process, the earbuds might misinterpret you trying to adjust the volume as trying to skip or restart the song, which can be frustrating.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yzHVreBNu2M7aRNdQ6zhu" name="Moto-Buds-Loop-Review-9" alt="The Moto Buds Loop case on a table." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yzHVreBNu2M7aRNdQ6zhu.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Finally, there is a learning curve to putting on the Moto Buds Loop.

Once you figure it out, it's not as hard, but they're still not my favorite earbuds to put on. The good news is, you only have to do it once, and the rest of your listening session is comfy.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-moto-buds-loop-competition"><span>Moto Buds Loop: Competition</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GHgwZHRQxikgWC2Bp985DM" name="bose-ultra-open-earbuds-outdoor-lifestyle.jpeg" alt="Bose Ultra Open Earbuds on a railing." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GHgwZHRQxikgWC2Bp985DM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Bose Ultra Open earbuds might be Motorola's biggest competitor.  </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Motorola's open earbuds are priced with the best of them, including the Bose Ultra Open earbuds.

To break things down, YouTube begins by stating its protections are AI-based. It adds that its AI software utilizes a "variety of signals" to help determine whether or not a user is under 18 or over.</p><p>The kinds of "signals" YouTube's AI looks for include the type of videos you're searching for, video categories you've watched, and the longevity of your account. If YouTube's AI deems an account to be under the age of 18, it will put forth a few limiters.</p><p>YouTube states such accounts will have their digital wellbeing tools activated, a limit set on "repetitive views" for "some kinds of content," and personalized advertising will be deactivated. Considering AI can get things wrong, YouTube states users can either use a credit card or their government-issued ID to prove they're above 18. Only a small set of U.S.-based users will see YouTube's AI-based protections for younger users roll out in the next few weeks.</p><p>The company states it will monitor this before expanding its availability.</p><h2 id="the-guidelines-change-2">The Guidelines Change</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Fm9BFBYs92bPuYnziBKnnk" name="Google-Pixel-8-Pro-youtube-app.jpg" alt="The YouTube app listing on the Google Play Store, running on a Google Pixel 8 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Fm9BFBYs92bPuYnziBKnnk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>YouTube's platform will also see a change <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXtVRYCYp5M&ab_channel=CreatorInsider">to how it handles profanity</a> present in content creators' videos (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/07/30/youtube-new-profanity-guidelines-utilizes-ai-identify-teens/">9to5Google</a>).

Samsung states it's been upgraded to be roughly seven times faster than before, meaning users can capture moments in action easier. The post highlights the Z Fold 7's "Dual Camera Depth Calibration," which helps to determine the distance you are from your subject, "intelligently" switching between the 200MP lens and the 12MP ultra-wide camera.</p><p>Even the selfie camera received some improvements for its 100-degree field of view. Over the Fold 6, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">the Fold 7's</a> selfie camera provides a 25% wider photo that's reportedly five times clearer. Other upgrades include improved skin texture in photos, enhanced HDR processing, and AI-powered filters.</p><p>Samsung's Fold 7 filters go hand-in-hand with its Generative Edit and Suggest Erases features, fueled by Galaxy AI. Regarding Generative Edit, Samsung says its AI software updates have reduced its misgeneration rate and texture distortion.</p><h2 id="the-fold-7-struts-its-stuff-2">The Fold 7 struts its stuff</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4936px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="PP647NPFc5nG6kjh2Hi6qS" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-camera-3" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 sticking up through a bush" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PP647NPFc5nG6kjh2Hi6qS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4936" height="2777" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Videos on the Fold 7 take off with Samsung's 10-bit HDR recording capabilities. The post states this brings a "four times richer contrast and wider dynamic range." Additionally, the Fold 7 supports LOG video recordings, which should come in handy for creators (like vloggers) who enter the post-production phase for editing purposes and more.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Fold 7 has been catching a lot of attention this year, most likely due to its advancements for a slimmer build, AI, and other notable upgrades. The device has most recently been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-finally-pulls-ahead-of-the-flip-in-sales-in-korea">reported to have surpassed the Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> in South Korean pre-orders. While the Flip 7 is typically the model consumers go for, the Fold 7 now accounts for 60% of the pre-order pie in Samsung's home country. And, a few hours ago today (July 31), the Fold 7 was reported to have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-z-fold-7-just-broke-every-z-fold-preorder-record-ever-set-in-the-us">been a hit in the U.S. market, too</a>.</p><p>For the U.S., the Fold 7's pre-order rate crushed the Flip 7, selling 50% faster than ever before. Carriers are also reporting an extreme surge in pre-orders for the Fold 7, and people are supposedly showing up more in person in stores to purchase it.</p><p>Samsung Display got in on the Fold 7 hype, discussing what it did to create <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-says-galaxy-z-fold-7-screen-decade-long-durability-report">a stronger folding screen</a>. The division states the Fold 7's new foldable technology should keep going "even after" 500,000 folds, which, for the average person, would last them a decade.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="c6c66652-0b38-45c6-932f-33ff296a3ef2">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n492cdTmAtXoxYWXC3iyrB.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>With Samsung's 3rd generation Armor FlexHinge, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is 27% slimmer, and around 43% lighter.

The watch also comes with all of the latest health and fitness tracking features from Fitbit, while features like Workout builder and Cardio Load make it the perfect tool for runners.</p><p>Of course, no smartwatch is <em>truly </em>perfect, and the Pixel Watch 3 does have a few issues that you should consider before making a purchase.
