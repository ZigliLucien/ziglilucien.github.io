Make sure to <a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=androidcentral.com" target="_blank"><strong>set Android Central as a preferred source</strong></a> in Google Search, and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should"><strong>find out why you should</strong></a> so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>If you thought Motorola's G 2026 was the final hoorah, you'd be mistaken, as the brand is announcing a mid-range to take you into the new year.</p><p>Right in the midst of the holidays, we have the new Moto G Power 2026 to get ourselves ready for the brand's next generation of mid-ranges. In a press release, Motorola states that its latest G Power was built with speed in mind to keep up with your wild digital (and daily) life. Set for a January 8 market debut with a $299 price, the Moto G Power 2026 features a flat 6.8-inch FHD Plus display. Motorola builds on this with 120Hz refresh rate support and up to 1,000nits of peak brightness.</p><p>Another area Motorola sought to expand upon was the phone's durability. Specifications list 14 MIL-STD-810H resilience, capable of withstanding "drops, temperature extremes, and humidity." For the screen, Motorola leveraged Corning Gorilla Glass 7i, as well as an IP68 and IP69 rating for water protection.</p><p>Bringing the speed and reliability that Motorola claims the G Power is capable of is MediaTek's Dimensity 6300 SoC. It's worth mentioning that this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-moto-g-power-2025-and-moto-g-2025-launch">is the same chip</a> that empowered the G Power 2025 earlier this year.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4127px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="Cw5q9qAyrM66rAU8Cxk3iE" name="moto-g-power-2026-cashmere-color" alt="Motorola G Power 2026 in a Cashmere color beside an iced coffee on a cream-colored table." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Cw5q9qAyrM66rAU8Cxk3iE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4127" height="2321" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Flip the G Power over to find its dual-camera array inside a square housing. The design is pretty similar to what Motorola brought with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-power-2025-review">G Power 2025 edition</a>. Leading the duo is the main shooter: a 50MP lens with Quad Pixel Technology and OIS (optical image stabilization). In tandem, Moto states the device is capable of capturing your memories in greater detail. Flanking the 50MP is an 8MP ultrawide, macro vision lens combo.</p><p>The display houses the 32MP selfie camera. Motorola's photography-focused AI continues with Auto Night Vision, Auto Smile Capture, and Shot Optimization.</p><p>The AI features roll on with Google's involvement through Gemini and Circle to Search. Consumers will grab Android 16 with the Moto G Power 2026, alongside "Smart Connect." Motorola states Smart Connect lets users quickly transfer files and sync experiences. The company itself adds Moto Secure, Unplugged, Family Space, ThinkShield, and Hello UX.</p><h2 id="raise-a-brow-at-this-budget-phone-2">Raise a brow at this budget phone</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4127px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="o3grd5DRyFtatins6BKDmM" name="moto-g-power-2026-cashmere-evening-blue-options" alt="The Motorola G Power 2026 in its Cashmere and Evening Blue color options." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o3grd5DRyFtatins6BKDmM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4127" height="2321" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Internal hardware specifications include a 5,200mAh battery that Motorola claims can sustain users for roughly two days. Battery Care helps users keep tabs on its health, as well as providing tracking support for optimized performance. Motorola combined this battery with 30W charging to deliver "hours of use" in a few minutes. The phone's 8GB of RAM helps with switching tabs and the demands of other key uses. The company highlights its AI-powered RAM Boost for up to 16GB of virtual RAM for "speed and responsiveness."</p><p>As previously stated, the Moto G Power 2026 will be available on January 8 for $299. The device is featured in two colors: PANTONE Pure Cashmere and PANTONE Evening Blue. Consumers can find the device on Best Buy, Amazon, and motorola.com when the time comes. Those in Canada can expect the phone to launch with a $449 price tag.</p> ]]></dc:content>

There’s now a new plus (+) button in the Search bar that does more than just handle keywords and nudges you into using generative AI.</p><p>If you’ve ever wanted Google to look at your document or photo and explain what’s inside, this update moves things closer to that. When you click the plus sign, a dropdown menu appears with two options: "Upload image" and "Upload file” (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/12/15/google-search-plus-menu/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>After you choose one of these options, you go straight into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-tests-experimental-ai-mode">AI Mode</a>. Here, Google’s generative models review your upload and give you summaries, explanations, or answers based on what’s in the file.</p><h2 id="it-s-a-direct-shortcut-to-ai-mode-2">It’s a direct shortcut to AI Mode</h2><p>This feature isn’t completely new. Google already allows file uploads in AI Mode. The main change is that it’s now easier to find. Google obviously wants people to see that Search is more than just typing questions.</p><p>For a long time, Google Search has focused on keywords. You type a question, Google searches the web, and you get links. That approach is still there, but now there’s more to it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1093px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:54.16%;"><img id="BJ9pSK9MZga2pebfRxubzF" name="AI-Mode-plus-button" alt="AI Mode in search showing a plus button for uploading images and files" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BJ9pSK9MZga2pebfRxubzF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1093" height="592" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Over the past year, Google has been reshaping Search to feel more like a conversation than a list of links. Features like AI Overviews and a standalone AI Mode are part of that shift, and recent experiments show <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-just-made-searching-on-mobile-a-lot-more-chatty">Google is focused on cutting down the steps it takes to get there</a>.</p><p>The new plus button fits right into that goal, pulling file uploads out of hidden menus and placing them front and center in the Search bar, where AI-powered analysis feels like a natural starting point instead of an extra option.</p><p>While the interface doesn't scream artificial intelligence right off the bat, uploading a file via this new menu immediately initiates a conversation with Google’s multimodal chatbot.</p><h2 id="desktop-first-for-now-2">Desktop first for now</h2><p>Currently, the new plus menu is showing up for many desktop web users, even in Incognito mode, but it’s not on mobile browsers yet. This is probably on purpose. Desktop users often upload PDFs, documents, or screenshots, so it’s a safer way for Google to see how people use this feature.</p><p>Here’s hoping this feature also comes to mobile next, where searching with your camera or images already feels normal.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This is wrapped in the company's Search Labs experimental environment. The Labs description for the feature reads, "make your Discover feed truly yours by saying what you want to see." It seems Google is fueling it with a heavy dose of AI to not only adhere to the user's request, but to hunt down that specific content.</p><p>Once you get down to it, "Tailor your Feed" is pretty receptive about what the user wants to see—and what it doesn't want to see, too.</p><p>There's a basic text box for the user to type their content preferences for the Google app's Discover feed. Once done, the fine print says "you'll be able to review before making changes." However, Google's early test shows that it's planning to offer a few suggestions, such as "stop showing me negative news." There were other suggestions listed, like "keep me updated on country music," which alludes to the AI briefly glancing over what's currently offered in your feed.</p><p>Once your prompt is in, "Tailor your feed" opens a chat thread with the AI. It will respond with the type of content you can "expect to see." Additionally, you can pile on more to really nail your ideal Discover feed. The post by 9to5 adds that you can even set the following content preferences: publishers, creators, formats, or "vibes."</p><h2 id="discover-more-2">Discover more</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:267px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.72%;"><img id="sSP3cwuaWXjr8fzGpCrgvU" name="google-app-search-labs-tailor-your-feed-description" alt="Google's "Tailor your feed" is a new Search Labs test that leans on the user's prompt to display content they want in the app's Discover feed." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sSP3cwuaWXjr8fzGpCrgvU.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="267" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:263px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:228.14%;"><img id="k9bX36LXYSKDqRTc5fh3vU" name="google-app-search-labs-tailor-your-feed-ai-chat" alt="Google's "Tailor your feed" test will let users enter their own prompt, alongside a few suggestions for how their should tailor their Discover feed." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/k9bX36LXYSKDqRTc5fh3vU.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="263" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>While Google is slowly kicking off this experiment for users in the U.S., there was another test for the Discover feed earlier this year.</p><p>Google experimented with turning users' Discover feeds into a short podcast this year with its "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wants-you-to-listen-to-your-discover-feed-with-daily-listen-experiment">Daily Listen</a>" test.

Audiophiles often dismiss earbuds from general tech brands, like Samsung, Google, or Apple, in favor of options from legacy audio brands, such as Sony or Bose. That said, I've been impressed by the latest Galaxy Buds, Pixel Buds, and AirPods models. Frankly, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">best earbuds for most users</a> are the ones that match their phone brand.</p><p>Of the bunch, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro</a> might be the most underrated. In terms of sound quality, the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro can hang with the best. They're comfortable, with solid active noise-canceling and an excellent software suite. Although there are a few places where the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro could be improved, I'm not excited for the upcoming Galaxy Buds 4 Pro.</p><p>Samsung's Galaxy Buds 4 Pro <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/leaked-galaxy-buds-4-icon-one-ui-8-5-another-new-look-for-samsung" target="_blank">first started leaking in October 2025</a>, and the leaks have continued at a rapid pace since then. Based on icons and graphics available in One UI 8.5 builds, we know that the Galaxy Buds 4 Pro will introduce a new design for the earbuds and case. However, it feels like Samsung is changing things for the sake of it. If that's the case, you should consider buying the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro now.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="b8495d00-1434-464a-9685-2294521fc17e" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro" data-dimension48="The Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro offer excellent sound and ANC, plus a striking design with LEDs on the stems.

It's not hard to figure out why. The Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro were ridiculed by fans and haters alike for their appearance, which channel the AirPods Pro style in a very similar way. This model added stems for the first time and snap-attaching ear tips for the first time, similar to AirPods.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-management-furious-latest-product-design">Samsung executives were reportedly furious</a> that the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro looked like a knockoff of the AirPods Pro. As a result, I'm not surprised at all that the company is set to make sweeping changes with the upcoming Galaxy Buds 4 Pro. I just didn't expect them to be this radical.</p><p>As <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-4-leak-shows-a-slight-design-reboot">revealed in a One UI 8.5 animations leak</a>, the Galaxy Buds 4 Pro are expected to have a revamped design with flatter stems, a different insertion angle, and a new mesh grill on the outside (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-4-look-3621013/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>). The triangular stems and their LED strips seem to be completely gone.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:960px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="p5TsuT5mdzSzPrjZdU4EwZ" name="galaxy-buds-4-pro-pics-2.jpg" alt="The Galaxy Buds 4 Pro design renders." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p5TsuT5mdzSzPrjZdU4EwZ.webp" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="960" height="720" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:960px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="qhWy98ugn8kCWyRZjKCGwZ" name="galaxy-buds-4-pro-pics-1.jpg" alt="The Galaxy Buds 4 Pro design renders." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qhWy98ugn8kCWyRZjKCGwZ.webp" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="960" height="720" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Looking at the leaked Galaxy Buds 4 Pro renders, I'm prematurely mourning the loss of the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro. I would've liked Samsung to improve the reliability of swipe gestures and pinch controls, which were too easy to accidentally trigger. I would've also welcomed sturdier ear tips and a refined connection system, as the current model's tips tend to tear when switched out often.</p><p>But a complete design overhaul? That feels excessive.</p><p>Considering the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro were arguably my favorite earbuds until Bose released the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-gen-2-earbuds-review">QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2</a> earbuds a few months ago, I'm worried the design changes could be for the worse. When it comes to headphone and earbud design, less is more. If it isn't broke, don't try to fix it.</p><p>It's a philosophy I'm all too familiar with, because Apple's revamped <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/airpods-pro-3-review">AirPods Pro 3</a> design left me on the outside looking in. Although I've used AirPods Pro and AirPods Pro 2 in the past, I simply don't find the newer model comfortable. That's the risk a company takes when it significantly changes the design of an audio product. What's frightening is that the rumored Galaxy Buds 4 Pro design changes look to be far greater than what Apple did with the AirPods Pro 3.</p><h2 id="samsung-might-revamp-the-galaxy-buds-4-pro-case-for-the-worse-2">Samsung might revamp the Galaxy Buds 4 Pro case for the worse </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vsR6tw6wU9v9iuTz5xXDCR" name="galaxy-buds3-pro-unboxing.jpg" alt="Galaxy Buds 3 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vsR6tw6wU9v9iuTz5xXDCR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung isn't stopping with just the earbuds — it's also rumored to be changing the case design as well. Instead of a tall charging case that the earbuds slide into vertically, the Galaxy Buds 4 Pro are expected to use a flat, jewelry-style charging case. I'm not a fan of this earbud case style, as they're typically larger and harder to pocket than the alternative. I feel like the Galaxy Buds 4 Pro replacement could be a step backward.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:975px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.10%;"><img id="aqFZBgCQqgSHXKd5awUWw8" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Buds-4-Pro-new-design" alt="new design and stem appearance of the Galaxy Buds 4 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aqFZBgCQqgSHXKd5awUWw8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="975" height="547" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The great thing I can say about the rumored Galaxy Buds 4 Pro is that they're still expected to lean into what Samsung's audio gear does best — software. In addition to classic features like game mode and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bluetooth-audio-terms-codecs-explained">Samsung Seamless Codec (SSC)</a> support, the Galaxy Buds 4 Pro are expected to add a "Find Your Phone" button on the charging case.</p><p>This button would <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/galaxy-buds-4-pro-case-might-add-a-crucial-button-the-last-model-was-missing">let you ping your phone via Bluetooth</a> from the earbuds' case. The reverse could work, too, with a speaker grille on the charging case. This is clearly the bright spot of a rumored charging case design change.</p><h2 id="the-galaxy-buds-3-pro-are-peak-samsung-earbuds-2">The Galaxy Buds 3 Pro are peak Samsung earbuds</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sqcAtMQne48WELxTzwmK4U" name="galaxy-buds3-pro-IN-CASE.jpg" alt="Galaxy Buds 3 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sqcAtMQne48WELxTzwmK4U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's far too early to say whether the Samsung Galaxy Buds 4 Pro will be a hit.

Then you simply select the device you want to stream to and playback will begin. As with other Chromecast playback, you'll be able to control everything directly from your phone.</p><p>The feature is already rolling out starting today. We were able to use it on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-series-your-ultimate-guide">Google Pixel 10 Pro</a> with the latest version of the Apple TV app (version 2.2.0). If you don't see the Cast icon yet, just update the app through the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apple.atve.androidtv.appletv">Google Play Store</a>.</p><h2 id="casting-from-apple-tv-app-on-android-is-now-possible-2">Casting from Apple TV app on Android is now possible</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="h4tP62ip3bgksnb6qm8Cr" name="apple-tv-google-cast-support" alt="Apple TV app with Chromecast support" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h4tP62ip3bgksnb6qm8Cr.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Apple notes that this feature will make it easier for users to stream "award-winning" shows and movies like <em>Severance</em>, <em>Slow Horses</em>, <em>The Morning Show</em>, <em>Pluribus</em>, and <em>F1 The Movie</em>.</p><p>It's also worth mentioning that Apple TV is slowly becoming a serious sports-streaming app with support for Major League Soccer, Friday Night Baseball, and Formula 1 races in the U.S. This expansion is great for users who don't own Apple devices but still want to stream content on the big screen.</p><p>The rollout comes at an interesting time.

It's only available in South Korea for now but global availability is expected to improve in 2026. The Z TriFold has similar dimensions as the Galaxy Z Fold 7 when folded, but it opens up to reveal a massive 10-inch display.</p><p>The third folding portion of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-hands-on">Galaxy Z TriFold</a> has allowed Samsung to increase the battery capacity to 5,600mAh. It also supports Super-Fast Charging 2.0 at 45W which is said to deliver up to a 50% charge in just 30 minutes. The phone also supports 15W wireless charging and Samsung's Wireless PowerShare feature for reverse wireless charging. This is the fastest wired charging foldable from Samsung yet, although <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-is-the-most-exciting-phone-around">Huawei's Mate XT</a> tri-fold phone charges at 66W.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TX8uHpF57iqEJFViw5CgEQ" name="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold hands-on testing at Dubai Mall on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TX8uHpF57iqEJFViw5CgEQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For a first attempt, we feel Samsung has done a splendid job and we can attest to this as our Senior Editor, Harish Jonnalagadda, went hands-on with it at Dubai Mall. The folding pattern is also different from Huawei's approach which has an accordion-style design while the Galaxy TriFold opens up like two flaps of a box. Samsung has armed the Galaxy Z TriFold with solid specs as it's powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC, 16GB of RAM, 512GB or 1TB of storage, and an IP48 rating.</p><p>The camera setup is similar to that of the Galaxy Z Fold 7 with a 200MP main sensor on the back. Noteably, the Galaxy Z TriFold only comes in one color called Crafted Black, with a Kevlar texture on the outside that looks pretty cool. When unfolded, the phone measures 3.9mm at its thinnest point. Because of the extra fold, the folded dimensions are much thicker than the z Fold 7 at 12.9mm. It's also a lot heavier at 309 grams.</p><p>Samsung is testing the waters with the Galaxy Z TriFold but it's already proving to be a huge hit. Despite the ~$2,430 price tag (when converted), the initial batch is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-galaxy-z-trifold-sold-out-like-hot-cakes-in-its-overseas-debut">reportedly sold out</a> in South Korea and it could prove to be a popular premium product in other markets too. It's no doubt one of the most unique <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> out there that many mobile productivity enthusiasts will be waiting to get their hands on in 2026.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="fc89202f-1d11-4574-b79e-5cc19e6e2ed0">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n492cdTmAtXoxYWXC3iyrB.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Still great for the rest of us</strong></em></p><p>While all eyes are on the Galaxy Z TriFold right now, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is still one of the best foldables in the market that's easily available and more affordable.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

Or at least sharing it with others. Conversely, it's nice to get an idea of what your friends are listening to and like. This can help you discover new music, maybe even learn that you have very similar music tastes.</p><p>A relatively new feature with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music">YouTube Music</a>, launched in celebration of the streamer's 10<sup>th</sup> birthday, is called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/10-years-of-fandom-youtube-music-adds-taste-match-playlists-concert-alerts">Taste Match</a>. It allows you to share a playlist with a friend, or even multiple friends, so they can contribute to it as well. The playlist automatically updates with content from everyone who joins so you'll get a surprise on your next run or commute home, hearing exciting new tunes just as your friends are. The collaborative playlist option is easy to set up in a few steps.</p><h2 id="how-to-taste-match-your-youtube-music-playlist-with-a-friend-2">How to taste match your YouTube Music playlist with a friend</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QPyoY7kvj88p7fNDDv6o4g" name="YouTube Music Taste Match" alt="YouTube Music Taste Match" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QPyoY7kvj88p7fNDDv6o4g.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Christine Persaud / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>1.

Any existing S Pens will not work on the folding phone's inner or outer displays. Samsung also dropped S Pen from the Galaxy Z Fold 7 in 2025.</p></article></section><h2 id="s-pen-support-is-all-but-extinct-on-samsung-foldables-2">S Pen support is all but extinct on Samsung foldables </h2><p>The Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold is official as of Dec. 1, 2025, and it's set to go on sale in South Korea on Dec. 12 at 10 a.m. local time. Some details are still up in the air, like U.S. pricing and availability. We know the Galaxy Z TriFold will come to the U.S. sometime in the first quarter of 2026, but we don't know how much it will cost or have an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-release-date">official release date</a>.</p><p>With that in mind, Samsung did release a complete specs sheet for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-trifold">Galaxy Z TriFold</a>, and it sets the record straight on S Pen compatibility. No, the Galaxy Z TriFold will not support any S Pen model, according to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/sec/smartphones/galaxy-z-trifold/specs/" target="_blank">official specs breakdown</a>. There's an "S Pen support" category on the Galaxy Z TriFold's product information page, and it clearly states S Pens are "not supported."</p><p>This isn't exactly surprising, but Galaxy fans may understandably be disappointed. The Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold has a 10-inch AMOLED inner screen that's larger than some tablets, and a first-party stylus would've been excellent for drawing and note-taking. However, styluses for folding phones are tricky to make. There's often no space for an internally-housed S Pen — like the Galaxy S25 Ultra uses — and their inner screens are still fragile enough that a pointy S Pen tip could cause damage.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4814px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ihqdSu9GTEx9FgovwdGvcT" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review-14" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ihqdSu9GTEx9FgovwdGvcT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4814" height="2708" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Like the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 pictured above, the Galaxy Z TriFold does not support the S Pen.  </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Additionally, Samsung removed S Pen support from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> earlier in 2025. This was another early signal that the company is moving away from styluses for foldable phones entirely, including the Galaxy Z TriFold. The move was made on the Galaxy Z Fold 7 to make the display assembly, and the phone itself, thinner. Since the Galaxy Z TriFold is thicker and folds twice, it's likely that adding a digitizer for S Pen support would've made the phone too thick.</p><p>The last Galaxy foldable to support an official S Pen was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, which worked with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-s-pen-pro-vs-s-pen-fold-edition">S Pen Fold Edition or S Pen Pro</a>. Newer models, including the Galaxy Z TriFold, have cut official stylus support entirely. You may be able to find third-party stylus options for the Galaxy Z TriFold, but these will lack the precision and integration of the official S Pen. You'll also have to make sure they won't damage the delicate Galaxy Z TriFold folding display.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold will make its way to the U.S. in early 2026, but unfortunately, it won't be coming with the S Pen in tow.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="005e2b38-ebef-4f28-b7ef-db33cb34646f">            <a href="https://www.samsung.com/sec/smartphones/galaxy-z-trifold/" data-model-name="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VJKygHEi5oBmEN8fNhEH6a.jpg' alt="Product box image of the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The latest and greatest</strong></em></p><p>Samsung's Galaxy Z TriFold features a 10-inch foldable AMOLED and a 6.5-inch cover screen, plus standalone DeX and usage as an external monitor for your PC.

The newer Watch 8 added a few improvements and upgrades, but the Watch 7 still holds up. It's especially competitive at this price point, being the lowest it's ever been and contrasting rivals with a lot of power and functionality.</p><p>This deal is for the 40mm version of the Watch 7, which includes a slightly smaller screen. For some, this is preferable to the 44mm for wearing while sleeping, and just being slightly less bulky overall.

It's exclusive to the four Pixel 10 models, namely the Google Pixel 10, Google Pixel 10 Pro, Google Pixel 10 Pro XL, and the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold.</p><p>Google describes power saving mode as offering a "simple, low-power map" on your lock screen. It keeps necessary navigation information, like your next turn, easily visible on the screen. However, it cuts out a lot of the unnecessary visual elements, switching to a black-and-white UI to save power. Google says this can "significantly" extend your phone's battery life.</p><p>There are a few limitations in addition to the feature being a Pixel 10 exclusive. It'll only work while driving, and you can only use power saving mode in portrait orientation.</p><h2 id="how-to-enable-and-use-google-maps-power-saving-mode-2">How to enable and use Google Maps power saving mode</h2><p>To use Google Maps power saving mode, you'll need to enable the feature in the app's settings menu once. After that, the low-power battery view will be one button away for future navigation sessions. Here's how to enable, use, and disable Google Maps power saving mode:</p><p>1. Open the <strong>Google Maps app</strong>.</p><p>2. Tap your <strong>Google Account picture</strong>.</p><p>3. Press <strong>Settings</strong> and <strong>Navigation</strong>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PogfB3jJ6RcRdoxrG88Vu8" name="Google-Maps-Power-Saving-Mode-1" alt="The screenshots for using Google Maps power saving mode." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PogfB3jJ6RcRdoxrG88Vu8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>4.

Now, you can turn off the unnecessary visual cues and features with one button thanks to Google Maps power saving mode. It's a toll every Google Pixel 10 owner should know about, as it might just help them get to their destination safely when their phone's battery is running on fumes.</p><p>Eventually, we're holding out hope Google Maps power saving mode might make its way to more Pixel models, and even other Android phones in the future.

The company originally planned to shake up the lineup by releasing a Galaxy S26 Pro instead of the base model and a Galaxy S26 Edge instead of the midsize option, according to early reports.

Instead of having separated rear camera lenses like the Galaxy S25 Plus, the Galaxy S26 Plus will have a pill-shaped camera island that the three cameras will sit atop of. This is the biggest design change for the Galaxy S26 Plus, and it's a relatively minor one.</p><p>Overall, the Galaxy S26 Plus will still sport a rectangular and boxy chassis with flat aluminum side rails. It's still a glass sandwich, with Corning's Gorilla Glass Victus 2 securing the front and back of the phone.

It's also an AMOLED panel with 120Hz variable refresh rates. Google does have the advantage of a brighter, 3,300-nit display. The Pixel 10 Pro XL also includes an accessibility setting for PWM-sensitive people, but this only doubles the standard PWM rate, and might not be suitable for everyone.</p><p>From a design standpoint, the Pixel 10 Pro XL is just as boxy as the upcoming Galaxy S26 Plus. However, it has a horizontal pill-shaped camera island near the top of the phone. The Pixel 10 Pro XL is expected to be much thicker and heavier than the Galaxy S26 Plus, with the Pixel camera bar protruding even further.</p><p>Google does offer IP68 protection and Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the front and back. Additionally, it crams Qi2 25W magnets inside the Pixel 10 Pro XL. While the Samsung Galaxy S26 Plus looks like it'll include Qi2 magnets, these might utilize the 15W standard.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-plus-vs-google-pixel-10-pro-xl-hardware-and-specs-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Plus vs. Google Pixel 10 Pro XL: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1420px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="dLqMe7oHakYTkaGYfTrzME" name="Galaxy-S26-Plus-CAD-renders" alt="CAD renders of the Samsung Galaxy S26 leak online" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dLqMe7oHakYTkaGYfTrzME.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1420" height="799" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Samsung Galaxy S26 Plus is expected to use the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chip, at least in some regions. Samsung might use a dual-chip strategy, shipping the phone with an Exynos processor in other markets. Surprisingly, it looks like Samsung will still opt to pair these chips with only 12GB of memory.</p><p>By comparison, the Pixel 10 Pro XL ships with a weaker Tensor G5 chip, but it's paired with a higher 16GB of RAM. Google Tensor chips already excel at AI processing, and the additional memory will only expand the use cases for the Pixel 10 Pro XL's on-device AI support. Additionally, the extra RAM could help the Pixel 10 Pro XL support future features that will be added throughout the phone's seven-year software support window.</p><div ><table><caption>Specifications</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy S26 Plus (Rumored / Expected)</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel 10 Pro XL</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>158.4 x 75.8 x 7.3 mm (6.24 x 2.98 x 0.29 in)</p></td><td  ><p>162.8mm x 76.6mm x 8.5mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Durability & Case Material(s)</p></td><td  ><p>IP68 rating for dust and water resistance, Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 (front and back), Aluminum frame</p></td><td  ><p>Gorilla Glass Victus 2 front-and back, IP68</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>190g</p></td><td  ><p>232g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.7-inch Dynamic AMOLED (1440x3120 pixels resolution), LTPO, 120Hz variable refresh rate</p></td><td  ><p>6.8-inch Super Actua OLED, 1344 x 2992, 486 PPI, 1-120Hz, 3,300 nits</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Chipset / SoC</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 (for Galaxy)</p></td><td  ><p>Google Tensor G5</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td><td  ><p>16GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB/512GB</p></td><td  ><p>256GB/512GB/1TB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Sensors</p></td><td  ><p>Under-display ultrasonic fingerprint sensor, Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Proximity sensor, Compass, and Barometer</p></td><td  ><p>Under-display ultrasonic fingerprint sensor, Ambient light sensor Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Proximity sensor, Magnetometer, and Barometer</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Wireless Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, 5G (mmWave and Sub-6), Bluetooth 5.4, GPS, NFC, UWB, and USB-C 3.2 (with DisplayPort)</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth v6, NFC, Dual-band GPS, 5G mmWave (NA only), 5G Sub-6, LTE</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Other Features</p></td><td  ><p>Samsung DeX (wired & wireless), Galaxy AI</p></td><td  ><p>Titan M2 chip, Ultrasonic fingerprint sensor, single-camera face unlock, Google VPN</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery & Charging</p></td><td  ><p>4,900mAh (Si/C), 45W (wired) and 15W (wireless) charging, Full Qi2 Support</p></td><td  ><p>5,200mAh, 45W wired, 25W Qi2.2 Pixelsnap wireless</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Cameras (Rear)</p></td><td  ><p>50MP wide-angle, 10MP telephoto (3x optical zoom), 12MP ultrawide, 8K video recording</p></td><td  ><p>50MP main, 48MP 123-degree ultrawide with macro focus, 48MP 5x telephoto, 4K/60 10-bit HDR on all cameras, 8K/30 on rear cameras</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Camera (Front)</p></td><td  ><p>12MP wide-angle | 4K video recording</p></td><td  ><p>42MP 103-degree Dual PD AF selfie | 4K video recording </p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS & Update Policy</p></td><td  ><p>Android 16 with One UI 8.5 (preinstalled), seven years of OS and security updates</p></td><td  ><p>Android 16 (preinstalled), seven years of OS and security updates</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The Google Pixel 10 Pro XL has a newer camera assortment, with a 50MP primary shooter, a 48MP ultrawide lens, and a 48MP telephoto with up to 5x optical zoom.

Based on rumors and leaks, the Galaxy S26 Plus will do just that. With a new chip, magnetic charging, and slight camera improvements, Samsung looks to be doing <em>just</em> enough to stay compatitive. However, it could be doing more, and the overall design and feel might come off as stale to longtime Galaxy fans.</p><p>Google is heading in a different direction. Compare the Galaxy S26 Plus to the Galaxy S23 Plus, and you won't find major differences. Do the same for the Pixel 10 Pro XL and the Pixel 7 Pro and it's wildly different. Google exudes polish with its recent flagships, even if they're a bit thicker and heavier than I'd like. We can't fault anyone for going with the Pixel 10 Pro XL today as a result, but there's also a case for waiting for the cheaper Galaxy S26 Plus.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="d36bc90e-c841-4def-80c9-f2fced7d482c">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pzkcj8YMqwNYbgHkLXibwc.jpg' alt="The rumored product render of the Samsung Galaxy S26 Pro."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy S26 Plus</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Worth waiting for</strong></em></p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S26 Plus might not offer a full revamp for Galaxy users, but there are still upgrades worth waiting for.

The latest Gemini 2.5 Flash Native Audio is rolling out now for developers in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI, and for Gemini Live and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-search-goes-live-with-this-new-feature-that-we-didnt-know-we-needed">Search Live</a> users.</p><p>The changes will make it easier to converse with Gemini while chatting live, and can improve the quality of Google's Live Voice Agents. Specifically, new Gemini 2.5 Flash Native Audio 12-25 model improves multi-turn conversation quality. When you chat with Gemini Live across multiple turns, it'll remember context from old turns. The extra context helps create "more cohesive conversations," <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-audio-model-updates/" target="_blank">according to Google</a>.</p><p>The model is also better at interacting with external workflows without impacting the smoothness of your conversation. It can pick up on your audial cues to figure out when to access these outside functions. These external workflows can provide real-time information that Gemini 2.5 Flash Native Audio can subsequently insert into its audio responses.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5eA5aZpVYbs" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Gemini's Live Voice Agent is also better at understanding and acting upon complex instructions from a user. Google says these upgrades result in "higher user satisfaction on content completeness." In other words, when interacting with a Live Voice Agent powered by Gemini 2.5 Flash Native Audio 12-25, you may not need to demand to speak to a human representative. The artificial intelligence model might be able to handle more multi-step tasks on its own.</p><p>It's more reliable overall, with a 90% adherence rate to developer instructions. That's an increase of six percent compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-gemini-2-5-models-deep-think-flash-updates">older Gemini 2.5 Flash Native Audio</a> 9-25 model.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XPg5Upx4kBvR5qovS6VixQ" name="gemini-audio_blog_light_blue_16x9_v1_25-12-12" alt="The improvements made to Gemini 2.5 Flash native audio." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XPg5Upx4kBvR5qovS6VixQ.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In the ComplexFuncBench Audio benchmark, the latest Gemini 2.5 Flash Native Audio model beats both its predecessor and OpenAI's gpt-realtime model with a score of 71.5%.</p><p>The upgraded Gemini 2.5 Flash Native Audio, as well as Live Voice Agents, are available now in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI.

While Meta's Ray-Ban Display glasses aren't a prototype, they are positioned for early adopters, and we expect the company to continue expanding their capabilities over time. Ahead of 2026, Meta's CTO Andrew Bosworth is previewing what's next for Ray-Ban Display glasses, and the future looks bright.</p><p>The core <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-put-the-future-of-tech-on-your-face">Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses</a> experience is powered by the Meta Neural Band. It's an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-leaked-smartwatch-with-brain-signal-tech-would-be-perfect-match">included wristband with EMG technology</a> that can map thousands of motor neurons and associate them with gestures. At launch, Ray-Ban Display supported the Neural Band for things like clicks, scrolls, and dials. However, that's just the start, as Bosworth <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/blog/boz-2025-look-back-2026-look-ahead/" target="_blank">confirms</a> the EMG band "can become capable of recognizing increasingly complex inputs as time goes on."</p><p>Meta says that EMG handwriting is coming "soon" for Ray-Ban Display and Neural Band users.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="g3Vh8vkJTAXzRQq28ATTAn" name="Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-glasses-sEMG-band" alt="A selfie of the author wearing Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, holding his wrist with the Meta sEMG band close to the camera." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/g3Vh8vkJTAXzRQq28ATTAn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>"Soon we’ll roll out EMG handwriting — dozens of new neural signals that allow the band to reliably recognize every letter of the alphabet," Bosworth explains. "The more data we gather, the more capable it becomes."</p><div><blockquote><p>This is a foundational shift in how humans will interact with computers.</p><p>Andrew Bosworth, Meta CTO</p></blockquote></div><p>Early access for EMG handwriting is set to arrive next month, with wider availability to follow. The feature could make it possible for Ray-Ban Display users to type and communicate with their smart glasses by simply drawing or gesturing on a flat surface while wearing the Meta Neural Band.</p><p>That's not all Meta has in store for Ray-Ban Display users, though. Owners are clamoring for a way to watch videos on the monocular display glasses, and in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.threads.com/@boztank/post/DSIq5gCFi64?xmt=AQF0rFyurSfEVTx-DO4J4vTwOICh2B1mUmrA3szVsde-Zw" target="_blank">a series of Threads comments</a>, Bosworth confirmed something is in the works. Support for Instagram Reels undergoes internal testing at Meta this month. Then, it'll roll out "in a couple of months."</p><p>Meta's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-hands-on-demo-impressions">Ray-Ban Display glasses cost $799</a>, and while that includes a custom-fitted Neural Band, it's an expensive early-adopter product. The monocular display (meaning there's only a screen in one lens) and limited prescription support further narrows down the glasses' niche. With that being said, it's looking like 2026 will bring exciting new features to the smart glasses.</p> ]]></dc:content>

If a photo had multiple objects or details, you had to rely on carefully worded prompts and hope Gemini focused on the right thing.</p><p>That approach worked sometimes, but it often felt like talking past the AI. The new markup tools aim to fill that gap by letting you guide Gemini visually rather than verbally (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/gemini-markup-tools-3625092/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>).</p><p>Once the feature is live for you, attaching an image in Gemini displays a brief note about a markup interface. From there, you can sketch directly onto the image or add text annotations. For example, you can circle an object, draw an arrow, highlight a section, or write a note. Gemini will use these markings as context when handling your request.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:410px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:214.63%;"><img id="dgXNfsBKsFinAzdwkrgA6W" name="Gemini-markup-tools" alt="new markup tools inside Gemini" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dgXNfsBKsFinAzdwkrgA6W.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="410" height="880" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:410px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:214.63%;"><img id="sZXUYkCjtzBNHw8Ts4Lr7W" name="Gemini-markup-tools" alt="new markup tools inside Gemini" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sZXUYkCjtzBNHw8Ts4Lr7W.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="410" height="880" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:410px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:214.63%;"><img id="iZwV8Q65d2H25ragCHJY4W" name="Gemini-markup-tools" alt="new markup tools inside Gemini" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iZwV8Q65d2H25ragCHJY4W.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="410" height="880" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:410px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:214.63%;"><img id="39Rhy48UKaD5VrhX8WGy7W" name="Gemini-markup-tools" alt="new markup tools inside Gemini" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/39Rhy48UKaD5VrhX8WGy7W.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="410" height="880" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Real-world usage is still a mixed bag.

If you want to know what something is, you can highlight the exact item instead of describing it. If you are editing a photo, you can mark the area you want changed instead of writing a long explanation.</p><p>Google has been preparing for this type of interaction for months. Earlier leaks showed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-tipped-to-bring-an-annotation-feature-to-geminis-images">image-highlighting tools meant to help Gemini focus better</a>. The company has also been improving image editing, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-nano-banana-ai-image-tool-is-taking-over-your-favorite-apps">models that support natural-language edits and keep subjects consistent</a>. The markup feature brings these abilities together in a way that feels more natural for users.</p><p>Right now, availability seems to be limited, and Google hasn't formally announced it yet. This appears to be a server-side rollout, so even users with the latest Gemini app may not see it yet. Still, the fact that some users can try it shows Google is ready to expand it soon.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Make sure to <a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=androidcentral.com" target="_blank"><strong>set Android Central as a preferred source</strong></a> in Google Search, and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should"><strong>find out why you should</strong></a> so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>First available <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-ai-mode-search-live-test-android-ios-underway">as a Google Labs experiment</a>, Search Live became a core part of the AI Mode experience when it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-search-goes-live-with-this-new-feature-that-we-didnt-know-we-needed">debuted in the U.S. in September 2025</a>. It made it possible to have a back-and-forth conversation with AI while using Google Search. If you're familiar with Gemini Live, Search Live is similar, but its goal is to connect you with links and sites on the web. Now, it's becoming conversational thanks to a native audio model update.</p><p>The refresh brings responses that are "more fluid and expressive" to Search Live users. Powered by the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-gemini-2-5-flash-native-audio-model">Gemini 2.5 Flash Native Audio 12-25 model</a>, the Search Live is more dynamic, adjusting its voice speed, tone, and style based on your preferences. Google announced the upgrade in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/search/live-audio-gemini-model-update/" target="_blank">blog post</a>, saying that Search Live users can now "enjoy smoother, more natural conversations."</p><p>Search Live's enhanced conversational understanding lets you customize how your AI's voice sounds on the fly. In the example <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kKyxgKSz3A" target="_blank">YouTube video</a> below, Google shows off Search Live answering a question about a rock, leveraging the live video feed and internet sources.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9kKyxgKSz3A" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>In this example, Search Live responds with a fast-talking, bright, and enthusiastic voice. Then, the user asks Search Live to talk slower so their child can understand, and the voice immediately becomes deeper and more authoritative. It also speaks in a slower pace with more emphasis on enunciation in the delivery, so a young child can understand.</p><p>These changes happen in real time with no delay. They're specific to your current Search Live conversation, so you can ask for a custom speaking style every time you go live with AI Mode.</p><p>The upgrades come from the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/gemini">Gemini</a> native audio model, which is also rolling out in Gemini Live, and is available for developers in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI.</p><h2 id="when-you-can-try-search-live-s-smoother-conversations-2">When you can try Search Live's smoother conversations</h2><p>Search Live's upgraded conversations are rolling out for all U.S. users. The rollout began Dec. 12 and will continue over the course of this week. You can find it in the Google app for iOS and Android.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The feature, known as Motion Cues, was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-could-steal-a-crucial-ios-18-feature-that-helps-curb-motion-sickness">discovered way back in 2024</a>. While the tool appears to be fully functional in Google Play Service, we're still waiting for a public release. Now, a report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-17-motion-cues-rumor-3624642/" target="_blank">Android Authority's Mishaal Rahman</a> reveals that Motion Could debut within <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-17">Android 17</a> — and the reason why it's taking so long.</p><p>Like Apple's Vehicle Motion Cues, Google's version overlays motion dots to give the user signals as to which direction the vehicle is moving. This could allow people suffering from motion sickness to use their Android phone while riding in car. However, as currently built, Motion Cues can only display over other apps — not system elements.</p><p>As Android Authority discovered, Android's motion dots do not appear over the Settings app, status bar, notifications, Quick Settings, lock screen, or volume panel. The report explains that Android's default overlay API prevents the feature from working in these areas as a safety feature. The security restriction hampers Motion Cues' ability to create an immersive overlay of your vehicle's movement, as it can be interrupted by various system elements.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eZdFD8fNtjyu7rJ2fZkKd9" name="Motion-Cues-Android-Authority" alt="The Motion Assist feature in Android 17." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eZdFD8fNtjyu7rJ2fZkKd9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google's solution to this problem could be to introduce a new Motion Cues API, per the report. There are signs in Android Canary's 2512 build that an upcoming Motion Cues API could use SystemUI for the rendering of motion dots. As the SystemUI app is responsible for handling system elements, the new API and integrations could solve the problems with Motion Cues in its current, unreleased form.</p><p>In a future update, Motion Cues could leverage both Google Play Services and SystemUI. The former might handle the location and appearance of Motion Cues, and SystemUI could be tasked with displaying them.</p><p>However, a new system API cannot be added with a Google Play Services update or a server-side push. Instead, new APIs are added through full operating system updates, like a quarterly Android release or a complete version update. As such, the earliest Motion Cues is likely to debut is alongside Android 16 QPR3, but Android 17 is starting to look most likely.</p><p>Motion Cues would be Android's answer to Apple's Vehicle Motion Cues. To differentiate the feature, Google could brand the finished product as Motion Assist. This name would fit nicely with other Google features, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pixel-call-assist">Pixel's Call Assist</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Make sure to <a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=androidcentral.com" target="_blank"><strong>set Android Central as a preferred source</strong></a> in Google Search, and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should"><strong>find out why you should</strong></a> so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>For messaging, most Google users turn to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-first-things-to-do">Google Messages</a>. The company also has a specialized messaging client for Workspace teams called Google Chat, though. Starting this week, Google is making two key changes to Chat that'll make the platform quicker and add a long-overdue messaging feature. These changes arrive as part of an extended rollout, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/12/a-new-web-address-for-google-chat.html" target="_blank">according to Google</a>, meaning they might take a few weeks to show up for everyone.</p><p>You might not know that the old web URL for Google Chat doesn't follow the typical Google format. Google Chat was originally found on the web at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://mail.google.com/chat" target="_blank">mail.google.com/chat</a>, and it's now moving to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://chat.google.com/" target="_blank">chat.google.com</a>. The small tweak might break some Google Chat extensions, so be sure to update your extensions to be compatible with the new URL.</p><p>Aside from the URL change giving Google Chat an online home separate from Gmail, the shift brings a big improvement for users. Google says the fresh URL reduces loading time, allowing Google Chat's web client to run faster. Crucially, it doesn't affect the Chat user interface, and bookmarks and links to the old URL will still work.</p><p>Separately, Google is adding a schedule send feature to Chat that works similarly to scheduling an email in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gmail">Gmail</a>. When creating a message in a Chat conversation, you can click the menu beside the send button to open the schedule. From there, you can pick a suggested schedule send time or choose a custom time.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:62.50%;"><img id="iDjJwVQYWMVXQMhSSEYW8T" name="Clicking on the down arrow next to the Sent button brings up the Schedule send menu" alt="The schedule send feature in Google Chat." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iDjJwVQYWMVXQMhSSEYW8T.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-chat">Google Chat</a> will now display a banner above the compose box when you have a scheduled message in a particular conversations. After they've been scheduled, you can manage scheduled messages by opening the new <strong>Drafts</strong> shortcut in the Chat sidebar. This new area will let Chat users edit, reschedule, or cancel messages.</p><p>Notably, you'll only see a Drafts page in the sidebar when you have active scheduled messages.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:62.50%;"><img id="BDvXwdQZSXUjXcMQUBPZ8T" name="New Drafts shortcut to edit, reschedule, send, and delete your scheduled messages" alt="The schedule send feature in Google Chat." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BDvXwdQZSXUjXcMQUBPZ8T.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Both the new Google Chat URL and schedule send support are rolling out now for Workspace users on rapid release domains.

It, however, appears Samsung is hiding even more Galaxy AI features within the build.</p><h2 id="ai-notification-summaries-may-remain-exclusive-to-galaxy-s26-at-first-2">AI notification summaries may remain exclusive to Galaxy S26 at first</h2><p>According to reliable leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/chunvn8888/status/1999404746608939214">@chunvn8888 on X</a>, "lots" of One UI 8.5 features are not available right now because Samsung is keeping them exclusive to the Galaxy S26 series at launch.</p><p>One of the features the leaker mentions is the AI notification summary feature. This tool is reportedly part of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-testing-smarter-notifications-one-ui-8-5-beta">One UI 8.5</a> but currently disabled. It will use Samsung's in-house Gauss model to provide users with a summary of their notifications from the past 24 hours.</p><p>The leaker adds that the feature will support several languages at launch including English, Korean, Spanish, German, French, Portuguese, Polish, simplified Chinese (中国大陆), Japanese, Hindi, Vietnamese, and Thai.</p><p>The feature will likely remain exclusive to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-accidentally-leaks-s26-design-one-ui-8-5">Galaxy S26 series</a> at first, with Samsung eventually rolling it out to other Galaxy phones, including the Galaxy S25 series, Galaxy Z Fold 7, Galaxy Z Flip 7, and more later.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sTrPFUQTZp4La3Zcff3vnS" name="Google Pixel AI Summaries" alt="Google Pixel AI Summaries" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sTrPFUQTZp4La3Zcff3vnS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Christine Persaud)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If this feature sounds familiar, that's because it is.

This week, the entertainment giant sent a cease-and-desist letter to Google, claiming that Google’s AI tools have used Disney’s copyrighted material on a "massive scale" to train their models, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/disney-google-ai-copyright-infringement-cease-and-desist-letter-1236606429/" target="_blank">Variety</a> reports.</p><p>Disney claims that Google’s AI models have been trained on and are producing unauthorized images and videos featuring popular Disney characters such as those from Frozen, The Lion King, Moana, The Little Mermaid, Deadpool, Guardians of the Galaxy, Star Wars, and others.</p><p>The company’s legal team also said that some of these AI-generated outputs include Google’s logo, which could make people think the content is officially approved by Disney.</p><p>Disney explained that it has raised these concerns with Google for months, but, as discussions did not resolve the issue, it decided to issue a formal legal warning to stop the alleged misuse of its intellectual property.</p><h2 id="google-begins-the-cleanup-2">Google begins the cleanup</h2><p>After receiving the notice, Google began working with Disney to take down dozens of AI-generated videos that featured popular characters, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://deadline.com/2025/12/google-takes-down-disney-ai-videos-cease-desist-1236647823/" target="_blank">Deadline</a> reports.</p><p>The search giant maintains that it uses "public data from the open web" to train its models. A Google spokesperson emphasized their "longstanding and mutually beneficial relationship with Disney," pointing to tools they’ve built, such as Content ID, that help rights holders manage their work.</p><p>AI systems are usually trained on large amounts of data collected from the public web, which can include copyrighted material. This practice often goes unnoticed until well-known characters, such as Mickey Mouse or Elsa, appear in AI-generated content without permission.</p><p>However, Disney is not turning away from AI altogether.

This is the first time Android has offered this, and some beta testers are already using it.</p><p>Until now, Android users had to use "Starred Contacts" or repeat caller settings to filter unwanted calls, but those were always blunt instruments. Google is changing this with a new feature called Expressive Calling, now available in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-phone-apps-simpler-layout-is-now-hitting-more-devices">Google Phone app</a> beta (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/12/13/google-phone-expressive-calling-beta/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>With this update, your contacts can tell you the reason for their call before you answer, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-phone-app-may-soon-make-your-urgent-calls-hard-to-ignore">feature that was spotted in November</a> before Google made it official earlier this month.</p><p>The idea is straightforward but overdue. When you make a call, the app can ask if it’s urgent. If you choose urgent, the person you’re calling will see an “It’s urgent!” message along with an animated siren emoji. If they miss the call, the urgent label stays in the call log, so it’s clear this was not just a regular call.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:390px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:223.08%;"><img id="jhjtDbLCGQEQDQyF6iTmpk" name="Google-Phone-expressive-calling" alt="expressive calling settings page in the Google Phone app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jhjtDbLCGQEQDQyF6iTmpk.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="390" height="870" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:390px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:223.08%;"><img id="ngmBJhY8qc7DzAditSHMpk" name="Google-Phone-expressive-calling" alt="expressive calling settings page in the Google Phone app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ngmBJhY8qc7DzAditSHMpk.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="390" height="870" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>This ties into a broader feature Google has been testing called Call Reason. Instead of calls being anonymous interruptions, Android can now add context to them. This is especially helpful when Do Not Disturb is on. Depending on the recipient’s settings, an urgent call can either break through Do Not Disturb or appear quietly, still marked as important.</p><h2 id="contacts-only-safety-net-2">Contacts-only safety net</h2><p>The main change is that you now have more choice. You’re no longer forced to whitelist people permanently just in case something goes wrong one day.</p><p>However, Expressive Calling is not available to everyone yet. For now, it only works if both the caller and the recipient are using the Phone app beta. This limits who can use it, but it also shows that Google is still testing the feature before releasing it widely.</p><p>Of course, there is a risk that people might misuse the urgent label. If every call is marked urgent, it will lose its meaning. Google seems to know about this risk, which is probably why the feature is being released slowly and with controls for users.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It's thin, fast, has a solid camera system, and has an even larger screen when unfolded.</p><p>When it was announced, my excitement obviously boiled over, as is usually the case when new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> are announced. Since then, my excitement has slowly been diminishing to the point that I don't know if I'll actually try and buy one at launch. (Who am I kidding, of course I am.)</p><p>Even if I do fork over one of my kidneys to pay the likely even more exorbitant price tag, I'm kind of unsure how long it'll remain my daily carry. And frankly, I have Harish to blame for this, as he recently got some hands-on time with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-hands-on">Galaxy Z TriFold</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure pull-left inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:661px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:29.95%;"><img id="shw6vroRiUxqcvWLRPZjB6" name="click-to-follow-ac-lloyd-sq-g" alt="Click to Follow Android Central on Google" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/shw6vroRiUxqcvWLRPZjB6.jpg" mos="" align="left" fullscreen="" width="661" height="198" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-left"></p></div></div></figure><p>Enjoy our content?

Instead of just two screen sizes to choose from, the Mate XT lets you keep one screen closed, giving you a total of three screen configurations.</p><p>This adds another layer of versatility, as there will likely be times when I don't want to use a 10-inch tablet but would be okay with using an 8-inch one. Unfortunately, this doesn't seem to be the way Samsung decided to go, and I'm really curious as to why.</p><h2 id="dex-mode-should-ve-been-the-default-2">DeX Mode should've been the default</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="hv8NUhNFFZwdogshxor4cR" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review-9" alt="Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra using Samsung DeX with multiple windows open" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hv8NUhNFFZwdogshxor4cR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Something else that left me a bit confused is that if Samsung is only going to give us two configuration options, why isn't <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-should-make-dex-tablet-default">DeX Mode the default layout</a> when unfolding the phone? It's the same question I've been asking for years whenever a new Galaxy Tab is released, as Android just isn't well-suited for larger displays without a boatload of tinkering.</p><p>And it's not like you can just seamlessly install a different <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-launchers" target="_blank">launcher</a>, because of API limitations, resulting in a very broken experience. Technically, it is possible, but installing and using different launchers requires a bit of tinkering with Bixby Routines or something like Tasker.

But it's for the same reason that I harp on Samsung and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-review">Google</a> for not including flagship cameras in their most expensive phones.</p><p>Don't get me wrong, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-vs-regular-snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a> is an extremely performant processor, and will definitely last for as long as those trifold screens do.

And while that may not appeal to consumers who are a bit wary of AI, the new app redesign brings the Fitbit app into the modern Android era while making it feel more like a comprehensive fitness guide than the standard version.</p><p>At the moment, there still isn’t feature parity with the standard Fitbit app. But what’s new is rather interesting and makes me excited for the full version of the new app, which is expected to roll out sometime in 2.</p><p>For now, this is what it’s been like to use Fitbit’s new personal health coach preview.</p><h2 id="meet-me-in-the-middle-2">Meet me in the middle</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="FDtMpLjuspdaCtXqmoJSW8" name="Fitbit-Personal-Health-Coach-preview-12" alt="Fitbit personal health coach Today tab focus metrics" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FDtMpLjuspdaCtXqmoJSW8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>After switching to the new preview for the first time, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-get-started-fitbit-personal-ai-health-coach">setting up the new health coach preview</a> was a bit more involved than I expected. After a quick introduction and tapping through some notices regarding data use, I was invited to have a chat with the AI health coach. Where the previous app simply had you input your goals, such as daily steps and sleep, the health coach turns the process into a conversation.</p><p>During this process, I talked to it about what I hoped to achieve and what I think works or doesn’t work for me. The coach was about as responsive as I expected from a Gemini-powered AI, and it seemed to be making a genuine effort to get to know me and understand my goals. I told it that I was looking to gain muscle and lose body fat while also hoping to build enough endurance to run my first 5K.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="vrdy4722iqbYRSdWvBxUQ8" name="Fitbit-Personal-Health-Coach-preview-01" alt="Fitbit personal health coach setup" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vrdy4722iqbYRSdWvBxUQ8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I was then directed to have a separate chat to set up a workout plan, though this is optional. The AI drew on what it knew about me from our previous conversation and came up with a plan to help me achieve it, while keeping certain details in mind, such as my asthma (it suggested lighter runs as a result).</p><p>I didn’t like the first suggestion it gave me, since I wanted to incorporate some of what I already do, such as a daily morning run and instructor-led yoga, Pilates, and HIIT on Sundays, Mondays, and Tuesdays, respectively.

When I select a session, there's no option to start a workout from the app. Instead, I have to go into my watch and start my own workout manually. From there, I have to manually mark in the app that I've finished each set/session, enter my reps, and input my total weight.</p><p>This differs from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin</a>, where I can set up a plan, access it on the watch, and follow each exercise from my wrist, which can also save my reps and weight without me needing to touch my phone.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="jtrywuHChhDv3AoNiJSME8" name="Fitbit-Personal-Health-Coach-preview-07" alt="Fitbit personal health coach "Mark workout as done" button" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jtrywuHChhDv3AoNiJSME8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's just too much manual input, including having to link my tracked workout to the scheduled one.

On Garmin, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-venu-4-fitness-heart-rate-steps">reps are automatically counted</a>, sets automatically start and stop, and the watch can fairly accurately determine which exercises you're doing just by how you're moving.

Some, like Garmin smartwatches, are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-best-smartwatch-if-youre-wheelchair-bound">better than others</a>, but they still don't compare to using one for people without mobility issues.</p><p>Unfortunately, I don't see this changing any time soon, if ever.</p><h2 id="we-re-built-different-2">We're built different</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ReQt7HNf2JKsWow7hoJ4fN" name="Fitbit-Premium-Health-Coach-Today-tab" alt="A photo of the Google Pixel Watch 4 sitting next to a Pixel 9a open to the Fitbit app, showing the Fitbit Premium Health Coach preview with the Today tab open; it shows new widgets and insights." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ReQt7HNf2JKsWow7hoJ4fN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The difficulty in creating accurate and useful fitness trackers for wheelchair users stems from a combination of technological limitations, fundamental differences in movement, and a historical lack of dedicated research and market focus.</p><p>The core technology in most commercial wearables is designed for the "able-bodied" population, which creates fundamental inaccuracies when applied to wheelchair use. I'm talking smartwatches here, because something as small as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">smart ring</a> or s<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/lumia-2-launches-as-the-first-customizable-smart-earrings-that-track-your-overall-health">mart earrings</a> simply doesn't have the space to fit anything more inside.</p><p>Wearable trackers primarily use an accelerometer to count steps by detecting specific motions involved in walking or running. That data is what's used to calculate other features, like calorie counting or a sort of body battery measurement.</p><p>When you use a manual wheelchair, the arm and torso movements are different from they are when walking or running. This usually leads to either an overestimation or an underestimation of "steps" and calories burned. A simple accelerometer is not designed to measure these.</p><h2 id="different-tech-is-needed-2">Different tech is needed</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="KnRXHNGqaUaah6kE3S3xMR" name="Garmin-Venu-4-review-29" alt="Garmin Venu 4 Elevate sensor" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KnRXHNGqaUaah6kE3S3xMR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The software algorithms that determine energy expenditure use a combination of data such as heart rate, height, and weight, and accelerometer readings. To make matters worse, all this is designed with lower-body movement in mind.</p><p>To push a wheelchair, you rely on your upper body. Usually, this is less demanding than "normal" leg-based movements. This means that even if a wearable <em>underestimates</em> your number of pushes, the result can still be <em>overestimated</em> because your body isn't working as hard to move forward.</p><p>It's difficult to reasonably assess any sort of fitness goal when things are both over- and underestimated all at the same time. Garmin, to its credit, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/garmin-technology/health-science/wheelchair-physiology/?cjdata=MXxOfDB8WXww&zebratwo=CJ&cjevent=809df364d6cb11f08069033d0a82b820&utm_source=CJ&utm_medium=Text" target="_blank">does explain how it tries to compensate</a> for this and use a different software algorithm when you use Wheelchair Mode on one of the company's watches.</p><p>Apple, Samsung, and Google are all working on making it better, too, even if they aren't quite there yet. Even with my Garmin, the readings and calculations aren't very accurate because of differences in movement and the limitations of "normal" sensors in gauging it.</p><p>Modern medicine isn't likely to change how people in wheelchairs use their bodies to move, but technology could be built that caters to it. The University of Pittsburgh’s Human Engineering Research Lab is working on how to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3058074/these-scientists-are-building-fitness-trackers-that-work-for-people-with-disabilities">build a fitness tracking system for people with ambulatory issues, </a>but it would probably lead to an entirely new product category of devices. Their research involves wearable tech on the wrist and face (to monitor breathing and oxygen intake) as well as tech on the wheelchair itself. Think of a smart chair, like we've seen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-partners-adidas-launch-new-smart-insole-can-track-your-soccer-skills">Google explore smart shoe insoles</a>.</p><h2 id="the-market-isn-t-there-2">The market isn't there</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZyoCdfDsYxkEMwu5CmwMSK" name="Garmin_Venu3_push-counting-1.jpg" alt="Garmin Venu 3 push tracker" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZyoCdfDsYxkEMwu5CmwMSK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Maybe a bigger issue is the market itself and historical research into the problem. I'm not complaining that people without any issues walking around don't think about wheelchair users, and I never want to sound demanding. The fact is that not as much research goes into wheelchair fitness tracking. This can change and probably will, but it's unlikely to catch up.</p><p>The market simply isn't there to justify the enormous costs. There are more people with ambulatory issues than you probably realize, but the number is still dwarfed by those without any. And, to be frank, many people in a wheelchair just don't care about their fitness. For every wheel-basketball player (those guys are amazing and my heroes), there will be dozens (or more) users who aren't interested in seeing how active they can be. To be fair, it is tough to give a damn when you live in a world that wasn't designed to accommodate you.</p><p>In any case, the number of people who would buy a costly fitness-tracking system will never be high. Any company willing to do the research isn't going to profit from it, and companies that actually build the devices would probably lose money. For now, it's in the hands of forward-looking thinktanks like the University of Pittsburgh.</p><h2 id="for-now-i-ll-stick-with-my-garmin-2">For now, I'll stick with my Garmin</h2><p>I'm not bitter. I've learned how to use the information my Garmin watch gives me, and even though I can't trust it at face value, it is mostly consistent. It's useful to help in some ways; I lift weights to keep my upper body strong, and it can help me there.</p><p>If things ever change, I would try to buy into a better way, though I'm in the minority. I'm just happy that big tech hasn't forgotten about me, even if they're taking a long time to produce mediocre results.</p> ]]></dc:content>

With features like "PC Connect" and "Likeness," Google is reimagining creativity, giving users more room to be productive with the multi-view screen and a digital avatar of you that mirrors your facial expressions and hand gestures in real-time, during team meetings.</p><p>As for Project Aura, which is supposedly equipped with a 70-degree field of view and optical see-through technology, these glasses are said to overlay the digital content within your field of view, turning it into a massive screen for work or entertainment.</p><h2 id="one-ui-8-5-is-here-sorta-2">One UI 8.5 is here...

While it might sound like a small software tweak, One UI 8.5 brings new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI features</a> to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/which-samsung-galaxy-s25-model-should-you-buy">Galaxy S25 series</a> for now.</p><p>This includes an updated Photo Assist that helps you continue without saving each iteration on your device. This means you can use AI Eraser, then move or restyle the image in Photo Assist without saving it first.</p><p>With this new beta update, Samsung also adds new Theft Protection tools, a redesigned UI with 3D icons, and a customizable Quick Settings panel. Storage Share lets users access files across Galaxy phones, tablets, PCs, and even Samsung TVs. Many apps, including Calculator, Clock, and Samsung Health, have been redesigned for better visuals.</p><p>The One UI 8.5 beta is only available on Galaxy S25 series smartphones.

Android Central's Nicholas Sutrich and Derrek Lee got a package from Motorola earlier this week, and the box had an invite to its CES display, plus a wooden flip book that opens and folds into a lamp, with a dim red light.</p><p>According to Sutrich, the lamp features a magnetic clasp that keeps it fully open and folded backward. The most obvious indication is within the invite itself, which states, "We're getting ready to unfold a new perspective at Lenovo Tech World, set to take place on January 6." The emphasis on "unfold" caught our attention, given that Motorola's current foldable phones are all Flip devices.</p><p>The mysterious device might also feature a wooden finish, as suggested by the wooden cover of the foldable lamp. It also has the Motorola "M" logo engraved on it, with the line "every fold reveals a possibility."</p><h2 id="december-pixel-update-got-bugg-y-for-some-2">December Pixel update got bugg-y for some</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="uPmu5rhFzr7dnamiB939CQ" name="google-pixel-10-wireless-qi2-charging-puck-02" alt="The official Google Pixelsnap Qi2 wireless charger and dock for the Google Pixel 10 series" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uPmu5rhFzr7dnamiB939CQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsungs-next-galaxy-watch-ultra-wont-land-in-2025-heres-why-the-2026-reboot-matters"><strong>here</strong></a></p><p>Google recently rolled out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/december-drop-google-brings-fresh-updates-for-android-users">Android 16 QPR2 update</a> for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review">Pixel 10</a> series.

Following the update, many Pixel 10 series users report that the Pixel Stand (2nd Gen) no longer works, even though it previously worked at the "perfect angle." As reported on Reddit, placing a Pixel 10 on the Stand now causes it to flash orange and white and reportedly throw a charging error, suggesting Google intentionally broke support.</p><p>This only seems to suggest that Google wants to push its new Qi2 chargers to Pixel 10 owners, officially ending support for others on the market.</p><h2 id="qualcomm-brings-two-mid-range-chips-to-the-areana-2">Qualcomm brings two mid-range chips to the areana</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:814px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.14%;"><img id="kbidJCdCpXnihJvWUTTP3C" name="qualcomm-extends-support-for-updates-on-android-devices-snapdragon-8-elite" alt="Qualcomm 8 years support for phones" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kbidJCdCpXnihJvWUTTP3C.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="814" height="457" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/one-ui-8-5-update-changelog-leaked"><strong>here</strong></a></p><p>Qualcomm announced two chips today (Dec 11) for the mid-range and entry-level markets: the Snapdragon 6s 4G Gen 2 and the Snapdragon 4 Gen 4.

Similarly, the camera app on many foldable phones, such as the Oppo Find N5, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>, and even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x-fold-5-review">Vivo X Fold 5</a>, offers a feature that splits the camera into two halves, with the viewfinder on the right and previews of recent shots on the left.</p><p>While most foldable smartphone makers have offered this feature, Google surprisingly missed out.

However, as with every piece of software, these updates are not always perfect.</p><p>Some system app updates contain issues as well, and many of us have had to roll back to a previous version of an app to continue using it as it worked before the update. One of the easiest ways to do that until now was to go directly to the Play Store listing for that system app and tap the Uninstall updates button.</p><p>And while this option was convenient since you didn't need to dig into any settings, it seems like it's going away.</p><h2 id="rolling-back-system-apps-now-needs-extra-steps-2">Rolling back system apps now needs extra steps</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6LRN4wW4DEJfhgH6ggFKaT" name="play-store-uninstall-app-updates" alt="Play Store app listings with Uninstall app update button gone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6LRN4wW4DEJfhgH6ggFKaT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sanuj Bhatia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-play-store-uninstall-button-2-3624705/">Android Authority</a>, the button to uninstall updates for system apps in the Google Play Store is now gone. The change appears to be widespread and is already rolling out to all devices, and it isn't tied to any specific Play Store version. For me, the option is also gone on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-series-your-ultimate-guide">Google Pixel 10 Pro</a> running Play Store version 49.1.33-31.</p><p>While the Play Store listing previously showed an Uninstall button for these system apps, the option is now gone entirely, leaving a blank white space where the button used to be. Moreover, as the report suggests, apps that don't show up in the app drawer, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-auto-review">Android Auto</a> and Android System WebView, are also affected by this change.</p><p>We don't yet know why Google is doing this, and there doesn't seem to be a clear reason behind the change for now. However, the option disappearing from the Play Store doesn't mean you can no longer downgrade or uninstall system app updates.</p><p>You can still uninstall system app updates by going to the app's settings, tapping the three-dot menu, and selecting Uninstall updates. It's just that the option has now been removed from the Play Store.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The problem is most likely due to Google’s move to newer software. In September, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/wear-os/google-phasing-out-wear-os-weather-app">stopped offering the Weather app for devices running Wear OS 6</a>.</p><p>The plan was to push users toward manufacturer-specific apps, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/pixel-weather-app-coming-to-pixel-watch">new Pixel Weather on the Pixel Watch 2, 3, and 4</a>. However, Google explicitly stated that the legacy app would continue working for anyone who already had it installed.</p><p>That promise has run into trouble. The prevailing theory — at least on Reddit — is that Google pushed an update intended for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a> that inadvertently broke compatibility with older firmware versions. Since the original Pixel Watch still uses older software, the app and the watch are not working together.</p><p>Google’s support representative said the team is aware of the issue and is working on a firmware update to fix it. However, there is no clear timeline for when the fix will arrive. This is frustrating for users, especially since these devices are failing at a basic task.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This includes devices like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-gen-2">Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses</a> and other wearables that can quietly record photos, videos, or audio without drawing attention.</p><p>This update is part of the cruise line’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.msccruisesusa.com/manage-booking/before-you-go/luggage" target="_blank">luggage and prohibited items policy</a>. Anything that can secretly record data is now not allowed in shared spaces.

So, you probably can’t wear them in dining halls, pool decks, theaters, or lounges without the crew stepping in.</p><p>If you are caught wearing them in common areas, staff could confiscate them. The only place you can safely use your smart glasses appears to be the private confines of your cabin.

The publication cites Bloomberg reporter <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/yoolimleenews/status/1999357299547357259">Yoolim Lee</a>, who was reporting on Samsung's initial launch of the TriFold in South Korea. According to Lee, consumers in South Korea were waiting outside stores for nearly 24 hours to get their hands on the Galaxy Z TriFold. The publication states that, after the device launched, it "sold out within minutes."</p><p>It was stated that Samsung provided roughly 20 retailers across its home country with TriFold inventory in preparation for the debut. However, in-store supplies were quickly snatched up, as was its stock online.</p><p>While it was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/report-says-samsungs-galaxy-z-trifold-will-be-incredibly-sparse-and-this-is-why">previously reported</a> that Samsung was only looking to manufacture ~20,000 to ~30,000 TriFold units, its quick sellout could be seen as a positive. Nevertheless, the publication reports that Samsung has already started "collecting restock sign-ups," potentially indicating another round of Galaxy Z TriFolds sometime in the future.</p><h2 id="this-is-the-trifold-2">This is the TriFold</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oXYnF9FoswnR2ANM367cHQ" name="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold hands-on testing at Dubai Mall on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oXYnF9FoswnR2ANM367cHQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/its-official-samsungs-galaxy-z-trifold-launch">announced the Galaxy Z TriFold</a> earlier this month, cementing in our minds a device that had been rumored for a while. Android Central's Harish Jonnalagadda <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-hands-on">went hands-on</a> with the phone recently and noticed one key aspect: its design is much better than originally theorized. Compared to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-is-the-most-exciting-phone-around">Huawei's Mate XT</a>, Samsung's TriFold went a little further with its inner screen and cover display by offering 120Hz (the former goes to 90Hz).</p><p>Jonnalagadda highlights that Samsung only plans to produce roughly 500 units for its UAE launch, highlighting a trend with its first go at the form-factor.</p><p>Similarly, during the phone's launch, Samsung announced that it plans to bring the Galaxy Z TriFold to the U.S. early in 2026. Just how many models the country should expect is still unknown at this time. What the U.S. can likely expect is a steep price tag. The TriFold went for KRW 3.59 million, which equates to ~$2,430. The Galaxy Z TriFold sports a 10-inch display when fully opened, as well as a thin 3.9mm build.</p><p>Consumers will also find a 200MP main camera on its rear panel, paired with an ultra-wide 12MP camera, and a 10MP telephoto sensor.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The first major update taps Gemini for improved translations for more nuanced instances, such as local expressions and slang. Google states its AI will attempt to provide a more accurate translation of phrases, rather than "a literal word-for-word translation."</p><p>This update is rolling out today in India and the U.S. in English and over 20 languages, including Spanish, Japanese, and German.</p><p>The second update rolling out soon concerns Translate's "language learning." Now, Google is giving users who take their practices seriously a challenge. It's a feature you'd find in other similar apps, like Duolingo, as Translate receives "Streaks," which tracks how many days you've shown up to practice.</p><p>Additionally, Translate is bringing its learning tools to 20 more countries this month.</p><h2 id="connections-through-ai-translations-2">Connections through AI translations</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6F3oGXf8dfM" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>The final update for Translate isn't (necessarily) an update, as Google states it's expanding a beta regarding "real-time translations."</p><p>This feature directly calls on Gemini's speech-to-speech capabilities. Google states the Translate app will work to "preserve the tone, emphasis, and cadence of each speaker to create more natural translations." What's more, this feature can work when you're wearing headphones. Google teases that users wearing headphones can open the Translate app while watching a show in another language or while listening to a lecture, and listen to a translation of what's said in real-time.</p><p>The beta will provide a "Live Translate" button for users to tap to get started. This expanded beta is arriving in the Translate app so more users can get involved and offer feedback. It's slowly becoming available today (Dec 12) in the Translate app on Android for the U.S., Mexico, and India.</p><p>Google teases that this feature will work with "any headphones" and features support for over 70 languages. Those with iPhones, and in other countries, can expect this to arrive in 2026.</p><p>Google Translate's small "challenges" update, which brings streaks to the fold, builds on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-translate-gemini-in-customized-language-practice-update">language practice patch</a> from the summer. Tapping "practice" gets users started, as they inform the AI how well they understand a language. This is your "level." After which, the app will help you with goals for your daily practice sessions.</p> ]]></dc:content>

As described in our glowing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-3-review">4.5/5-star review</a>, the flagship tablet has an incredible price-to-performance ratio, with a stunning 13.2-inch LCD 144Hz display, the unrivalled Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, and a thin, lightweight build straight out of the box.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="AFPHG3zJvf8SDsRGkFumQN" name="Hades 2 via GameSir GameHub on the OnePlus Pad 3" alt="Hades 2 via GameSir GameHub on the OnePlus Pad 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AFPHG3zJvf8SDsRGkFumQN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Thanks to the 12GB of RAM and 256GB of onboard storage, the OnePlus Pad 3 is powerful enough for gaming and large file management alike, while the 12,140mAh battery should last you up to 17 hours on a single charge. The device also boasts an 8-speaker stereo audio system, which is just as cool as it sounds, and there are plenty of first-party accessories to trick out the tablet to your heart's desire.</p><p>As with any device, there are trade-offs with the OnePlus Pad 3. You won't get as many AI features as you would with a Samsung Galaxy Tab or iPad, and the lack of a microSD slot is a bit disappointing (although a portable SSD will get the job done just as well). All in all, these drawbacks are pretty minor, and I'd choose the OnePlus Pad 3 over its mainstream rivals any day of the week — <em>especially </em>when you slap on a Black Friday-level discount.</p><h2 id="more-holiday-shopping-2025-quick-links-7">More holiday shopping 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 50% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>major discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The 2024 device boasts a vibrant display with weeks of battery life and a responsive stylus pen. The main problem with the e-ink tablet is its price, but now that the 2025 model has come along, Best Buy is knocking it down to a much more reasonable $280. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/amazon-kindle-scribe-32gb-2024-tungsten/J39TLSYV7G" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="a8e8c686-e2b6-411f-8b3c-14f60740ced7" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$419.99" data-dimension48="$419.99" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p>To be clear, <strong>this discount is NOT for the updated 2025 Kindle Scribe</strong>. This historic price drop is only available on the 2024 model. If you'd rather spend 500 bucks on the latest model, Amazon is currently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DVQQGMCZ"><strong>offering some trade-in credit</strong></a><strong> </strong>(although it won't arrive by Christmas).</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JQ7uNrmzNw9HdwgWSitEbA" name="Amazon-Kindle-Scribe-Active-Canvas.jpg" alt="A person writes on an e-book using the Amazon Kindle Scribe" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JQ7uNrmzNw9HdwgWSitEbA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Amazon)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="should-i-buy-the-amazon-kindle-scribe-2">Should I buy the Amazon Kindle Scribe?</h2><p>Whether you're a reader, artist, or compulsive notetaker, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-amazon-kindle">2024 Kindle Scribe is a great device</a> for getting things done. You get a 10.2-inch 300ppi glare-free display with an included stylus that works straight out of the box, plus weeks of battery life depending on usage. The notetaking function itself feels almost indistinguishable from pen on paper, and you even get a collapsing "eraser" on the end of the stylus. </p><p>Another major selling point of the Kindle Scribe (2024) is its AI features. These tools can be used to convert messy handwriting into something more readable, or you can customize the length and tone of your notes to make them feel a bit more refined.  </p><h2 id="should-i-buy-the-2024-model-or-the-new-kindle-scribe-2025-2">Should I buy the 2024 model or the new Kindle Scribe (2025)?</h2><p>This historic discount on the 2024 Kindle Scribe is probably happening because the tablet has been officially supplanted by a newer model. While the Kindle Scribe (2025) does have some significant upgrades over its predecessor — the display is larger and more lightweight, for instance — I'm not sure it's worth the $500 price tag.  </p><p>For over $200 less, you can get the 2024 tablet and enjoy a very similar experience, especially if you simply want a device for reading and casual note-taking. If, on the other hand, you <em>really</em> want to drop 500 bucks on a tablet, I'd skip the Kindles altogether and go for something more comprehensive, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-3-review">OnePlus Pad 3</a>. </p><h2 id="holiday-shopping-2025-quick-links-7">Holiday shopping 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 50% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>major discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

And while Google director Juston Payne said these AI glasses will "help bring this category into existence," Meta brought smart glasses and XR into the mainstream first. So it's fair to speculate how Google and Samsung will crack Meta's AI glasses stranglehold.</p><p>We don't know how Warby Parker and Gentle Monster will design these glasses, nor do we have camera or battery specs yet. But the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a> UI and apps felt polished and consumer-ready in my hour-long demo. I already know what it'll be like to use these glasses in daily life.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jpxLZyY5GMk" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>As a result, I expect the display-free Samsung glasses and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-gen-2">Ray-Ban Meta glasses</a> to have remarkably similar software, including "live" AI advice and translation. The mono-HUD glasses will, likewise, resemble the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-glasses">Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses</a>, with their petite app widgets, turn-by-turn navigation, and other shared apps.</p><p>They're similar enough that people may end up choosing their smart glasses based on Warby Parker, Gentle Monster, or Ray-Ban/Oakley styles, not the AI behind it.</p><p>That said, I've already noticed three key differences that could help the Android XR smart glasses stand out and offer key advantages over what Meta offers. This doesn't mean these glasses will be <em>better</em>, as Meta has three generations of hardware experience that's paid off so far. But it proves that long-time Meta glasses wearers should be paying close attention.</p><h2 id="gemini-has-one-key-advantage-over-meta-ai-apps-2">Gemini has one key advantage over Meta AI: Apps</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2256px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LgQbzhPfbs6njQag6t8sBY" name="Android-XR-ask-AI" alt="A video still of a person wearing Google glasses asking about a bird on their palm, with a pop-up text showing info on its type." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LgQbzhPfbs6njQag6t8sBY.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2256" height="1269" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'm not going to get into the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> vs. Llama debate.

For example, pulling info from Messages or Maps and then creating a Keep note from the result.</p><p>This interconnectivity with other apps will let the HUD display a preview of your Nest Doorbell feed, Google TV controls, a pop-up of a Gmail subject line, and more. And it's not just for Google apps: the deep Android integration means <em>any</em> Gemini-compatible apps should be compatible. Meta supports the essential phone, messaging, music, and social apps, but Google could have an "ecosystem," at least on Android; iOS users could have a more specialized experience.</p><h2 id="google-s-photography-expertise-will-be-vital-2">Google's photography expertise will be vital</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="nzjUrGrpqXGxzKKBTBfWkX" name="Ray-Ban-Meta-Gen-2-close-up-front-side" alt="A photo of the Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) smart glasses sitting on a rock, angled to focus on the right camera cutout." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nzjUrGrpqXGxzKKBTBfWkX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When I reviewed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-gen-2-review">Ray-Ban Gen 2s</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oakley-meta-vanguard-smart-glasses-review">Oakley Meta Vanguards</a>, I appreciated the high-res action photos captured with such petite sensors, as well as how well they stabilize videos, so I appear to slide forward rather than rock and bounce with every step. A lot of postprocessing goes into making this work.</p><p>My expectation is that Google and Samsung will handle computational photography at least as well as Meta. They both make some of the best camera phones, specializing in areas such as motion capture, AI-powered zoom, edge detection with targeted blurring, and more.</p><p>Of course, Samsung can't fit Ultra-quality sensors with zoom into glasses frames; "physics will get in the way," as Payne explained, particularly for low-light photos.

Disco, as a browser, functions quite similarly to what users already experience from Gemini. Upon opening, the AI browser operates like a chat, allowing users to ask for assistance with planning a trip or more. The AI will respond in kind, offering links for suggested places to go; however, it's when these links (tabs) are compiled that we get Disco's first main feature: GenTabs.</p><p>According to Google, GenTabs "are generated based on your specific tabs and your specific goal."</p><p>In one of the company's examples, the user is trying to prepare a seven-day meal plan that helps them manage their cholesterol. Disco's AI opened a few links to get them started, but it went further by turning those links and the information available into a "custom, interactive app." From this "app," Disco displays the days of the week, and when clicked, the user can quickly see what meals they should make for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.</p><p>Google states, "there is no end to what you can make," as GenTabs can make Match Games through its custom apps, data about science, gardening, and much more. What GenTabs generates is all based on the user's prompt; the more specific you are, the better. For gardening, if you're in the planning stages, and Disco's AI knows this, it can create a grid where the user can place the icons of what they would plant.</p><h2 id="more-helpful-ai-2">More helpful AI</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1074px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.87%;"><img id="akmwxSq29XbsHrDow88LmT" name="google-labs-disco-gentabs-meal-prep" alt="Google Labs kickstarts its "Disco" AI browser experiment, which brings GenTabs: a custom app in a tab that is showing a user what meals they should make to help their cholesterol." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/akmwxSq29XbsHrDow88LmT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1074" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google Labs)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If Disco is of interest, users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf7l1a9m_JlpeZGKF5iF6BwXwU9TUhMaDXXHo-ZuXqXWTnPHg/viewform">can join the waitlist</a> for Google's experiment.

You must have a Google Pixel 6 or newer running Android 14 or higher. Additionally, the Google Phone app needs to be updated to the latest version. The company also notes that while call recording is widely available, features can vary based on your country or region.</p><p>After you enable call recording on a Pixel phone, you'll be able to record individual calls or set conditions when recordings will start automatically for certain calls.</p><h2 id="how-to-record-calls-on-your-pixel-phone-2">How to record calls on your Pixel phone</h2><p>To start, call recording must be enabled in the Google Phone app. Here's how to turn on and configure Pixel call recording:</p><p>1.

After accepting a call, tap the <strong>Turn on</strong> button in the <strong>Call Recording </strong>box in the call interface.</p><p>2. Tap <strong>Record</strong> to start the recording, noting that an audio message will play letting everyone know the call is being recorded.</p><p>3.

The gigantic foldable will serve some serious screen real estate, bringing 10 inches of fabulous AMOLED in a neatly folded form factor.</p><p>Thanks to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-introducing-galaxy-z-trifold-shape-whats-next-mobile-innovation">official press release</a> posted by Samsung, we can confidently say that the Galaxy Z TriFold will boast a 5,600 mAh three-cell battery system. Samsung is pairing this generous battery with 45W fast wired charging via USB-C, and of course, 15W fast wireless charging as well. The Trifold will also support Wireless PowerShare, so users will be able to charge their earbuds or other phones with the Trifold in a pinch.</p><p>The other specifications of the device sound mighty powerful, too. Everything from the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset to the 200MP camera sounds incredible. It's a shame that magnetic Qi2 support is missing in action, but hopefully, Samsung will tackle it with the next iteration of the TriFold.</p><p>For now, we are excited to see how the U.S. launch of the long-awaited Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold will proceed. The tri-foldable market is very small, and so far, only Huawei has made our jaws drop with its stunning, impossibly thin <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-is-the-most-exciting-phone-around">Mate XT</a>.</p><p>Our reviewer Harish Jonnalagadda called the Huawei Mate XT "the most exciting phone" he had used in a long time, so Samsung has some major competition to beat. Can Samsung, a well-established and respected name in the foldables market, knock over Huawei's crown? While Jonnalagadda's hands-on went incredibly well, it's hard to say for sure until the device has been tested in the long run and reviewed in depth. We'll have to wait until Q1 2026 to find out, because that's the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-release-date">tentative launch window</a> of the device.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="e34f7713-c353-4408-acf7-79a6c8e26c26">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/isAoL5q4Ju5wkYovSpMZSb.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>A new era of foldables</strong></em></p><p>Samsung is throwing its hat in the ring with the Galaxy Z TriFold.

Now, Disney has changed direction by investing $1 billion in equity in OpenAI, marking a major shift in how studios work with generative AI.</p><p>Beginning in early 2026, this partnership will connect <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/openai-sora-video-generator-vs-google-veo-3">OpenAI’s Sora text-to-video model</a> with Disney’s large library of intellectual property. Users will be able to create short videos featuring over 200 licensed characters from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, and Star Wars, according to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://openai.com/index/disney-sora-agreement/" target="_blank">joint announcement</a> from both companies.</p><p>This includes popular characters such as Iron Man, Captain America, The Mandalorian, and Rey. Animated favorites like Mickey Mouse, Minnie, Simba, Mufasa, Stitch, and Baymax are also available. Users can access well-known costumes, props, and vehicles, and generate custom Frozen or Toy Story clips almost instantly by typing a prompt.</p><h2 id="strict-limits-apply-2">Strict limits apply</h2><p>However, there are clear restrictions. Disney limits use to animated, masked, and creature characters only.</p><p>That means this deal explicitly excludes actor likenesses and voices. You won't be generating a digital Robert Downey Jr. or cloning Mark Hamill’s voice for your clips.</p><p>While the tech is impressive, the deal might spark fears that democratizing these characters devalues the hand-crafted storytelling Disney is known for.</p><p>Despite these concerns, Disney plans to embrace user-generated content by curating select fan-made videos to stream on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/disney-plus">Disney Plus</a>. This experiment could either boost fan engagement or affect the service’s reputation.</p><p>In addition to consumer features, Disney will use OpenAI’s tools internally. The company plans to become a major customer, using ChatGPT to help employees develop new products and experiences.</p><p>The rollout is planned for early 2026. Whether the result is a new era of creativity or a flood of digital noise remains to be seen.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This beta, exclusive to New Zealand users for the time being, lets users generate a playlist that abides by their interests, curiosities, and more. Tapping "Create" at the bottom right in the app is where users will find Prompted Playlists. From there, users can "describe" and dictate everything about the playlist.</p><p>If you're looking to get into metalcore, you can tell the playlist to start there, and then offer suggestions you've never heard before. If you're in your K-Pop era, then describe the kind of playlist you want to listen to.</p><p>The post states that Prompted Playlists leverages "your entire Spotify listening history, all the way back to day one."</p><p>After writing your prompt, users can hop into "set updates." This is where you can channel your inner Spotify by setting how often the playlist should refresh its content.  Users can decide to have it update daily at specific times or weekly. The "ideas" button is just what you'd expect: suggestions on where to start if the ole noggin's not sure where to begin.</p><p>After everything's said and done, and the playlist has been generated, Spotify states it will offer a little story behind every song. The company says the purpose of this is to make your generated playlist "feel alive."</p><h2 id="prompt-generate-listen-2">Prompt, generate, listen</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bsfbgD4hpoi4xXvmyjAksg" name="spotify-prompted-playlists-example" alt="Spotify's "Prompted Playlists" put you in control, giving you space to describe the playlist you want to listen to and control how often it updates." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bsfbgD4hpoi4xXvmyjAksg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Spotify)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Spotify informs users that, since Prompted Playlists is in beta, its experience may change as time progresses. This is in part due to user feedback and changes the platform envisions. What's more, Spotify states that the feature is wrapped in its bigger goals for the platform moving forward. The post highlights an interest in creating a more "personal" and "responsive" musical experience.</p><p>Spotify wants the user to take control of their music. The post teases that 2026 will hold more for listeners and artists. Regarding Prompted Playlists, there's no word on a U.S. beta; however, if all goes well, users in the region might not wait long.</p><p>We're starting to close out 2025, and with that comes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify/spotify-wrapped-2025-is-here">the usual Spotify Wrapped</a>. This year, the platform shook things up with "listening age" and "top albums." Users, of course, still got the usual "top songs" for the year, as well as some analytics behind the many music genres they listened to. Spotify Wrapped 2025 ended with files about you, which are detailed notes about your most diverse listening days and how your tastes might've changed throughout the year.</p><p>Elsewhere, an update last month made it easier for users to switch with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify/spotify-is-making-it-easier-to-switch-with-tunemymusic-playlist-transfers">TuneMyMusic's library transfer service</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Satechi-OntheGoTM-Magnetic-Multiport-Ethernet/dp/B0FWR19DW7">now available for $59 on Amazon</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5095px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="DvxJfVB2fPMNA48CRpEytg" name="Satechi OntheGo 7-in-1 USB-C Hub" alt="Satechi OntheGo 7-in-1 USB-C Hub testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DvxJfVB2fPMNA48CRpEytg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5095" height="2870" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Obviously, there's no shortage of USB-C hubs, but what made the OntheGo 7-in-1 USB-C Hub a great choice for my own use case is the fact that it has magnets on the underside. This allows the hub to be attached to a phone, or the outside of a notebook, making it that much more convenient. The hub is MagSafe ready, and I didn't see any issues using it with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-17-pro-review">iPhone 17 Pro</a> or my Honor MagicBook 16 notebook.
