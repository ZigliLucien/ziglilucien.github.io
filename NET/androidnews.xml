While the brand always did a great job with the hardware, it wasn't until the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi/poco-f7-ultra-review">F7 Ultra</a> that it was able to deliver a phone with a great camera, and the F8 Ultra builds on that foundation. In my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi/poco-f8-ultra-review">F8 Ultra review</a>, I called it one of the best phones in the $800 category, and I stand by that — it really is a great all-rounder.</p><p>There's just one problem: POCO isn't bringing the phone to India. At the launch of the F8 Pro and F8 Ultra, POCO indicated that it sold 94 million devices globally in its seven-year history, and that's pretty good. While the brand didn't go into regional figures, India is POCO's biggest market by a considerable amount; its presence in the country and positioning as an affordable brand has allowed it to make significant inroads.</p><p>It's this positioning that's hurting the brand now. I asked POCO India and global spokespeople for an on-the-record statement about why its latest device isn't coming to India, but I didn't get one. That said, it isn't hard to understand why POCO is reticent to launch the F8 Ultra in India; the brand is still seen as a budget player, and it just doesn't have the cachet to sell a phone that costs over $700 in the country — there wouldn't be any takers.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4901px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.34%;"><img id="Y8GPUuRGuXuRsVSQyeZxTN" name="POCO F8 Ultra" alt="POCO F8 Ultra review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Y8GPUuRGuXuRsVSQyeZxTN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4901" height="2761" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Xiaomi — POCO's parent brand — knows this well, as it has tried several times in the past to sell its costliest phones in the country to no avail. That's why we didn't get Mi-branded flagships for a while, and it's only in the last two years that it started selling its Ultra models in India. I see this as a prestige play, where Xiaomi is able to raise its brand profile by marketing devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review">Xiaomi 14 Ultra</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-ultra-review">Xiaomi 15 Ultra</a> in the country, and this is similar to what OPPO and Vivo also do with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/oppo-find-x9-pro-review">Find X9 Pro</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x300-pro-review">X300 Pro</a>.</p><p>With POCO, however, the focus is still on the budget category. This is why the brand didn't bring the F7 Ultra to the country earlier in the year, only debuting the budget-focused F7 instead. POCO positions its products at a younger audience, and that ostensibly means catering to the budget segment with devices in the C and M series. I'm positive that these entry-level and budget phones outsell even the likes of the X7 Pro, and in that context, it's easy to see why POCO didn't bring the F8 Ultra to India.</p><p>Even then, I think the brand should have taken a gamble this time around. Phone pricing is trending up in India — like all global markets — and this year's flagships highlight that. Vivo sub-brand iQOO's devices are positioned against POCO's products, and the iQOO 15 debuted in India for ₹72,999 ($811), a staggering increase of ₹18,000 ($200) from the iQOO 13's ₹54,999 ($611) pricing last year.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5030px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="Ui8kXS5HDi7UrBVJ2YHY7N" name="POCO F8 Ultra" alt="POCO F8 Ultra review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ui8kXS5HDi7UrBVJ2YHY7N.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5030" height="2833" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With a significant price increase this year and the likes of Realme and other brands also rolling out phones in this category, this would have been the ideal year for POCO to bring its costlier portfolio of products to the country. The F8 Ultra is positioned well against the iQOO 15 and Realme GT 8 Pro, and given POCO's recognition as a value-focused brand, it would have sold a decent number of phones by undercutting the F8 Ultra against its key rivals.</p><p>After all, it was this exact strategy that allowed POCO to rise in prominence with the F1 all those years ago. The F1 was an outlier in the sheer amount of value it delivered, and it's clear that we won't get devices like that again; the F2 Pro was proof of that. But to not bring the F8 Ultra to India feels like a short-sighted move, considering when other brands are willing to take a bet on the country.</p><p>If nothing else, this is hurting POCO's image in the country. I get that devices like the F8 Ultra won't sell in anywhere as many numbers as the brand's budget phones, but having marquee phones to market only elevates a brand's profile, and Samsung does this to great effect globally. It positions Galaxy S and Z devices as aspirational products, and sells millions of Galaxy A and FE devices with the clear implication that they're just as good as the flagships — POCO (and Xiaomi in general) doesn't seem to get this strategy.</p><p>The way Xiaomi and POCO position their brands in the U.K. is drastically different to India, and I find that puzzling considering both brands are actually recognizable in the country. POCO is doing all the right things when it comes to the actual hardware, and it now needs to get its strategy in order and ensure its best devices are sold in its biggest market.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It feels like a pressure gauge, measuring everything from political flashpoints to new AI trends and a nonstop pop culture cycle. Looking at both the global and U.S. lists, some patterns are clear: AI is now part of daily life, politics filled the headlines, and entertainment kept surprising us in unexpected ways.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/gemini">Gemini</a> topped the global chart, showing just how much AI has become part of everyday conversation. DeepSeek, another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/deepseek-already-had-a-usd1-trillion-impact-and-its-just-getting-started">big AI model</a>, also made it into the global top 10.</p><p>In the U.S., that curiosity looked a bit different.

There were also moments that shocked people around the world. Searches for Charlie Kirk jumped worldwide, and not just for political reasons. His assassination and passing became the most-searched global news event and the top news topic in the U.S., leading to days of nonstop coverage and speculation.</p><p>Events like the situation in Iran, the LA fires, the US government shutdown, and the election of Pope Leo XIV kept people checking for updates. Natural disasters such as Hurricane Melissa and the Kamchatka earthquake also led to more crisis-related searches than usual.</p><p>Entertainment also drew a lot of attention. Around the world, Anora and Superman were the most-searched movies, while in the U.S., KPop Demon Hunters was the top film people looked up.</p><h2 id="pop-culture-tastes-are-divided-2">Pop culture tastes are divided</h2><p>For television, Monster: The Ed Gein Story was the most popular show worldwide, while The Hunting Wives led in the U.S. If it seemed like Taylor Swift released something new every month, you were right. She dominated global lyric searches and made up half of the U.S. top 10 songs list.</p><p>Sports fans were active, too. The FIFA Club World Cup was the most-searched sporting event worldwide. In the U.S., fans helped the Seattle Mariners and Oklahoma City Thunder reach the top team rankings. Terence Crawford, Shedeur Sanders, and Rory McIlroy were among the most-searched athletes globally, showing how sports interests shifted this year.</p><p>The internet’s love for rabbit holes showed up in some unusual trends, too. There were spikes in “Holy airball” memes and recipe searches like hot honey cottage cheese beef bowls and dumpling bakes. Travel searches also reflected bigger changes: worldwide, Kyoto Station and Kew Gardens were popular on Google Maps, while Americans planned trips to Boston, Seattle, and Tokyo.</p><p>If anything, 2025 showed that our searches reflect what we care about, what worries us, and what we want to learn next.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Starting December 10, the platform will automatically sign out users under 16. It’s a fundamental change to how the platform works for young people, and Google isn't hiding its frustration.</p><p>What was initially billed as a crackdown on social media apps has now expanded to include YouTube, despite <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/intl/en-au/our-opening-statement-to-the-senate-environment-and-communications-references-committee/" target="_blank">Google’s insistence</a> that YouTube doesn’t operate like Facebook, Instagram, or Snapchat. But regulators ruled otherwise, and the platform must comply with the Social Media Minimum Age Act.</p><p>The timing and scope have caught parents, teens, and creators off guard. For many Australians, YouTube was more than just a social feed. It offered entertainment, homework help, and a space for creators. Now, all those features disappear as soon as a user is found to be under 16.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:401px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:216.96%;"><img id="hrxiVeWY3EDS4EcDBk9XqX" name="youtube-ban-for-teens" alt="YouTube pop-up message telling teens in Australia they need to be 16 or older to use the platform" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hrxiVeWY3EDS4EcDBk9XqX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="401" height="870" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Instead, they will be pushed into a stripped-down YouTube experience where they can watch videos but can’t like, subscribe, comment, or upload. Parental controls disappear entirely because YouTube’s supervision tools only work when a user is signed in.</p><p>Teen creators lose access to their dashboards and can’t manage or update their channels. Their content stays online, but they can’t touch it again until their 16th birthday.</p><p>YouTube says none of this data is deleted; it’s simply frozen, waiting for teens to age back into their own profiles.</p><h2 id="google-claims-it-s-unsafe-2">Google claims it's unsafe</h2><p>However, it is important to note a critical distinction: the ban restricts account access, not access to the entire YouTube site. Young users can still view videos as guests, but lose all personalized features provided by an account, such as subscriptions and recommendations.</p><p>Google’s argument is straightforward. By forcing kids to use YouTube without an account, the ban removes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube/minimum-streaming-age-youtube-requirement-increases-parents-details">safety measures</a> built over the last decade. Rachel Lord, a senior public policy manager at Google, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/intl/en-au/products/whats-changing-on-youtube-in-australia/" target="_blank">called</a> the regulation "rushed" and warned that it will "make Australian kids less safe on YouTube."</p><p>On the flip side, the Australian government isn't buying it. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/society-equity/youtube-says-it-will-comply-with-australias-teen-social-media-ban-2025-12-03/" target="_blank">Reuters</a> reports that Communications Minister Anika Wells fired back, noting that if YouTube is admitting its platform is unsafe for signed-out users, "that’s a problem that YouTube needs to fix."</p> ]]></dc:content>

The South Korean OEM's video is rather short, only coming in at 30 seconds, but this brief clip offers a subtle glimpse into what we might expect. Samsung opens its teaser by stating, "In silence, we listened," likely referring to the various grievances Galaxy users have had over the years with its Exynos chips.</p><p>The company then goes on to make two big, dare we say, promises about the upcoming Exynos chip.</p><p>Samsung says the Exynos 2600 has been "refined at the core," before rolling into another statement stating optimizations have arrived "at every level." The company is really trying to stoke the hype flames this year with the Exynos 2600, adding that the new chip is designed to "express the exceptional" in its devices, and likely its users. Unfortunately, Samsung doesn't offer anything with more substance about the chip, like something we can really dig into.</p><p>However, the company's description box held more, as it says, "The next Exynos is coming." Samsung highlights that the chip is "coming soon," which might feed into the rumors that it will be placed into the Galaxy S26.</p><h2 id="will-it-be-different-this-time-2">Will it be different this time?</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7jfpNre0JGA" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>We've been going through Exynos 2600 rumors like nobody's business, but they claim one thing: that it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-may-feature-an-exynos-chip-that-outpaces-apple-and-qualcomm">going to be snappy</a>. Rumors in October make the claim that Samsung's new in-house chip will thrust it into contention with chips from Apple and Qualcomm. Supposedly, the company has taken strides to improve the speed of the Exynos 2600, producing a snappier and graphically stronger SoC for its Galaxy phones.</p><p>We've also heard repeated rumors that the chip is built on Samsung's 2nm process, not 3nm, which you'd get from TSMC for Qualcomm's Snapdragon. AI was another object of discussion, as Samsung will look to really force its AI software onto the Exynos 2600, improving its performance to "surpass" Apple.</p><p>Just last month, it was speculated that Samsung's Exynos 2600 could <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-custom-exynos-chip-might-bring-its-galaxy-s26-series-price-down">bring a small price drop</a> to the chip's target series: the Galaxy S26. Supposedly, the regions that could see the chip (Korea, Europe) might see a ~$20 to ~$30 price drop. There were reportedly concerns about the chip's true power potential on smartphones, despite Samsung rocking its 2nm process.</p><p>Performance has always been a concern with Samsung's Exynos chip; just look at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-fe-exynos-2500-impact-rumors">the struggles it had</a> with its 2500 series. There's also the fact that Samsung, when it does utilize its Exynos chip, shies away from a U.S. Galaxy launch with the chip due to market perception, as most lean toward Qualcomm's Snapdragon.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Google has quietly removed the “Call Home” button, a beloved feature that allowed you to ring your smart displays directly from your phone.</p><p>Introduced in 2019, the feature made it easy to call a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-display">smart display</a> in the house without needing extra phone numbers or apps. Many parents used it to check in on kids while running errands.</p><p>Now, when users open the Google Home app, the familiar button that used to appear above “Broadcast” is missing.

You can set up Google Meet calling on Nest devices, but it requires assigning unique Google accounts and jumping through setup steps most households won’t bother with. It works, technically, but it’s nothing like the simple, friction-free Call Home button people relied on for years.</p><p>This change seems like another example of Google making its services simpler but at the expense of features people are used to. We have seen similar changes before, like when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-tasks-integration-is-arriving-for-keep-to-replace-reminders">Google Keep reminders moved to Tasks</a>.</p><p>Now, the question is whether Google will bring back this feature in a new form or if it is gone for good. Until Google releases a statement, Nest owners have to find workarounds or rethink their smart-home setup.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The company states this feature is designed to help viewers do one thing: "getting you to what you want to watch—fast." After activating Alexa Plus on your Fire TV, Amazon states users can describe a movie scene, naturally, as if in a conversation, to the AI.</p><p>The post states that this new "jump to scene" feature lets users be as descriptive as possible. If you're aware of the actors or actresses involved, share that with the AI; even things like a character's name, a quote, and more are useful.</p><p>As one might expect, this feature only works between Alexa Plus and your Amazon Prime Video subscription. The AI will take your "jump to the..." scene description and run it through Prime Video to find the appropriate match. However, as this rolls out today (Dec 3), it seems that not <em>everything </em>is there for the AI to reach back into. Amazon states Alexa Plus can leverage "thousands" of available movie titles, as well as "tens of thousands of indexed scenes," but there's room to grow.</p><p>Amazon plans to continue to build upon Alexa Plus' knowledge base of movies, so users can—potentially—find a match to any scene they're looking up. There <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/fire-tv-alexa-plus-jump-to-the-scene#:~:text=How%20does%20the%20new%20find%20a%20scene%20feature%20work%20on%20Fire%20TV%3F">are a few examples</a> of how the "jump to scene" feature can work for viewers to peruse.

As the AI positions itself as a more personalized entertainment AI, especially when on Fire TV, its Canadian debut came with "culturally tailored features" for those consumers.

The company revealed the new Fire TV Stick 4K Select, as well as two new Omni QLED TVs, a new 2-Series model, and a new 4-Series model.

Well, now you know, too.</p><p>This is one of those times when knowing what it is isn't the important part, though.

By that I mean you can make a million edits, and the parts you're not changing look just like they did at the beginning. You can edit your images so they look better, turn yourself into a robot pirate, or turn your dog into a pet chicken made out of lemon peels. It's pretty wild or mild, depending on what you want. Here's how you can get started.</p><h2 id="how-to-use-nano-banana-2">How to use Nano Banana</h2><p>The best part is that it's really easy to use.

The steps are all the same, though.</p><p>I went to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gemini.google.com/" target="_blank">Gemini on the web</a> and was faced with a text box. Right under that box was a little button marked "<strong>Tools</strong>," so I clicked it and chose <strong>Create Images</strong> to get everything fired up. Then my "creative" side takes over.</p><p>"<em>Create an image of a cat bowling. Draw it as a comic with the cat walking on two legs.</em>" I asked. So it did. <strong>Pro Tip: </strong>Being very specific in your prompt saves you a lot of time.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1068px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:76.22%;"><img id="XaCbDyfF76JBFuxp46GaJ9" name="nano-banana-cat-bowling" alt="AI generated image of a cat bolwing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XaCbDyfF76JBFuxp46GaJ9.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1068" height="814" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The result was pretty much what I expected, and the whole thing took about 10 seconds.

Where Nano Banana really shines is its consistency. I went through and asked for a bunch of silly changes like having the cat wear a cowboy hat and a green tuxedo, making the bowling ball glow like an alien orb, and having the bowling pins be fried chicken legs. Nano Banana was happy to do all of that, but the cat still looks <em>exactly</em> the same as in the original, albeit more cartoonish and brighter because I asked for that, too.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1024px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="wfhJXGtfCXQYr9PspD6hY" name="cat-bowling-nano-banana-2" alt="Nano Banana generated image of a cat bowling" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wfhJXGtfCXQYr9PspD6hY.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1024" height="1024" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For the pièce de résistance, I asked Gemini to "Turn the cat into a 1/7 scale collectable figurine on a desk with toy packaging beside it."

All of this can be done with a picture of yourself or your little sister. Gemini will stick to its guardrails so it doesn't create anything it considers inappropriate, but the same sort of shenanigans can still occur.</p><p>More importantly, you can use Nano Banana to make edits to your favorite photo. It can enhance colors, adjust lighting and tone, or even make you wear a green tuxedo, and it all looks very realistic and natural. That's why it's embedded with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-gen-ai-edit-notes-details">metadata saying it was made with AI</a>; it can fool anyone.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/googles-november-gemini-drop-adds-gemini-3-nano-banana-pro-and-more">Nano Banana Pro</a> takes things a step further. You have to be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">subscribed to Gemini Pro</a>, but you get access to the more powerful Gemini 3.0 Flash Image model. This allows your images to be translated into multiple languages, ties into Google Search so images can be context-aware, and lets you add up to 14 reference images to create the final version. All cool stuff, but you probably don't need any of it enough to pay for it.</p><p><strong>You need to try Nano Banana if you haven't</strong>. Now you know how to get started, and I promise you'll have a lot of fun even if you're not making collectibles of yourself to share on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/instagram-stories">Instagram</a>.

The service is cheekily called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/5g-home-internet/"><strong>MINTernet</strong></a>, and the plans cost as little as $30 per month when you bundle with a Mint Mobile phone plan. </p><p>That being said, Mint's whole shtick is selling 5G service in bulk, and the internet plans are no different. This means that, with the deal above, you're actually paying $90 upfront for three months of service. You can also sign up for six or 12 months of coverage with savings that increase the more you buy.</p><h2 id="mint-mobile-launches-its-very-own-5g-home-internet-service-2">Mint Mobile launches its very own 5G Home Internet service</h2><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="7a2f5d01-c57a-4506-9ea0-495456a64b8e" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="MINTernet 5G Home Internet: from $30 per month with wireless plan" data-dimension48="MINTernet 5G Home Internet: from $30 per month with wireless plan" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/5g-home-internet/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="cNfSyKCaNDAiPxukdZBSfG" name="mnt mobile square render.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cNfSyKCaNDAiPxukdZBSfG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>MINTernet 5G Home Internet: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/5g-home-internet/" data-dimension112="7a2f5d01-c57a-4506-9ea0-495456a64b8e" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="MINTernet 5G Home Internet: from $30 per month with wireless plan" data-dimension48="MINTernet 5G Home Internet: from $30 per month with wireless plan" data-dimension25=""><strong>from $30 per month with wireless plan</strong></a></p><p>Are you already a user of <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/mint-mobile-review">Mint Mobile</a>'s wireless service? Sign up for the carrier's new MINTernet 5G Home Internet service and you can enjoy whole-home coverage for as little as $30 per month ($90 upfront). If you aren't a wireless subscriber, you can also take advantage of MINTernet's introductory rate of $40 per month for three months ($120 upfront). 5G home internet isn't for everyone, but if you can get it to work for you, this is one of the cheapest options around. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/5g-home-internet/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="7a2f5d01-c57a-4506-9ea0-495456a64b8e" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="MINTernet 5G Home Internet: from $30 per month with wireless plan" data-dimension48="MINTernet 5G Home Internet: from $30 per month with wireless plan" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you need a cheap home internet solution and you don't mind paying for multiple months in advance; you're already a Mint Mobile user or willing to switch; you live in an area with great T-Mobile coverage (I'd <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/5g-home-internet/"><strong>check your address</strong></a> before you do anything else).</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you need the fastest and most reliable internet speeds possible; you'd like your internet service to provide advanced security features or entertainment perks; you prefer to pay your internet bill on a month-to-month basis.</p><p>Just like Mint's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cell-phone-plans">wireless plans</a>, MINTernet is powered by T-Mobile's vast 5G network, providing users with download speeds that typically fall in the 133-415 Mbps range, while uploads are said to have a maximum of 55 Mbps. </p><p>After signing up, customers receive a free 5G Gateway modem in the mail with a 14-day money-back guarantee. Once you have the system up and running, you'll get unlimited data within your billing cycle, although in this case unlimited means 1TB of data before "network speeds may vary". This should come as no big surprise, seeing how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/t-mobile-will-literally-pay-you-usd300-to-use-its-5g-home-internet-im-not-joking">T-Mobile's 5G Home Internet</a> service is capped at 1.2TB before speeds start to slow.</p><p>Still, the download speeds and 1TB of data offer a pretty good value for the price, and this is doubly true if you're already a user of Mint's excellent wireless service. Of course, 5G home internet is never going to be as fast or reliable as traditional fiber internet, but if you're on a tight budget (and you live in an area with good T-Mobile coverage) then Mint's new service might be exactly what you're looking for. </p><h2 id="holiday-shopping-2025-quick-links-2">Holiday shopping 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 50% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>major discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

They now use "sophisticated social engineering tactics," forcing users to open malicious websites or download harmful apps that leak their information.</p><p>One tactic that modern scammers use is impersonating a bank executive during a call and convincing users to share their screen to reveal banking information or make a bank transfer.</p><h2 id="google-adds-new-in-call-safety-checks-in-the-us-2">Google adds new in-call safety checks in the US</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="knyLgSyZLR4bMFTyGY7sic" name="google-spam-protection-usa-in-call" alt="In-call spam protection in action" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/knyLgSyZLR4bMFTyGY7sic.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That's why Google is launching a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/pixel-simplified-call-screen-protection-level">in-call protection feature</a> for financial apps.

Android will then give you the option to end the call or stop screen sharing with a single tap.</p><p>To make this even clearer, Android will place a full 30-second warning before you can continue the call.

This is especially true for latchkey kids, or those who often take care of themselves without supervision after school and while their parents are still at work.</p><p>That said, there are ways parents can alleviate some concerns they may have about their children's smartphone use. There are plenty of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-phone-kids">smartphones for kids</a> with built-in protections, and thanks to parental controls available in many smartphones through features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gives-family-link-a-new-look-and-plans-new-supervision-tools">Family Link</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/find-my-device">Find Hub</a>, parents can monitor their children's locations to ensure they're where they should be.</p><p>Additionally, parents can manage their kids' smartphone usage by restricting and approving app downloads, filtering Google Search results, setting screen time limits, and more. Furthermore, apps like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/instagrams-ai-now-detects-and-protects-teens-even-if-their-profile-says-theyre-adults">Instagram</a> have built-in age limits and content restrictions that parents concerned about social media access can use.</p><p>That said, some parents may find these safeguards insufficient and choose to hold off on giving their kids a smartphone.

The leaked rendering seems official, given the level of detail present in the imagery, though it's always worth waiting until Motorola's official say-so. Nevertheless, the post claims that the Edge 70 Ultra could retain a camera housing design similar to the Edge 70 series that launched early in November.</p><p>The company is seemingly sticking with that squared housing, as well as offering a triple camera setup with an LED flash present at the bottom right of the box.</p><p>There's one major difference to note in this leak: the Edge 70 Ultra could offer a soft, textured back. As the publication also notes, the renderings purport a material shift from the Edge 70, one that looks as if it were made from fabric. The renders show that the panel is textured, potentially improving how the device feels in the hand without a case. It'd be quite a change from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-2023-review">Moto Edge Plus (2023)</a>, which had a glass back that was extremely slippery in hand, and would likely cause the device to take a slippery spill.</p><p>The leaks don't divulge much more information; however, the device will retain its volume rocker and power button on its right side. Its display is an object of concern, as this leak doesn't show it. The Edge 70 launched with a completely flat display, which may feel more comfortable to hold than the Edge series' old curved screen. While it may feel likely that Motorola will keep the display flat, there's nothing certain yet.</p><h2 id="gearing-up-for-an-ultra-2">Gearing up for an Ultra</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1067px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="2o5rUtxscYWVkQWEXyQVGS" name="motorola-edge-70-ultra-leaked-render" alt="A leaked rendering of the alleged Moto Edge 70 Ultra with a textured, almost fabric-like back panel, a square camera housing, and three lenses." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2o5rUtxscYWVkQWEXyQVGS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1067" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Per the publication, the Edge 70 Ultra is rumored to retain a display size similar to the standard Edge 70, which is 6.6 inches; however, a small change might hit its chip. Recent rumors, after allegedly spotting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/leaked-benchmarks-detail-motorola-edge-70-ultra-snapdragon-8-gen-5">the phone in a benchmark</a>, suggest the Edge 70 Ultra could sport the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5. It's also been speculated that the phone will be paired with the Adreno 829 GPU and 16GB of RAM.</p><p>Regarding its chip,  the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/snapdragon-8-gen-5-announced">Snapdragon 8 Gen 5</a> just launched last month, bringing flagship-level performance to budget phones.

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-v50-proves-that-iterative-updates-can-still-be-fun">V50 showcased</a> a great design and fabulous cameras, and the V60 debuted in August an even bigger battery and 50MP tele lens with 3x zoom. The phone is available in India for ₹36,999 ($410) and other Southeast Asian countries, and it thankfully isn't any costlier than its predecessor.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="3kgvwXsmTCHAz4u7H5X8w6" name="Vivo V60" alt="Vivo V60 design testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3kgvwXsmTCHAz4u7H5X8w6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'm not going to do a full-fledged review of the phone as it's broadly similar to the V50, instead focusing on two areas where it stands out: design and cameras.

I still don't get why mid-range phones get the best designs; I would have loved to see something like this on my X300 Pro or the standard X300. Instead, those phones have a much more muted design, and this isn't anything new — flagships in general don't have bold styling any longer.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="8KFBqmDDReem4eSZ68dZ87" name="Vivo V60" alt="Vivo V60 design testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8KFBqmDDReem4eSZ68dZ87.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If I had to guess, it's because brands are wary of introducing outlandish designs on their costliest phones. Considering they don't sell in anywhere as much volumes as the mid-rangers, it's devices like the V60 that get all the design attention. Don't get me wrong; it isn't like there's anything wrong with the X300 or X300 Pro; in fact, they're better at usability thanks to the matte texture and metal mid-frames, with the V60 touting a glossy finish and polycarbonate sides.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="X2Mgqm4mK9rgBWuVKL3dy6" name="Vivo V60" alt="Vivo V60 design testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/X2Mgqm4mK9rgBWuVKL3dy6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Other than the design, the phone gets IP68 and IP69 ingress protection, and it handles weather conditions just as well as the X300. Vivo retained the same 6.77-inch panel, and it gets just as bright, with similar color vibrancy as its predecessor. The Snapdragon 7 Gen 4 ensures it is a little faster at gaming, but it isn't that noticeable unless you have the V50 next to it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="egdzW4do8ZXasYbNbpD9u6" name="Vivo V60" alt="Vivo V60 design testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/egdzW4do8ZXasYbNbpD9u6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What's annoying in this regard is that Vivo continues to use UFS 2.2 storage modules; I don't see why the brand doesn't move to UFS 3.0 or UFS 4.0 in this category, but it likely has something to do with bringing down the cost to under $450. On that note, the optical fingerprint module is good enough, but it isn't as fast or good to use as the ultrasonic sensors on Vivo's latest phones.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="bryZotdkjZdh9NyBwbgoq6" name="Vivo V60" alt="Vivo V60 design testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bryZotdkjZdh9NyBwbgoq6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There isn't much to talk about on the connectivity side of things, with the V60 unchanged from its predecessor. The bigger battery means I was able to get a day and a half before needing to charge the device, and even with heavy use, there are no issues getting it to last a day.</p><p>Charging tech is identical to last year, with Vivo's 90W standard now a known quantity. It takes just over 45 minutes to charge the battery, and Vivo thankfully bundles a charger with the device; then again, the phone is limited to Asian markets.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5119px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="HFPBT5h2PEEjnStqo7BB77" name="Vivo V60" alt="Vivo V60 design testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HFPBT5h2PEEjnStqo7BB77.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5119" height="2883" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Cameras are even better this time around, with the V60 featuring a 50MP main camera with 50MP tele lens that does 3x optical zoom, with both lenses coming with OIS. There's an 8MP wide-angle lens, but that's average. The V60 has Vivo's standard Zeiss modes, and camera tuning is fantastic — it is definitely better than most other mid-range phones.</p><p>The main camera takes standout photos in just about any scenario, and the versatility of the 3x lens is great to see on a mid-range phone. It does just as well when shooting portraits, and if anything, this is what I like the most about the module. Other than the wide-angle lens not quite holding its own, I have no problems with the cameras on the V60. If you intend to take a lot of photos, this is the phone to get.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4620px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="2pKXfbRrz6aLKNoxDzqEg6" name="Vivo V60" alt="Vivo V60 design testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2pKXfbRrz6aLKNoxDzqEg6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4620" height="2602" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'm still not quite sure that Vivo needs to launch two V series phones a year, but at least we're just getting one variant — there's no mention of the V60 Pro, and that's a good thing.

However, the phone <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-delayed-us-availability">skipped its U.S. launch</a>. The company confirmed that the delay was due to the phone not receiving FCC approval before launch because of the government shutdown that lasted from October 1, 2025, to November 12, 2025.</p><p>Thankfully, we learned last week that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-fcc-clearance">FCC clearance had come through</a> and OnePlus would officially launch the phone in the U.S. soon. The company has now announced that the OnePlus 15 will be available for pre-orders starting <strong>December 4, 2025</strong> (Thursday) on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oneplus.com/us/oneplus-15">OnePlus' official website</a>.</p><p>The company hasn't announced the exact shipping date or open-sale date yet, but it should happen sometime next week if things follow the usual pattern. Still, for anyone planning to buy the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-vs-oneplus-12">OnePlus 15</a> in the U.S., the company is offering some generous freebies with pre-orders.</p><p>In the U.S., if you pre-order a OnePlus 15, you'll be able to choose one of the following four add-ons for free:</p><ul><li>43 mm OnePlus Watch 3 (worth $300) — available only with the $999 512 GB / 16 GB RAM model</li><li>OnePlus Buds Pro 3 (worth $180)</li><li>OnePlus AirVOOC 50W Magnetic Charger (worth $80)</li><li>OnePlus 15 magnetic case</li></ul><p>OnePlus notes that these freebies come in limited stock and are first-come, first-served. Of course, if you want the best-value <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/the-oneplus-watch-3-arrives-with-wearos-5-and-extended-battery-life">OnePlus Watch 3</a>, you might have to act fast since that freebie will likely sell out first.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5078px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="gVN3dQhzBBwE6peKoMv28N" name="OnePlus 15" alt="OnePlus 15 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gVN3dQhzBBwE6peKoMv28N.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5078" height="2860" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In addition, OnePlus is also offering trade-in deals on the OnePlus 15. You can trade in any smartphone in any condition and get $100 credit. The company will also offer a $100 cashback bonus when you purchase with a trade-in.</p><p>These are some of the strongest discounts you'll see on the OnePlus 15, and with the holiday season coming up, it might be the perfect time to upgrade.</p><p>For those wondering about the base variant, the OnePlus 15 will retail for $900 when pre-orders go live. Alongside that, you'll be able to grab the free earbuds, AirVOOC charger, or magnetic case.</p> ]]></dc:content>

While the newest edition isn't launching until December 9 at 1 PM GMT (8 AM EST), the company's press release states the phone is the culmination of several aspects. Together with Nothing, these four people worked on its hardware and accessory design, as well as its lock screen clock and wallpaper.</p><p>What's more, everyone had a hand in the phone's marketing campaign, which we're now seeing come to light.</p><p>Nothing is highlighting its lessons learned from its first collaborative Community Edition by stating it's revamped its development timeline by "extending the co-creation window." This year, everyone reportedly worked together for nine months. Even the aspects of the phone's design were expanded, so everyone could get more involved with the Community Edition from top to bottom.</p><p>The winning creators were gifted a £1,000 cash prize, as well, for their involvement during the submission process and beyond. Nothing states that this year's Community Edition embodies its "ambitious and bold" mindset for product design.</p><h2 id="made-with-the-community-2">Made with the community</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SFeKJ5VyrszQNLjDdupV7a" name="Nothing-Phone-3a-2" alt="Photos of the Nothing Phone 3a series." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SFeKJ5VyrszQNLjDdupV7a.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Nothing mentioned its lessons learned from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-unveils-the-phone-2a-plus-with-a-glow-up-back-that-shines-in-the-dark">its first Community Edition</a>, which was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-plus-is-here-and-its-got-a-chip-no-one-else-has">Phone 2a Plus</a> that launched in 2024. Similar to what we're getting soon, Nothing created that device with "input from the fans." The device also featured similar internals to what consumers received during the Phone 2a Plus' original launch that same year.</p><p>What resulted after the long creation process was a 2a Plus that glowed in the dark. It's important to note that, during its first Community Edition, Nothing only made 1,000 units. It was a limited-time run that surely gripped those involved and others who enjoyed that glowing aesthetic. It remains to be seen if Nothing will do something similar with its Phone 3a Community Edition.</p><p>In other news, Nothing's been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-os-4-arrives-for-the-phone-3-with-exclusive-features-refined-glyph-interface-and-more">rolling out its OS 4.0 update</a> to its recent phones. The company's flagship Phone 3 received the patch first, late in November. It came with some exclusive features, too, like Glyph Toys, Glyph Mirror Selfie, Flip to Glyph controls, and more. Most recently, and in good timing, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-phone-3a-just-got-android-16-proving-budget-phones-dont-have-to-wait">Phone 3a started receiving</a> its major Android 16 upgrade.</p><p>The Phone 3a sits on the budget side of the line, but Nothing's not treating it as such. The company is quickly rolling out its promised Nothing OS 4 update after its flagship received it officially. System animations, battery optimization, and much more are involved in this update, making the Phone 3a much better in all areas.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Over 3/4 of logged runs last less than an hour, with only a tiny percentage hitting two hours. Even marathoners mix long runs with jogs and short sprints, while most other athletes are running in shorter bursts.</p><p>Likewise, nearly half of all logged walks are between 0–30 minutes; clearly, Garmin users are logging every mile they can from dog-walking or lunch jaunts. But overall, 55 minutes is the average length for an activity; other, longer sports like hiking and cycling skew up the average.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1881px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NJUFJGCvpBPSbG97oMNQsd" name="garmin-2025-report-average-steps" alt="A Garmin Connect 2025 report graph showing how many steps users take on average." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NJUFJGCvpBPSbG97oMNQsd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1881" height="1058" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It was also fascinating to see the bell-curved graph of users' average daily steps, with 8,000 steps as the middle point. According to Garmin, Hong Kong-based users average the most steps per day (10,663), followed by South Korea, Spain, China, and Ireland.</p><p>For competitive Garmin users, you can compare your average steps against this graph and see how you stack up, and whether you want to raise your average in 2026 as a New Year's resolution.</p><p>Likewise, Garmin goads us with this report into trying to earn some of its toughest badges. For example, only 0.7% of users have earned the Everest expedition badge for climbing 29,029 feet, while 1.5% have earned the Appalachian Trail badge for hiking 2,200 miles.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="y86ooPBBrMiDEMFfhsTbTh" name="Garmin-Forerunner-970-steps-widget" alt="The Garmin Forerunner 970 worn on a wrist showing a step count widget for the past week, highlighting 18,391 steps tracked on Thursday." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y86ooPBBrMiDEMFfhsTbTh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The full report breaks down more information on the average times that people start working out and which generations prefer which workouts. For instance, 60–69-year-olds led other age groups for outdoor cycling, walking, and hiking, while people my age do much more treadmill running and strength training than I do.</p><p>It's also fascinating to see demographic differences in users' stats. Dutch Garmin owners are the least stressed of any country, Portuguese users get the most recharge from sleep, Chinese users burn the most energy per day, Slovenians hike more than anyone else, and so on.</p><p>While anyone can check their own averages in the Connect app and see how they compare, Garmin says that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-connect-plus-in-depth-hands-on-much-more-than-an-ai-unfortunately">Connect Plus</a> users will receive a personalized "Rundown," or highlight reel, starting today with their own total steps, average sleep score, activity stats, and more.</p> ]]></dc:content>

I tested the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sonodyne-malhar-review">Malhar Bluetooth speaker</a> last year, and was immediately blown away by the sound quality. In fact, it was so good that I switched out the Marshall Stanmore I've been using for the better part of a decade, and the Malhar is now the default Bluetooth speaker in my home office.</p><p>So when Sonodyne said it was making a soundbar, I was obviously interested. The Sama 5000 made its debut in August 2025, and it is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.in/Sonodyne-SAMA-5000-Immersive-Pass-Through/dp/B0F2TCYGVF">now available in India for ₹24,349</a> ($270). While it is targeted at the mid-range category, it doesn't miss out on the basics: you get powerful sound, Dolby Atmos tuning, a dedicated sub, and HDMI eARC.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="Xe4AMXzFEJHnSvXkRgwuR5" name="Sonodyne Sama 5000" alt="Sonodyne Sama 5000 soundbar review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Xe4AMXzFEJHnSvXkRgwuR5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I use Bose's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bose-smart-ultra-dolby-atmos-soundbar-ideal-rocking-out">Smart Ultra Soundbar</a> along with the Bass Module 700, and while the Sama 5000 doesn't quite sound as good, it isn't meant to — this soundbar is much more accessible, and the sound reflects that. Let's start with the design; the Sama 5000 doesn't differ too much from traditional soundbar design, so you get a standard black chassis with a front-facing grille. The soundbar has the requisite bracket to mount it on a wall.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="4ES45saJkpgen5UmFCsVD5" name="Sonodyne Sama 5000" alt="Sonodyne Sama 5000 soundbar review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4ES45saJkpgen5UmFCsVD5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>After using the soundbar for just over three months, I can confirm that the matte texture doesn't pick up much dust. The design blends in, and the soundbar doesn't draw much attention to itself. I like that the subwoofer pairs wirelessly, but the enclosure itself is as plain as it gets, and it doesn't have any design flair — not that you need it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="aqUGAxqEEAZRJX3iEm2Wn4" name="Sonodyne Sama 5000" alt="Sonodyne Sama 5000 soundbar review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aqUGAxqEEAZRJX3iEm2Wn4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are three distinct driver units at the front, with a center and left/right channels. You get all the requisite connectivity; the Sama 5000 gets HDMI in, USB, 3.5mm in, optical, and HDMI eARC out. Thankfully, the soundbar connects to the subwoofer without any hassle, and it is as easy as it gets — just hit the pair button, and both units connect.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="QEjZpZxucJ5MkVpr2kGcx4" name="Sonodyne Sama 5000" alt="Sonodyne Sama 5000 soundbar review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QEjZpZxucJ5MkVpr2kGcx4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The bundled remote is pretty good too; it doesn't have backlit buttons, but you get the usual playback controls. It's particularly handy when connecting the soundbar with a phone; the Sama 5000 gets Bluetooth 5.4, and it's easy to pair with an Android phone — I used it with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/i-took-the-find-x9-pro-to-mexico-its-cameras-are-on-another-level-entirely">Find X9 Pro </a>among other devices.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="WMdb5Fp2DdccQh9QP6g7h4" name="Sonodyne Sama 5000" alt="Sonodyne Sama 5000 soundbar review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WMdb5Fp2DdccQh9QP6g7h4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Obviously, there are dozens of soundbars these days, and where the Sama 5000 stands out is the DSP tuning. It's clear that Sonodyne paid particular attention in this area, and it leads to the soundbar delivering a mellifluous sound with clear rendition of dialogue, good instrument separation, and an engaging sound that's much better than what you'd normally see in this category.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="y4peaWV5bfUQfN8vvxwUk4" name="Sonodyne Sama 5000" alt="Sonodyne Sama 5000 soundbar review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y4peaWV5bfUQfN8vvxwUk4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The 6.5-inch subwoofer has good bass extension, and it adds dynamism to the mix. There are three sound modes — music, movies, and voice — and it was in the movies mode where the soundbar comes into its own. You get a good soundstage and level of immersion that's pretty great when you consider the size of the soundbar. It lends itself well to movies and TV shows, and you can immediately see the difference in the sound even against other soundbars in this category.</p><p>While it doesn't have dedicated height channels, Sonodyne did a good job with the audio tuning, so you get some directionality to the sound that's plenty great in its own right.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="zJwAU9fViwMuPZbEnQzsG5" name="Sonodyne Sama 5000" alt="Sonodyne Sama 5000 soundbar review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zJwAU9fViwMuPZbEnQzsG5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On the whole, I enjoyed using the Sama 5000. It's safe to say that this is one of the best-sounding products in this category, and the clean design with hassle-free connectivity and ease of use make it a clear standout. Sonodyne is proving that it can deliver modern audio solutions, and if you're looking to upgrade the sound of your TV and want a soundbar that stands out, the Sama 5000 is my go-to recommendation in this category.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="1691a537-c6b8-45db-a9f6-284c224adfd7">            <a href="https://www.amazon.in/Sonodyne-SAMA-5000-Immersive-Pass-Through/dp/B0F2TCYGVF" data-model-name="Sama 5000 Soundbar" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yyCPijqDE2gNoM5crvvmKj.jpg' alt="Sonodyne Sama 5000"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class='featured__brand'>Sonodyne</div>                                        <div class="featured__title">Sama 5000 Soundbar</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>There are dozens of soundbars in India, but if you want a Dolby Atmos-enabled model with standout sound, you should get the Sama 5000.

Now, Garmin is launching the InReach Mini 3 Plus, an SOS satellite handheld communicator that may be a more practical option for serious backpackers who spend time in cellular dead zones.</p><p>Unlike past InReach models like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-inreach-messenger-plus-announced">Messenger Plus</a> or Mini 2, the InReach Mini 3 Plus has a touch display that spreads across most of its body, in addition to the usual nav buttons. This will make menuing and sending messages on the device significantly easier, where before you had to tap through letters one at a time.</p><p>The Mini 3 Plus packs in a mic and speaker, letting you send short voice messages or record voice memos via the device, then hear your loved ones' replies, all over satellite. It can also send photos, though you'll need your phone to capture and upload them to the Messenger app.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BNtnCbqYJII" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>The Fenix 8 Pro, by contrast, can only send text messages, check-ins, and SOS alerts — no photos or voice memos. And while the InReach Messenger Plus can send voice memos, too, you have to use your phone, while the Mini 3 Plus works even if your phone battery dies.</p><p>Garmin uses the mic & speaker to enable voice commands, too, letting you trigger certain features like check-ins or turning on LiveTrack without needing to use the touchscreen. We're curious to see how well this feature works, as voice commands can be hit-or-miss on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watches</a>.</p><p>Like most InReach devices and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-gpsmap-67i-review">GPSMAP handhelds</a>, the InReach Mini 3 Plus has an SOS button that sends an emergency message and your GPS location to a 24/7 Garmin Response team. What's new is access to the touchscreen to make replies to responders easier, as well as multi-band GPS frequency for more accurate location data.</p><p>It's also the first InReach device we know of to have an MIL-STD-810 rating for thermal, shock, and water damage, with an IP67 rating instead of IPX7 for the Messenger Plus and Mini 2. This should help it survive falls, though the display only has "chemically strengthened glass."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hvCQS7Z7LHNXHrEKbLTZuB" name="Garmin-InReach-Mini-3-SOS-and-courses" alt="A YouTube screenshot of two InReach Mini 3s sitting on rocks, one showing an SOS alert, one showing course turn-by-turn navigation." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hvCQS7Z7LHNXHrEKbLTZuB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Outside of emergencies, you can have the Mini 3 Plus send LiveTrack location data to trusted contacts. Garmin says it'll last for 350 hours (about 14 days) with ten-minute check-in intervals, or 95 hours in "performance" mode with more frequent messages.</p><p>In terms of what the Mini 3 Plus can do <em>besides</em> satellite messaging, you can sync it with the Garmin Explore app, where you'll create GPX courses for you to follow with turn-by-turn navigation. You can also check weather forecasts or satellite imagery using the app.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/1756582/pn/010-03387-10/">Garmin InReach Mini 3 Plus</a> starts at $499.99, or $449 for a version without photo and voice messaging.

Make sure to <a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=androidcentral.com" target="_blank"><strong>set Android Central as a preferred source</strong></a> in Google Search, and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should"><strong>find out why you should</strong></a> so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>Google announced in 2024 that reminders in Google Keep would soon use Google Tasks, unifying the experience across Workspace. In October, it announced the rollout would begin for all Workspace users, including both paid subscribers and personal Google accounts. Now, the transition is officially starting to begin for Android users, as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/11/28/google-keep-tasks-rollout/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>.</p><p>When available for your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/everything-you-need-know-about-google-workspace-spaces-and-smart-canvas">Google Workspace</a> account, you'll see a pop-up bubble explaining the transition the first time you try to create a reminder in Google Keep. "New! Reminders are now Google Tasks," the message explains. "View, edit, and complete your reminders from Keep, Calendar, Tasks, Assistant, and Gemini."</p><p>Google Keep's legacy reminders are effectively no more, as they are now Google Tasks that appear throughout the Workspace ecosystem. As such, the <strong>Home</strong>, <strong>Work</strong>, and <strong>Pick a place</strong> options are being phased out, since Tasks doesn't support location-based reminders. For older Keep reminders with location data, this information will be added to the Task's description. Notably, there's a limit of 100,000 tasks, so if you have more Keep reminders only the newest ones will be added to Tasks.</p><p>Once your Workspace account receives access to the rollout, your Keep reminders will appear in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-tasks-rolls-out-its-long-overdue-deadline-feature-but-its-still-half-baked">Google Tasks app</a>, as the following screenshots from 9to5Google show:</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:72.25%;"><img id="Mw4Nr554L7mYBf6VLJ43Jg" name="Google-Tasks-Reminders-Keep-9to5Google" alt="The Google Keep reminders appearing in Google Tasks." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Mw4Nr554L7mYBf6VLJ43Jg.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="1156" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google says that any date- or time-based Keep reminders will automatically be imported to Tasks, and that goes for new and existing reminders. Any app with access to Tasks data can complete a task — this list includes Keep, Gmail, Calendar, Chat, Docs, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>. The idea is that the experience of creating to-do lists and reminders will be more consistent across Android and Google Workspace.</p><p>As part of the change, Google Keep itself cannot send notifications for reminders. You'll need to download the Google Calendar and/or Google Tasks apps to get notification reminders for Tasks (formerly reminders) created with Keep. There are a few other quirks, like how the title of a reminder must be changed in Calendar or Tasks to show up correctly in notifications.</p><p>In other words, reminders in Keep as we knew them are going away, but integration with Tasks will unify the experience of creating to-do lists in the Google ecosystem.</p><p>Here are a few more limitations of Google Tasks replacing Keep reminders, according to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/tasks/answer/16540694" target="_blank">support document</a>:</p><ul><li><strong>Long reminders:</strong> If your Keep reminder is too long, its title is shortened after it migrates to Tasks.</li><li><strong>Pending tasks:</strong> You can find a list of all "Pending tasks" from the last 365 days in the "All-day" section of your calendar for the current day.</li><li><strong>Repeating tasks:</strong> If you have a task that repeats more than every 1,000 days, weeks, months, or years, we adjust the recurrence schedule to be once every 1,000 days, weeks, months, or years. For example, a task that repeats every 2,000 days is adjusted to every 1,000 days.<ul><li>Reminders that don’t repeat and are older than a year are added to an "Old Google Keep Reminders" list.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Tasks beyond the year 3000:</strong> Any tasks with dates beyond the year 3000 are adjusted to the year 2900.</li></ul><p>The updated Keep experience with Tasks integration is rolling out now, and it should complete by the end of the year. Note that for paid enterprise users, this functionality may not be available if your work admins have disabled either Tasks or Keep.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/android/new-android-features-December-2025/">company just announced</a> that it will introduce new features to help users really focus on the things and people that matter most to them when they pick up their phones — cutting out the unnecessary noise. " See the emotion behind speech in captions, send new emoji combos, and let friends know when your call is important," the Keyword added.</p><p>To start, users will now be able to see and read the emotion behind each video they come across, whether it's a friend's video note or when scrolling through social media — with "Expressive Captions." The feature creates real-time captions, describing the intensity at which a person is speaking, along with ambient noises like [birds chirping], [cheers and applause], etc.</p><p>Google says Android will also pick up on the emotion of the speaker, like [joyful] or [sad], and will be shown in those square brackets right before the captions begin. Neat right? This is especially helpful when you have the volume turned down on your phone, while at work or during the night, and you still get a sense of the video you're watching.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="jYtjK7raHAsfAFiraoqskL" name="1.

Google says,  <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-gboard-emoji-mashups-and-how-create-your-own">"Emoji Kitchen sticker combos"</a> —will let you mash up two emojis to create your own unique sticker, like when you sign off for the year (⛄️ + ✒️) or send holiday well-wishes (🫂 + ⛄️). "Mix and match your favorites, and share them with friends in Gboard for more ways to express yourself," the press release notes.</p><p>Furthermore, users will be able to let friends and family know when their calls are urgent with "Call reason", so that you don't get hung up on. Especially handy, since most people prefer texting or are busy. Google says that this feature is still in beta, but will roll out soon. Users can flag a contact as “urgent," and it pops on on their incoming call screen. If they miss it, the “urgent” note stays in their call history, prompting them to get back to you quickly.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="7RawqNaDHxRYujFjkVspNn" name="Android-Dec-updates" alt="Google just dropped a host of features for Android users" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7RawqNaDHxRYujFjkVspNn.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="google-messages-gets-an-added-layer-of-privacy-2">Google messages gets an added layer of privacy</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="7Cvu6UScwH8JCwQGGWszqn" name="Android-Dec-updates" alt="Google just dropped a host of features for Android users" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7Cvu6UScwH8JCwQGGWszqn.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This one is for those times when you get added to sketchy group chats, and they spam you with a million texts.

Guided Frame, available in the Camera app on Pixels, is picking up a boost from Gemini. The press release states that the AI model enhances the "descriptive understanding" of what's displayed in the viewfinder. Google states Gemini takes things from basic explanations, like saying there's a face in frame to who it is, what they're wearing, the color of their attire, and more.</p><p>Getting hearing aids paired with your Android phone is now supported by Fast Pair. This update brings single-tap connections, as users who need hearing aids can easily pair their Bluetooth LE Audio-enabled devices to their compatible Android phone. Google states this is rolling out for Demant hearing aids first, but users can expect an expansion to Starkey devices in "early" 2026.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="jyCLSLaHreiENcRQacb62f" name="google-android-december-2025-guided-frame" alt="Google's accessibility update for Android gives Guided Frame the Gemini treatment, which makes its explanations more descriptive." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jyCLSLaHreiENcRQacb62f.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="TTCPmLsEYaa4Tv2VdfuFwe" name="google-android-december-2025-hearing-aids-fast-pair" alt="Android's accessibility update brings Fast Pair's single-tap connection to hearing aids." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TTCPmLsEYaa4Tv2VdfuFwe.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Everyone likes watching videos, and Google's taking that enjoyment and making it better with an Expressive Captions update.</p><p>This patch, rolling out in December, makes Expressive Captions comprehend and deliver the emotional tone and speech of what the user is watching. Google says its Expressive Captions will soon express the "intent" behind what the person speaking in the video is trying to convey. So, if they seem sad or joyful, users will see [joy] in the caption.</p><p>These new captions are making their way into YouTube videos across all devices, too. Google states this will affect all videos uploaded to YouTube after October.</p><p>This month's Android update brings a few more updates, just to make navigation a little cleaner.</p><p>Google is making a change to how users activate Voice Access on Android. Arriving soon, after users enable Voice Access once via their Settings, they need only lean on Gemini to produce it from thereafter. Using the wake-up command, "Hey Google, start Voice Access," will get the ball rolling without interacting with your phone manually.</p><p>Voice Access is capable of more now, as it picks up accents better, understands speech patterns, and punctuation, too. The feature is also becoming available in Japanese.</p><h2 id="seeing-your-screen-managing-what-s-on-it-2">Seeing your screen, managing what's on it</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="5Pjhirm4QrridDjKmC22ze" name="google-android-december-2025-autoclick" alt="The accessibility update for Android in December 2025 improves AutoClick, giving users more agency over the actions of the clicks for external mice." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5Pjhirm4QrridDjKmC22ze.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Dark Mode is convenient, but user feedback following its Android 16 changes showed how jarring it was when hopping into a flashbang (light mode). Google states its updates rolling out in December will offer a systemwide Dark Mode change that automatically darkens apps "even without their own native dark theme."</p><p>Wrapping up the updates is AutoClick, a feature that helps those who may experience pain or difficulty with physically clicking their mouse. Leveraging an external mouse on your Android device gets a little easier with this patch, as users can "set a custom amount of time for the cursor to pause on something before it automatically performs a click for you." Additional customization arrives, as well, which lets users personalize what the clicking action should do, like whether it's a left-click, right-click, scroll, drag, and more.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Vats states that One UI 8.5 has shown signs of a new setting called "Block apps with excessive ads" in its Device Care section. In its default state, the feature offers "basic blocking," which means "Apps identified by Samsung as sending frequent ads will be blocked whenever they're detected on your phone."</p><p>This blocking mechanism seemingly involves your Galaxy device putting the app in question into deep sleep, stopping all shenanigans.</p><p>Vats came across a secondary option, which, for right now, is shown as toggleable called "Intelligent blocking." If enabled, it seems your Galaxy device would leverage its software to "analyze" a user's notification to determine if it's an ad and block it if the alert becomes far too frequent. There's a chance that this could lean on Galaxy AI for understanding the context of an ad, as the footnote states, "this determination may not be accurate."</p><p>There's hope for this feature, though it seems more testing is required to know its extent, as Vats discussed in the comments. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/tarunvats33/status/1995459361427132886?s=20">code discovery suggests</a> this ad-spam protection will be available on all Galaxy devices, not just its phones. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/tarunvats33/status/1995459183018123573?s=20">testing is required</a> to see if this feature works "systemwide."</p><h2 id="keeping-things-clean-2">Keeping things clean</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">One UI 8.5: Device care has added a new feature, 'Block apps with excessive ads.' pic.twitter.com/BS1PNrG6a1<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1995423778705399935">December 1, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>There's a lot of hype going on with One UI 8.5, as Samsung's been internally testing the new software for a few months now. More importantly, a recent discovery claims the company could bring "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-one-ui-8-5-code-hints-super-fast-wireless-charging">Super Fast Wireless Charging</a>" to the Galaxy S26 through One UI 8.5. The S26 Ultra could sport 25W wireless charging capabilities, leaving the other two (S26, S26 Plus) with 20W. There's speculation that this boost for the Ultra could quicken its pace by ~40%, but that's just an estimate for now.</p><p>Moreover, shortly after, there was an alleged wallpaper leak for the S26 series. There are rumors that the series could launch in Mint, Coral, Black, Violet, Silver, and Grey.</p><p>We've also gone from hearing about a potential Beta Program to seeing it reportedly delayed, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-may-look-to-gift-galaxy-users-a-one-ui-8-5-beta-in-december">now those whispers are back</a> and say it could begin in December. Reports from X suggest Samsung could be eyeing a One UI 8.5 beta early in December as part of a Phase 1 plan. If true, the beta would begin on December 8 for the U.S., U.K., and Germany, before rolling into Phase 2 on December 22 for users in India and Poland.</p><p>A third phase is purported to start early in January, as Samsung tries to finish things up for its supposed Galaxy S26 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-may-have-locked-in-the-galaxy-s26-launch-date">launch in February</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

In fact, Google quickly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/high-demand-leads-google-to-cap-gemini-3-pro-and-nano-banana-pro-usage">changed the rate limits for Gemini 3 Pro and Nano Banana Pro</a> for free users following a surge of user demand. Just a few days later, Google is expanding Gemini 3 and Nano Banana Pro availability, but only for paid subscribers in AI Mode in Google Search.</p><p>As of Dec. 1, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini 3</a> is available in Google AI Mode in nearly 120 countries and territories in English, according to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/search/gemini-3-ai-mode-more-countries/" target="_blank">blog post</a>. However, this expanded availability is only for Google AI Pro or Google AI Ultra subscribers. Users can start trying out Gemini 3 Pro by tapping the opening the model picker in AI Mode and selecting <strong>Thinking with 3 Pro</strong>. This will replace the Gemini 2.5-series models used in AI Mode normally.</p><p>"Thanks to Gemini 3’s state-of-the-art reasoning capabilities, AI Mode can grasp the nuance of your most complex queries," Google explains. "And Gemini 3’s unparalleled multimodal understanding and powerful agentic coding capabilities are unlocking new generative user interfaces — so you can get dynamic visual layouts, interactive tools and custom simulations — all generated on the fly, specifically for your query."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="z95hZTTCTHVhVjXWaiLikL" name="Generative-UI-Google-Search" alt="AI-generated visuals in AI Mode in Search." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/z95hZTTCTHVhVjXWaiLikL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google is also opening up Nano Banana Pro availability in AI Mode today, expanding the list of supported countries to include the following: Argentina, Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, India, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, Pakistan, Peru, South Africa, South Korea, United States, and Venezuela.</p><p>Like with the Gemini 3 expansion, this wider availability begins with Google AI Pro and Google AI Ultra subscribers. AI Pro costs $20 per month, while AI Ultra is priced highly at $250 per month. Google says that Nano Banana Pro "uses Gemini’s advanced reasoning and connects to Search's vast knowledge base to help you visualize infographics and more."</p><p>With Gemini 3, AI Mode can better deploy the query fan-out strategy to complete more searches simultaneously, finding new suggestions based on the goal of your search. Additionally, it uses Google's new generative UI feature to make images, tables, and grids that are interactive and unique to your search.</p><p>This week's announcement confirms that Google is steadily expanding Gemini 3 availability over time, as it previewed alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-3-pro-googles-new-ai-model-aims-to-redefine-multimodal-understanding">original Gemini 3 release</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

While flagship owners flaunt the latest software, the mid-range crowd often sits in the waiting room for months. Nothing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/phone-2a-plus-nothing-os-3-dot-0-rollout">broke that cycle with the Phone 2a Plus</a>, and it continues it with its latest budget models.</p><p>Just days after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-os-4-arrives-for-the-phone-3-with-exclusive-features-refined-glyph-interface-and-more">upgrading its flagship Phone 3</a>, the company is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nothing.community/d/48033-nothing-phone-3a-series-nothing-os-b40-251118-1551-changelog" target="_blank">pushing</a> the stable Android 16-based Nothing OS 4.0 update to the Nothing Phone 3a and 3a Pro.</p><p>For those tracking the version numbers, this is build B4.0-251118-1551. It jumps these devices straight to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a>, layering Nothing’s signature monochrome aesthetic on top of Google's latest OS improvements.</p><p>The first thing you’ll notice is the new look. There are redesigned app icons and two new lock-screen clock faces inspired by old dot-matrix displays. The standout feature, though, is the new Extra Dark Mode. If your phone has ever felt too bright at night, this mode makes the screen even darker and could help your OLED panel last a bit longer.</p><p>Customization is also improved. The Quick Settings panel now lets you add more 2x2 tiles, and the Weather, Pedometer, and Screen Time widgets are available in more sizes.</p><h2 id="privacy-you-can-see-2">Privacy you can see</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="objApTBuN3vo47FqWGC2Ra" name="Nothing-Phone-3a-1" alt="Photos of the Nothing Phone 3a series." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/objApTBuN3vo47FqWGC2Ra.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Nothing is focusing more on transparency with a new AI Usage Dashboard in Essential Space. Rather than making general claims about privacy, this tool clearly tracks large language model (LLM) activity. It shows you which AI features are running and when, offering a level of detail that most smartphones don’t provide.</p><p>The camera update combines technical improvements with creative features. It launches faster and has a new interface, but the highlight is the new "Stretch" filter. Made with fashion photographer Jordan Hemingway, this preset gives your photos a unique, cinematic look.</p><p>For video, Motion Photos now let you record longer clips with audio. The new "Flip to Record" feature also lets you take photos without stopping your video.</p><p>Multitasking is easier now. The updated pop-up view can handle two floating icons at once, so you can drag and drop or switch between tasks more smoothly. You can also hide apps right from the app drawer or home screen.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="44Q6Ti8dwBfQVCVcDxdwQC" name="Nothing Phone 3a Pro" alt="Nothing Phone 3a Pro with LED lights enabled" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/44Q6Ti8dwBfQVCVcDxdwQC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Glyph Interface is also improving.

However, shortly after announcing the design update in May 2025 and then rolling it out in July, Google pulled the update and users were left with the same QR scanner they've had for years. Now, a new report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/12/01/android-qr-code-scanner-redesign-returns/">9to5Google</a> claims the redesign is rolling out once again.</p><p>According to the report, the new design is being pushed with the Google Play Services update 25.46.32. The report states that the redesign has already appeared on "several Android devices today," although I personally haven't received it on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-vs-pixel-9-pro">Google Pixel 10 Pro</a>, even after updating Play Services to the latest version.</p><h2 id="google-revives-the-new-qr-scanner-ui-rollout-2">Google revives the new QR scanner UI rollout</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ma7TgFnGaZtPKAj3Pnr2WB" name="google-new-qr-scanner-android" alt="Android's new QR scanner UI" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ma7TgFnGaZtPKAj3Pnr2WB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That said, the new design is the same one Google briefly rolled out earlier this year. For those unaware, the updated UI moves the flash toggle, system file picker, and feedback button into a pill-shaped bar below the scanning area for better one-handed use.</p><p>Once your Android phone <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-read-qr-code-your-android-phones-camera">scans a QR code</a>, an overlay appears showing the QR data, such as the associated URL or numbers, along with quick actions like opening the link, sharing it, or copying the text. The overlay also seems to follow the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-unveils-the-most-massive-android-redesign-ever">Material 3 Expressive design</a> language, as other apps that Google has been updating recently.</p><p>The redesign is reportedly rolling out now, though I haven't seen it on my device yet. You can check whether you have the new UI by opening the QR scanner from Quick Settings or the lockscreen shortcut. If not, you can try updating Google Play Services through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.gms&hl=en">this link</a> and then check the QR scanner again.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/its-official-samsungs-galaxy-z-trifold-launch">officially unveiled the device</a> on December 1, 2025, and even though it won't launch in the U.S. until early 2026, a new video has shown what to expect when it finally goes on sale.</p><p>Popular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMiJRAwDNSNzuYeN2uWa0pA">YouTuber Mrwhosetheboss</a> went hands-on with the Galaxy Z TriFold shortly after Samsung revealed it. The video covers everything, including the unboxing, design and build, software experience, internal hardware, and what it's actually like to use the phone.</p><h2 id="a-closer-look-at-samsung-s-new-galaxy-z-trifold-2">A closer look at Samsung's new Galaxy Z TriFold</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qNKKSujit94" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>The video starts with a quick unboxing of the trifolding phone. Arun (Mrwhosetheboss) notes that while most modern Samsung phones ship in small boxes, the Galaxy Z TriFold arrives in a much larger box. It's similar to what Samsung did with the first Galaxy Z Fold, using a big box to deliver a more premium first impression.</p><p>Inside the box, you get the Galaxy Z TriFold laid out fully unfolded, a SIM ejector, a USB-C cable, and a slim case made to cover the device's spine for protection when closed. A rare addition is a 45 W charger included in the box, something missing from devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>. Given the price, though, this inclusion is expected.</p><p>In terms of first impressions, when folded, the cover screen looks similar to the 6.5-inch outer display of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> with comparable bezels. However, the video notes that the device is quite heavy at 309 g, making it much heavier than the Z Fold 7.</p><p>When fully unfolded, the Galaxy Z TriFold becomes an extremely slim device measuring just 3.9 mm at its thinnest point. Since it uses a U-shaped tri-fold design, both sides fold inward individually toward the center, and the video even shows an animation that appears if you fold it incorrectly.</p><p>Once unfolded, the device offers a big 10.1-inch 16:11 display similar to an Android tablet. Arun notes that this improves app usability and information density compared to current foldables. Apps like Samsung Health, Files, and YouTube take full advantage of the larger canvas with optimized layouts and more visible content.</p><p>Samsung mentioned in its press release that the Galaxy Z TriFold is the first device with standalone Samsung DeX, and the video confirms it completely transforms the phone into a full computing device. It supports resizable windows, multi-app layouts, and a full desktop-style environment.</p><p>All things considered, the Galaxy Z TriFold looks like a promising device based on the video. It costs about $2,400 in Korea and goes on sale starting December 12, 2025. There's no U.S. pricing yet, but the foldable will likely cost slightly more than in Samsung's home market.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The tipster suggests the device will feature Leica-branded lenses with a focus on reducing reflections when taking photos. This, of course, is likely for situations with extreme brightness. The Weibo post claims that this change could help improve the 17 Ultra's ability to take "high definition and high fidelity" photos.</p><p>On the other hand, the device's alleged Leica-branded lens upgrades could also improve the device's chromatic aberration by "eliminating" it.</p><p>This essentially means the device may feature less optical distortion when users are snapping pictures. While there's likely to be some software tricks on the 17 Ultra to help further these changes, the tipster seems adamant that these main points are handled by the lenses themselves—so, it's all hardware strength.</p><h2 id="focusing-on-photography-2">Focusing on photography</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1662px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="fJWeQAvGuT7EXoGHSEYMXh" name="xiaomi-17-series-hero" alt="Xiaomi launches its 17 series with the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chip." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fJWeQAvGuT7EXoGHSEYMXh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1662" height="935" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Xiaomi)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There have been a host of rumors for the Xiaomi 17 Ultra in the past couple of months, especially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi/xiaomi-rumored-17-ultra-may-support-satellite-connectivity-over-the-latest-trio">regarding its cameras</a>. Previous rumors from another tipster purport that the device could jump from three lenses to four. There's a supposed chance that the 17 Ultra might feature three 50MP cameras and one 200MP lens. Those rumors from October said that the device could boast a few camera upgrades for its "imaging" features, as well as "optical tech" for its periscope lens.</p><p>We're starting to see what the upgraded imaging system <em>could </em>mean for the 17 Ultra, but there's still nothing concrete.</p><p>Alongside those camera rumors was a database listing that seems to indicate Xiaomi's efforts to plug satellite connectivity into the phone. It's worth being clear here that this was only spotted for the Chinese variant, meaning there's no guarantee that a global variant, or even one for India, would see the same support.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi/xiaomi-17-series-pro-pro-max-launch">Xiaomi 17 series launched</a> in September with its "Dynamic Back Display," which kind of brings that clamshell foldable cover display vibe to its rear panel.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The vertical stems and Blade Lights were a massive departure from the brand's identity and drew comparisons to Apple. But fresh leaks suggest Samsung is listening.</p><p>New imagery buried in the One UI 8.5 firmware code gives us our first confident look at the upcoming Galaxy Buds 4, courtesy of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-4-look-3621013/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>. Since the Galaxy Buds 3 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">Buds 3 Pro</a>, Samsung has been ditching the bean-shaped Buds design it has defended for years. And like their predecessor, the Galaxy Buds 4 are likely to continue leaning toward the AirPods crowd with a slimmer stem.</p><p>The upcoming buds appear to blend a semi-open fit with a short stem packed with outward-facing microphones. The stem-based structure appears similar to the Buds 3, but without the silicone ear tips <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-4-pro-leak-shows-a-major-redesign-and-wild-new-feature">found on the Buds 4 Pro that surfaced last month</a>.</p><h2 id="hardware-tweaks-2">Hardware tweaks</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:45.00%;"><img id="YRgQknBE6fDpdzFpaePKeg" name="galaxy-buds-4-one-ui-leak" alt="Galaxy Buds 4 Pro side by side with the Buds 4 showing the stem" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YRgQknBE6fDpdzFpaePKeg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Visually, these buds look significantly more mature. The leaked renders show a finish that mimics brushed aluminum, ditching the glossy plastic vibe of the previous generation. There is also a prominent new "wire-mesh" grille on the side. While we can’t confirm specs just yet, this almost certainly houses the microphones.</p><p>One specific detail hidden in the One UI 8.5 firmware in the earlier leak points to a new gesture control system for the Pro models. If the leak is accurate, you might be able to nod or shake your head to accept or reject calls. It's unclear if this feature will be available on the regular model.</p><p>Additionally, the charging case is reportedly returning to the horizontal cradle design. For a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxybuds/comments/1ecj88l/buds_3_and_buds_3_pro_bad_case_design/" target="_blank">few users</a>, the vertical insertion method on the Buds 3 was finicky, making it hard to seat the earbuds correctly. Going back to the flat, jewelry-box style case is a win for muscle memory and usability.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Previously, Google offered two separate experiences: the AI Overview, which gave a quick summary at the top of your search results, and AI Mode, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-searchs-ai-mode-is-now-giving-early-access-to-select-users">chat interface for follow-up questions</a>.</p><p>This new test tears down the wall between them. Now, when you tap "Show more" on an AI Overview, Google automatically shifts you into AI Mode. A dedicated "Ask anything" bar slides into view at the bottom of the screen, inviting you to ask follow-up questions immediately.</p><h2 id="search-without-starting-over-using-ai-mode-2">Search without starting over using AI Mode</h2><p>AI Mode can do much more than the Overview card. Overviews are designed for quick answers, but AI Mode is meant for deeper follow-up. It uses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-gemini-3-available-now-everything-you-need-to-know">Gemini 3</a> and earlier versions like Gemini 2.0 to handle complex questions, keep track of context, and give answers that mix text with images or videos when needed.</p><p>Behind the scenes, Google fans out multiple linked queries at once, a technique that allows AI Mode to stitch together broader, more nuanced responses. While AI Overviews remain the fast-answer option, AI Mode has become the place to explore — the part where you iterate, refine, and get into the weeds without restarting the whole search flow.</p><p>These design changes come with major technical upgrades. Google is also making its advanced models more widely available. Starting today, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-3-pro-googles-new-ai-model-aims-to-redefine-multimodal-understanding">Gemini 3 Pro</a> is launching in almost 120 countries and territories for English users.</p><p>This change is more than just a new look. By bridging the gap between standard results and AI Mode, Google is subtly retraining how we use Search. We are moving away from "search and click" toward "ask and chat." This is great for convenience, but website owners might be sweating a little.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Blaho states they discovered an "ads feature" in the early code of a ChatGPT app beta for Android users. The code contains quite a few mentions of advertisements to hit the app, such as "AdTarget," "SearchAd," "ApiAdTarget," and more. Blaho directly mentions other code mentions, like "bazaar content" and "search ads carousel."</p><p>So, while it seems that the ChatGPT app on Android is staring at an ad-filled future on Android, the X post went into more detail, stating this has been in the plans for a while.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/btibor91/status/1981740001126998496">subsequent post</a> highlights a post from October by The Information, which highlights OpenAI's ever-shifting stance on ads in the app. Supposedly, OpenAI is "considering whether ChatGPT could show ads based on its memory or the information it remembers," per an employee. Blaho <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/btibor91/status/1994913319455535541">goes further</a>, stating OpenAI is trying to figure out how to do this in a "careful way."</p><p>How this could appear to users isn't known; however, there's speculation that the ChatGPT app could display ads in a card-style without imposing on the chats users have with the AI directly. As one might expect, these ads could only impact users on the free tier of the ChatGPT app, not those who've subscribed to additional capabilities.</p><h2 id="chatgpt-s-going-with-the-flow-2">ChatGPT's going with the flow</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">ChatGPT Android app 1.2025.329 beta includes new references to an "ads feature" with "bazaar content", "search ad" and "search ads carousel" pic.twitter.com/BdHOJIQHmA<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1994714152636690834">November 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>Blaho compares what OpenAI is seemingly moving ChatGPT toward to what Google has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-ai-overviews-ads-announced">done with ads and AI Overviews</a>. Google announced last year that it was preparing to bring ads to results shown to users via AI Overviews. The idea was to be "more helpful," as the little snippets would display ads only if they were relevant to the user's query and to the information provided by the AI.</p><p>The company even highlighted some of its data, which reportedly showed that users who've seen ads have found them helpful. There's no doubt that users may have their own personal takes if this actually rolls out for ChatGPT on Android.</p><p>Outside of a potential ad bombardment, ChatGPT had an update on Android that brought <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify/spotify-in-chatgpt-android-create-entire-playlists-without-lifting-a-finger">its AI capabilities to music</a>. Users who've connected their Spotify Premium accounts to ChatGPT can have the AI find songs for them, play tracks, and even throw on their favorite weekly mixes, like Discover Weekly and New Music Friday. The entire update was very similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-spotify-extension-rollout-detailed">Spotify's extension for Gemini</a>, which offers more of the same tools for music discovery and playback.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It’s a lose-lose scenario that HMD Global and Norwegian smartwatch brand Xplora are finally trying to fix.</p><p>Instead of cramming another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">budget Android device</a> with TikTok-baiting features, the company has teamed up with Xplora to build a phone that tries the opposite approach. The new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://xplora.fi/products/xploraone" target="_blank">XploraOne</a> drops social media entirely.</p><p>If the name sounds familiar, that’s because Xplora has spent years making kid-focused wearables. But this is its first step into feature phone territory. The XploraOne offers core functions, supporting messaging, calling, location tracking, and a simple camera, without added games or app stores.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:610px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="tZ3PxFipYEWYDMF4SiqAQ7" name="XploraOne-by-HMD" alt="XploraOne by HMD" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tZ3PxFipYEWYDMF4SiqAQ7.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="610" height="610" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Xplora)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:610px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="BCHcbpCFwMZU2iTXBgxgN7" name="XploraOne-by-HMD" alt="XploraOne by HMD" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BCHcbpCFwMZU2iTXBgxgN7.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="610" height="610" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Xplora)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:610px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="KjaZoJ2pfws8GvYK4ZeZN7" name="XploraOne-by-HMD" alt="XploraOne by HMD" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KjaZoJ2pfws8GvYK4ZeZN7.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="610" height="610" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Xplora)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The camera setup on the XploraOne Mini is simple, though exact specifications have not been shared.

From the tipster's post, it seems that Motorola is preparing another collaboration with Swarovski Crystals. The alleged rendering suggests the Edge 70 could rock an all-white design with several crystals dotting its quilt-like back panel.</p><p>As the publication also notes, the image suggests that there will be 14 crystals dotting the device, adding to its shimmering appearance.</p><p>This rumored all-white design is complemented in the leak by the phone's silver frame and square camera housing. The device isn't rumored to arrive any differently than what the original Edge 70 launch provided, which isn't uncommon when compared to previous collaborations. The phone is expected to retain its rounded corners, three 50MP cameras, and more.</p><p>However, this all-white color scheme, according to Blass, is the Pantone Color of the Year for 2026 called "Cloud Dancer." Considering this additional rumor, perhaps we can look at Motorola's past to gauge when we <em>might </em>see this announced.</p><h2 id="from-just-peachy-to-a-smooth-mocha-2">From just Peachy to a smooth Mocha</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Motorola Edge 70, Swarovski edition, in Pantone Color of the Year 2026, Cloud Dancer. pic.twitter.com/J4otLq8oRo<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1994797013142327426">November 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>Motorola often dips into the Pantone Color of the Year, which is always in preparation for the coming year, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-special-edition-peach-fuzz-color">like its Peach Fuzz Razr</a>. In 2023, the company announced its Peach Fuzz Moto Razr for 2024, acting as Pantone's Color of the Year. The main takeaway here is that the company did so quite early in December, specifically on December 7, 2023. Another example is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-2024-razr-plus-pantone-rich-mocha-shade">Color of the Year for 2025</a>, Mocha, for the Razr Plus (2024) and the Edge 50 Neo.</p><p>The color was actually called Mocha Mousse. It bathed both devices in a rich and decadent mocha shade.</p><p>For the past two years, Motorola has announced its devices with a new Pantone shade late in the year, in December, and this rumor for the Edge 70 claims it could merge that and a Swarovski Crystal collab into one. <em>Maybe </em>we're looking at a December reveal this time around, too, but we'll have to wait and see.</p><p>Motorola <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-brilliant-razr-2025-buds-loop-swarovski-collaboration-shines-launch">already had one Swarovski collaboration</a> earlier this year with the Razr 2025. The foldable featured "35 precisely hand-positioned Swarovski crystals" on its quilted design, alongside a special Pantone Ice Melt color. This collaboration also included the company's Buds Loop earbuds.</p> ]]></dc:content>

To add to it, the Indian government just mandated all phone manufacturers to pre-install its Sanchar Saathi app on all future phones. Not only that, the government is ordering manufacturers to roll out an OTA to install the app on existing phones.</p><p>The Sanchar Saathi <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dot.app.sancharsaathi">app is available on the Play Store</a> — where it has over 10 million downloads as of writing — and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apps.apple.com/in/app/sanchar-saathi/id6739700695">App Store</a>, but with the government mandate, it will make its way to all phones in the country. It isn't just Android phones being affected either, as the order also includes iPhones.</p><p>The Play Store listing says the app doesn't collect or share any data, but that is not the case. I installed it on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/oppo-find-x9-pro-review">Find X9 Pro</a>, and it needs phone state permission — ostensibly to track lost devices — as well as SMS access, and if you don't provide these details, it automatically exits. That's not all either; once you register, Sanchar Saathi needs access to your camera, call logs and even device storage.</p><p>The Indian government says the app is a cybersecurity solution aimed at "empowering" mobile users in the country, but having it pre-installed on all phones is a heavy-handed move, and given the sheer amount of data is has access to, it's hard to see this move as a good thing. What's even more egregious is that the Sanchar Saathi app cannot be disabled or uninstalled once it's pre-loaded on a device.</p><p>Phone manufacturers have 90 days to comply with the mandate, but at this point, it's unclear whether they will be able to do so. I reached out to Google, and the brand said that it is evaluating the order, but that there isn't anything to share at the moment. Apple, similarly, didn't have anything to share as of now.</p><p>Vivo, Xiaomi, and OnePlus told me there wasn't a statement yet, and OPPO indicated that it is evaluating the situation internally, with a statement imminent. In typical Samsung fashion, the brand didn't get back to my query, but I'll update this post once I have additional information.</p> ]]></dc:content>

But you still have time! And if you're looking for a cheap Android phone deal, there's one obvious pick that won't feel too expensive this late in the game: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Unlocked-Smartphone-Charging-Expandable/dp/B0DLHLRDBY"><strong>Samsung Galaxy A16 5G for $149 ($50 off) at Amazon</strong></a>.</p><p>Among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones-under-200">best Android phones under $200</a>, this and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/the-best-under-usd200-android-phone-is-another-usd50-off-for-cyber-monday-but-you-need-to-hurry">Moto G 2025</a> have the same Cyber Monday deal price. But while Moto's phone is ranked first in our guide, there are very good reasons to pick the A16 instead! Its 6.7-inch, 1080p display is higher resolution and uses OLED instead of LCD, it's slightly more water resistant (IP54 vs. IP52), and it gets <em>six</em> years of software updates, while Motorola only promises three years.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="5b8592f0-ce29-47ca-9d0c-5773d99d4d34" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="best cheap Samsung phones" data-dimension48="best cheap Samsung phones" data-dimension25="$149.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Unlocked-Smartphone-Charging-Expandable/dp/B0DLHLRDBY" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="zAQQFctoxrrskMn3BqYCS5" name="Samsung Galaxy A16" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zAQQFctoxrrskMn3BqYCS5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>We gave the Galaxy A16 5G our "best value" rank among the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/cheapest-samsung-phones-you-can-buy-today" data-dimension112="5b8592f0-ce29-47ca-9d0c-5773d99d4d34" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="best cheap Samsung phones" data-dimension48="best cheap Samsung phones" data-dimension25="$149.99">best cheap Samsung phones</a>, more affordable than other picks while still delivering the long software support, 5G connectivity, and baseline of quality that you'd expect from a Samsung phone. Its $149 price tag matches an <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0DLHLRDBY">all-time low</a>, one we only saw once back in July for Prime Day.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Unlocked-Smartphone-Charging-Expandable/dp/B0DLHLRDBY" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="5b8592f0-ce29-47ca-9d0c-5773d99d4d34" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="best cheap Samsung phones" data-dimension48="best cheap Samsung phones" data-dimension25="$149.99">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You want to spend as little money as possible without compromising on basic quality, and you expect your smartphone to last for years with regular updates and no security concerns. You'd prefer a 1080p, 800-nit AMOLED display to the Moto G's 720p, 120Hz LCD display.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You're able to splurge for the Galaxy A36 — currently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/samsung-galaxy-a36-5g-128gb-unlocked-awesome-lime/JJGRF3CK9C"><strong>$274.99 ($125 off) at Best Buy</strong></a> — and receive upgrades to performance, memory, display refresh rate (120Hz) and brightness (1,900 nits), charging speed (45W), and protection (Victus+ glass and IP67 dust & water resistance).</p><p>While most of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best budget Android phones</a> are discounted for Cyber Monday, they're still pricier than what you'd pay for the Galaxy A16, like $449 for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">Pixel 9a</a> or $284 for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/moto-g-stylus-2025-review">Moto G Stylus 2025</a>. The Galaxy A16 can't match these mid-range phones for raw hardware and performance, but the Galaxy name does guarantee a certain level of software quality that most other budget phones can't match.</p><p>Our advice? Either go for the Galaxy A16 5G or look at the 2025 lineup of Moto G phones, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-2025-review">Moto G 2025</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-power-2025-review">Moto G Power 2025</a>.

Also if your laptop or desktop don't have enough ports or are missing specific ports.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You couldn't care less for tech collaborations, in which case you might as well get the standard version, unless you don't think you need a docking station.</p><h2 id="power-and-style-all-in-one-2">Power and style, all in one</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="p5DPGMgPeGRErAuoWxwsNJ" name="Anker-Black-Myth-Wukong-Limited-Edition-Prime-Docking-Station-6" alt="The Anker x Black Myth: Wukong Edition Prime Docking Station" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p5DPGMgPeGRErAuoWxwsNJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I've been using the Anker x Black Myth: Wukong Edition Prime Docking Station for some time now, and I can't believe I've gone this long without one of these. Aside from the stylish design (which I'll get to later), this is an incredibly versatile docking station that has just about anything anyone might need at their desk, especially if they work from home like me.</p><p>Surprisingly, between my work laptop and my personal laptop, I don't really have all the ports and connections that I would want. This power station solves that problem thanks to its 14 ports, including multiple USB-C and USB-A ports, SD and microSD card readers, a 3.5mm headphone jack, and multiple HDMI ports. Not only can it provide up to 140W of power to your laptop, but the front USB-C ports support up to 10Gbps and charge up to 100W, which is enough for any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a>.</p><p>For anyone working from home, you can connect up to three displays to your Mac or PC, with one display supporting up to 8K resolution and the other two supporting 4K. Plus, you have an Ethernet port for fast data speeds up to 2.5Gbps, and a small display in front to monitor your connections (and it also doubles as a nice clock).</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="m9MpgZ5roYNPHuMDcvjmqJ" name="Anker-Black-Myth-Wukong-Limited-Edition-Prime-Docking-Station-7" alt="The Anker x Black Myth: Wukong Edition Prime Docking Station" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/m9MpgZ5roYNPHuMDcvjmqJ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="kkB9f79345HX2SPyeHTJcJ" name="Anker-Black-Myth-Wukong-Limited-Edition-Prime-Docking-Station-5" alt="The Anker x Black Myth: Wukong Edition Prime Docking Station" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kkB9f79345HX2SPyeHTJcJ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="dgRLbFAyvsz4aKijSKfZPJ" name="Anker-Black-Myth-Wukong-Limited-Edition-Prime-Docking-Station-2" alt="The Anker x Black Myth: Wukong Edition Prime Docking Station" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dgRLbFAyvsz4aKijSKfZPJ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="pYkdUyBZFfbdVeJyVBtfhJ" name="Anker-Black-Myth-Wukong-Limited-Edition-Prime-Docking-Station-1" alt="The Anker x Black Myth: Wukong Edition Prime Docking Station" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pYkdUyBZFfbdVeJyVBtfhJ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="X4JcVEJXgYPTNzX8xBWAbJ" name="Anker-Black-Myth-Wukong-Limited-Edition-Prime-Docking-Station-4" alt="The Anker x Black Myth: Wukong Edition Prime Docking Station" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/X4JcVEJXgYPTNzX8xBWAbJ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The design is truly something. There are gold accents throughout for the Anker x Black Myth: Wukong moniker, an image of the Destined One, and even the control knob on the side, all of which stand out against the mostly black-and-gray chassis. Even the front panel has an interesting yet subtle golden pattern that fades into black as it approaches the display, and all the labels in front are also golden.</p><p>Anker takes this collaboration to another level by including a selection of screen savers for the display, all inspired by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/black-myth-wukong-review/">Black Myth: Wukong</a>.

Samsung just did what it does best and threw us a three-panel curveball, officially unveiling its Galaxy Z TriFold today (Dec 1).</p><p>The company stated in its press release that this form factor was long overdue and showcases "engineering mastery with its most advanced  foldable technologies optimized for the unique demands of a multi-folding design." From the looks of it, the Galaxy Z TriFold is incredibly thin, competing with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>, featuring a large 10-inch display and two panels that fold inwards.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:49.58%;"><img id="bukQhooK7gDq5ZArhKP9xN" name="Galaxy-Z-Trifold" alt="Samsung unveils Galaxy Z Trifold, and it will arrive in the US next year!" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bukQhooK7gDq5ZArhKP9xN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1440" height="714" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Getting right into the specs of the device, the Galaxy Z TriFold showcases a 10-inch QXGA Dynamic AMOLED main screen when unfolded, which gets a 120Hz refresh rate and 1,600 nits of peak brightness. It also features a 6.5-inch cover screen that can get extremely bright with 2600 nits, making it highly visible even in direct sunlight. Considering its incredibly large screen, the Galaxy Z TriFold is the first phone to have "a standalone <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-dex-review-isnt-replacement-your-laptop">Samsung DeX</a> available, meaning users can set up a full working environment on the go."</p><p>As for its dimensions, the Galaxy Z Trifold measures 3.9mm at its thinnest point (screen with the SIM tray), 4.2 mm (center screen), and 4.0 mm (screen with the side button), when unfolded. The device weighs only 309 grams and features Corning Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 on the cover, a Titanium hinge, and an advanced armor aluminum frame.</p><p>Samsung has made two differently sized hinges that ensure a smoother folding experience, allowing the panels to close without leaving any gaps. It gets an IP48 rating, giving it resistance against freshwater immersion and solid objects.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="yzrMkPU2ByHe5dgJ49hk9P" name="Galaxy-Z-Trifold" alt="Samsung unveils Galaxy Z Trifold, and it will arrive in the US next year!" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v2/t:171,l:0,cw:4500,ch:2531,q:80/yzrMkPU2ByHe5dgJ49hk9P.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4500" height="3000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When folded, the rear panel of the TriFold looks a lot like the Galaxy Z Fold 7, showcasing a triple camera array, sitting atop a vertical pill-shaped island. It gets a massive 200 MP wide-angle sensor with 2x optical quality zoom, an ultra-wide 12 MP camera, and a 10 MP telephoto lens. The cover screen gets a 10MP selfie camera along with a 10MP under-display camera on the main screen, making it easier to click selfies even when the device is unfolded.</p><p>At its core, the Galaxy Z TriFold gets the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-vs-regular-snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a> (3 nm), a massive 5,600 mAh battery that supports super-fast Charging 2.0 (45 W), capable of reaching up to 50% charge in about 30 minutes.

Galaxy AI's latest smarts, along with Gemini Live, will be fully integrated into the phone, giving it multimodal AI, enabling seamless multitasking without the need to switch apps.</p><p>Lastly, although the Korean OEM hasn't revealed the pricing details as yet, the company states that the Galaxy Z TriFold will first launch in Korea, followed by other markets, and will reach the U.S. only in the first quarter of 2026, with details of its launch coming soon.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Fast forward to today, and it remains one of the best options out there. But now, it's one of the best Cyber Monday Chromebook deals, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-15-6-with-google-ai-amoled-display-intel-core-3-8gb-memory-256gb-storage-neptune-blue/J3ZYG24W5G"><strong>as it's $150 off</strong></a>.</p><p>Frankly, we're kind of surprised to see that this deal is still hanging around, as it was one of the first big Black Friday deals we saw. However, there are still a bunch of great <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025">Samsung Cyber Monday deals</a> going on, so it's awesome to see the Galaxy Chromebook Plus included.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="409e3f4d-e758-4c7b-9b33-519402dc988f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus: $749.99" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus: $749.99" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-15-6-with-google-ai-amoled-display-intel-core-3-8gb-memory-256gb-storage-neptune-blue/J3ZYG24W5G" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="VCR79RjWNeApWsJnDjX3tY" name="samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-square-render.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VCR79RjWNeApWsJnDjX3tY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-15-6-with-google-ai-amoled-display-intel-core-3-8gb-memory-256gb-storage-neptune-blue/J3ZYG24W5G" data-dimension112="409e3f4d-e758-4c7b-9b33-519402dc988f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus: $749.99" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus: $749.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$749.99</del> <strong>$549.99 at Best Buy</strong></a></p><p>Do you want one of the best and thinnest Chromebooks that money can buy? What if we told you that there's a last minute Cyber Monday deal that saves you $150? If we've piqued your interest, the Galaxy Chromebook Plus is still on sale for $150 off, but time's running out.</p><p><strong>Price comparison: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/garmin-instinct-crossover-amoled-gps-smartwatch-47-mm-fiber-reinforced-polymer-charcoal-with-charcoal-silicone-band-2025/JXF9YFF4XR/sku/6646681?">Samsung - $549.99</a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-15-6-with-google-ai-amoled-display-intel-core-3-8gb-memory-256gb-storage-neptune-blue/J3ZYG24W5G" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="409e3f4d-e758-4c7b-9b33-519402dc988f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus: $749.99" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus: $749.99" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You want a Chromebook that's incredibly thin and lightweight, while still being able to enjoy a beautiful and massive 15.6-inch AMOLED display.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You need a Chromebook that offers a bit more "oomph" in the horsepower department, or one that sports a convertible design.</p><p>Very few expected Samsung to jump back into the Chromebook mix, but it did so with a bang. This was the first Chromebook to be released with the Quick Insert key, giving you easy access to Gemini from practically anywhere. Not only that, but it understands the context of whatever window you're using, meaning that when pressed, the Quick Insert menu will show relevant and/related tasks.</p><p>The star of the show, for some at least, is the gorgeous 15.6-inch AMOLED touchscreen display. Outside of those who suffer from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM</a>, Samsung's displays are some of the best out there, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review">Galaxy Chromebook Plus</a> is no different.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="gGwJinCDt8GHZCH2xckc8o" name="samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review-22.jpg" alt="Comparing the thickness between the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus, Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gGwJinCDt8GHZCH2xckc8o.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For others, the Galaxy Chromebook Plus is an intriguing option due to how thin and lightweight it is. It weighs just 2.58 pounds, and at the thinnest point measures in at a mere 11.8mm (0.46-inches.) Surprisingly, this is actually thinner than the Galaxy Z Fold 6, but of course, not the redesigned <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/this-insane-cyber-monday-deal-is-probably-the-last-time-well-see-the-galaxy-z-fold-7-so-cheap-until-the-fold-8-arrives">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>.</p><p>As you'd expect, it's no slouch in the performance department either. It's powered by the Intel Core 3 100U chip, paired with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of expandable storage. However, this is the only configuration that Samsung offers, which is rather disappointing.</p><p>Nevertheless, with Cyber Monday winding to a close, it won't be long before this deal is gone again. So make sure you jump on the train before it runs out of steam.</p><h2 id="cyber-monday-2025-quick-links-7">Cyber Monday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/1943169/614286/10014?subId1=ac-us-5615807595891508749&sharedId=ac-us&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Ftop-deals" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1299702941074104322-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1943169/568844/9383?subId1=ac-us-7409176726029051954&sharedId=ac-us&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwalmart.com%2Fshop%2Fdeals" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=kXQk6%2AivFEQ&mid=47773&u1=ac-us-7508986579345782498&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2F" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100048248-15733793?sid=ac-us-5382800771118243653&url=https://www.verizon.com/deals/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.prf.hn/click/camref:1101l3ZJWb/pubref:ac-us-6188419669973889380/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Foffers%2Fsamsung-phone-deals" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://mint-mobile.pxf.io/c/221109/444520/7915?subId1=ac-us-7290658344113693644&sharedId=ac-us&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mintmobile.com%2Fdeals%2F" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100048248-15735111?sid=ac-us-1259408622221942527&url=https://www.att.com/deals/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong><br></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><em><strong>Cyber Monday Google Pixel deals</strong></em></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><em><strong>Cyber Monday Motorola deals</strong></em></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Make sure to <a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=androidcentral.com" target="_blank"><strong>set Android Central as a preferred source</strong></a> in Google Search, and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should"><strong>find out why you should</strong></a> so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>Google seems to be ringing in the holidays on a great note! It just silently dropped a teaser of the "Android Show: XR Edition" showcasing two Android bots wearing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-galaxy-xr-hands-on-impressions">Galaxy XR headset</a> and the rumoured <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/my-demo-with-googles-ar-glasses-went-better-than-the-one-on-stage">XR smart glasses</a>.</p><p>The show is set to be livestreamed on December 8, where Google will talk all about the "Future of Android XR." During the show, the tech giant is expected to discuss  "all things XR across glasses, headsets, and everything in between." Which seems exciting since the Galaxy XR headset just launched in October, and now we may get a glimpse at the progress Google and Android have made on smartglasses—and we aren't complaining! The tease does showcase the bot wearing glasses with a tiny lens on one side.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a3-OJxxW810" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Additionally, Google says that we will get to "Hear how with Gemini by your side, you can have a more conversational, contextual, and helpful experience," all within the 30-minute show. A dedicated teaser page was also spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/12/01/android-xr-show-dec-2025/">9to5Google</a>, which allows you to set a reminder for the show, asking enthusiasts to "Mark their calendars to learn about the latest XR innovations and experiences at The Android Show," much like the YouTube teaser, which also features a "notify me" button.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-galaxy-xr-hands-on-impressions">Galaxy XR </a>is already loaded with so much of Gemini, including Gemini Live, including the real-world search experience that comes with Circle to Search, and the immersive view in Google Maps that basically makes you feel that you're exploring a new touristy spot right from the comfort of your couch. Gemini also offers route suggestions and personalized information, or historical facts based on what you're looking at.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2U3BvOHuNXo" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>While the future of XR is still a mystery, we'd definitely like to see the Memory feature that Google showed us at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-i-o-2025-the-biggest-announcements-from-ai-to-android-xr">I/O earlier this year</a>, where Gemini will use the cameras on the XR devices to log the location of real-world items. You could later ask, "Hey Gemini, where did I leave my keys?" and it would show you where it last saw them.</p><p>So if you're as excited as we are about this end-of-the-year reveal, then go ahead and hit the "notify me" button to watch the action unfold in real time.</p> ]]></dc:content>

That's exactly what the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-3-review">OnePlus Pad 3</a> gets right. It sports one of the largest screens of any Android tablet on the market, with a 13.2-inch LCD panel featuring a 3392 x 2400 resolution and a 144Hz refresh rate. On top of that, there's a Snapdragon 8 Elite chip paired with 12GB or 16GB or memory to handle just about anything.</p><p>That's similar, or better than, the best Samsung has to offer. For example, the latest Samsung Galaxy Tab models have shipped with MediaTek processors following a switch from Qualcomm chips. If you want the best Qualcomm chips for AI and general performance, the OnePlus Pad 3 is your only option.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="6H6maSEcHzfNXUeFKpWCQN" name="Notes app - OnePlus Pad 3" alt="Notes app - OnePlus Pad 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6H6maSEcHzfNXUeFKpWCQN.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="HpbtmNPDxyTrnCce7t58PN" name="ES-DE for Android on the OnePlus Pad 3" alt="ES-DE for Android on the OnePlus Pad 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HpbtmNPDxyTrnCce7t58PN.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="kRz7rTtnrWGzv5hZDCgsMN" name="Back of OnePlus Pad 3" alt="Back of OnePlus Pad 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kRz7rTtnrWGzv5hZDCgsMN.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="q5ZgZk2NLhe89Hbfn9myLN" name="OnePlus Pad 3 with keyboard removed" alt="OnePlus Pad 3 with keyboard removed" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/q5ZgZk2NLhe89Hbfn9myLN.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="qbYEMLXFUTb3edAzyByAMN" name="OnePlus Pad 3 and Pad 2" alt="OnePlus Pad 3 and Pad 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qbYEMLXFUTb3edAzyByAMN.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Better yet, it's more affordable than a Samsung tablet. It runs Android 16, and OxygenOS has come a long way, so it's very easy to use. There are also incredible multitasking features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-oxygenos-16-arrives-as-a-software-that-truly-knows-you">Open Canvas</a>, which lets you use up to five apps at once.</p><p>If I was in the market for an Android tablet this Cyber Monday, I'd go for the OnePlus Pad 3. It's much better than cheaper options while hitting a reasonable price point, which is something that Samsung's flagship tablets can't do.

For me, at least, the Meta Quest 3 and Quest 3S controllers are <em>very</em> easy to drop. I find them to be slightly slippery and just a tad uncomfortable for some games.

If the $150 credit doesn't show up for you, try refreshing the page or selecting other options, and see if the website decides to show this "exclusive" discount for you; if it doesn't, at least you can save $100, or more with a trade-in.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="8aa7ae67-52cf-4375-b7bc-44e98c7c47cf" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Android Central verdict:" data-dimension48="Android Central verdict:" data-dimension25="$199.99" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/watches/galaxy-watch8/buy/galaxy-watch8-40mm-graphite-wi-fi-bluetooth-sku-sm-l320ndaaxaa/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="pNxS2G8Htu9DPyvetR6euN" name="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pNxS2G8Htu9DPyvetR6euN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-review" data-dimension112="8aa7ae67-52cf-4375-b7bc-44e98c7c47cf" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Android Central verdict:" data-dimension48="Android Central verdict:" data-dimension25="$199.99"><strong>Android Central verdict: </strong>★★★★½</a></p><p>We rank the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 as the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android smartwatch</a> of 2025. It's certainly the most comfortable, with the best integration for Galaxy phone owners and the longest software support through 2029. While I also recommend the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4-review">Pixel Watch 4</a> as a more stylish alternative, its Cyber Monday deal is much smaller.</p><p>Our Galaxy Watch 8 reviewer appreciated that it's lightweight for sleep tracking and workouts, while still well-protected with sapphire glass and an MIL-STD-810H rating. It has fast performance with plenty of RAM, and while its battery life isn't the best, you probably won't want to spend a few hundred extra just to upgrade for the Galaxy Watch Ultra.</p><p>Other retailers: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Coaching-Tracking/dp/B0F7QD4HSD"><strong>Amazon</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/samsung-galaxy-watch8-aluminum-smartwatch-40mm-bt-silver-2025/JJGRF3X43F"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/watches/galaxy-watch8/buy/galaxy-watch8-40mm-graphite-wi-fi-bluetooth-sku-sm-l320ndaaxaa/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="8aa7ae67-52cf-4375-b7bc-44e98c7c47cf" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Android Central verdict:" data-dimension48="Android Central verdict:" data-dimension25="$199.99">View Deal</a></p></div><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="dFwawDhK2LrM7KbNczM7fQ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Review-2" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dFwawDhK2LrM7KbNczM7fQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You want to prioritize affordability, but without losing hardware quality. You have a Samsung phone — the Galaxy Watch has a couple of exclusive features — and you want a design that's well-suited for sleep tracking, with unique stats like Antioxidant Index, Energy Score, and Vascular Load.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You dislike the unique squircle case design, you have a Pixel or OnePlus phone that'd work better with another smartwatch, or you're willing to pay extra for a Classic or Ultra.</p><p>You can also find some pretty massive discounts on Samsung's pricier models, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/watches/galaxy-watch8-classic/buy/galaxy-watch8-classic-46mm-black-wi-fi-bluetooth-sku-sm-l500nzkdxaa/"><strong>$200 off the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic</strong></a>, making it cheaper than the original Galaxy Watch 8 price. I enjoyed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic-review">reviewing the Watch 8 Classic</a> because of its rotating bezel for more exact controls, along with a more traditional style. But the Watch 8 is the better last-minute deal, simply because it's $100 cheaper and lightweight enough to fit any wrist size.</p><p>I don't know how long these hidden Samsung watch deals will last — or even if you'll see them — but I assume they'll go away once Cyber Monday ends tonight. So if you're at all interested in a smartwatch upgrade, now's the time!</p><h2 id="cyber-monday-deals-quick-links-12">Cyber Monday deals - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Cyber Monday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Cyber Monday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Cyber Monday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Cyber Monday</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Beyond that, you'll find premium features on the best sets that a cheap pair of $50 earbuds just can't deliver. Here's what makes the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro worth buying</p><p><strong>The Price</strong>. I have to start here, and that's probably pretty important to you, too. These are normally $250, and today they are marked down to $150. Saving a hundo is sweet.</p><p><strong>Packed with features</strong>. Samsung has leveraged the tiny computer inside these buds to make them do so much more than just be a speaker. A new audio codec (if you have the right phone), head tracking spatial audio, Galaxy AI, seamless device switching, and more. A lot more.</p><p><strong>They fit great for most people</strong>. You will see some reviews from folks who can't seem to keep them inside their ears, but most people love the fit of these. Samsung redesigned that body and angle, and in my experience, it works great.</p><p><strong>Excellent ANC</strong>. Usually, when you keep adding features, you reach a point where the battery can't keep up. ANC is very power-hungry and is often the first thing to be scaled back. Not on these; even with everything else going on, the Buds 3 Pro have world-class ANC.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-cons"><span>The cons</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2tmbQWqBtYZjYeRixp3AdW" name="galaxy-buds3-pro-buds-alone.jpg" alt="Galaxy Buds 3 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2tmbQWqBtYZjYeRixp3AdW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Nothing is perfect, and there is one big flaw with the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro: they were specifically built with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-through-cyber-monday-is-the-best-time-to-build-a-product-ecosystem">Galaxy ecosystem</a> in mind.</p><p>You might be thinking, "How is that a flaw?" and you're right. Flaw is a harsh word, but it can be a deal breaker. Unless you have a fairly new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung Galaxy phone</a>, you're going to be missing out a little.</p><p>Let me start by saying right up front: if you use an iPhone, don't buy these. They essentially are just another pair of Bluetooth earbuds, and if you want them to do more, you need to buy earbuds from Apple.</p><p>For everyone else, the list of what's missing without a new Galaxy phone is still mighty long. You won't get the same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-android-users-need-know-about-spatial-audio">spatial audio</a> experience, and there's no head tracking. Some AI features, notably the real-time Interpreter, only function with a Galaxy phone. If you have something like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> (which is how I use them), the quick pairing and seamless switching are awesome. Without a Galaxy phone, it's mediocre. ANC is still excellent, but it loses some of the adaptive qualities that put it over the top when used without a phone using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-announces-new-galaxy-ai-health-and-fitness-insights">Galaxy AI</a>. Finally, the SSC (Samsung Seamless Audio) high-res audio support - one of the best <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bluetooth-audio-terms-codecs-explained">Bluetooth audio codecs</a> available - <strong>only</strong> works when paired to a new Galaxy phone.</p><p>These work with any Android phone, and they still sound good and have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-noise-canceling-headphones">great ANC</a>, but the best way to use them is with a new phone from Samsung.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-my-verdict"><span>My verdict</span></h3><p>What phone are you using? If you have something like a Galaxy S25 or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-review">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a>, then <strong>hell yeah. It's a yes from me, dawg</strong>. If you aren't, then maybe you might want to check out some others before you plunk that money down.</p><p>I will mention that if the Galaxy S24 Ultra were my main phone, I would use these every day simply because they sound almost as good as a very expensive set of wired earbuds. For real. Unfortunately, with my Motorola Razr, they don't.</p><p>If you have an iPhone, spring for a pair of AirPods. If you have a Pixel, the Pixel Buds are calling you. The list goes on, and even companies like OnePlus offer earbuds that are good with all phones, but best when used with the same brand of products. It's simply how it is.</p><h2 id="cyber-monday-2025-quick-links-27">Cyber Monday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/1943169/614286/10014?subId1=ac-us-5615807595891508749&sharedId=ac-us&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Ftop-deals" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1299702941074104322-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1943169/568844/9383?subId1=ac-us-7409176726029051954&sharedId=ac-us&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwalmart.com%2Fshop%2Fdeals" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=kXQk6%2AivFEQ&mid=47773&u1=ac-us-7508986579345782498&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2F" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100048248-15733793?sid=ac-us-5382800771118243653&url=https://www.verizon.com/deals/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.prf.hn/click/camref:1101l3ZJWb/pubref:ac-us-6188419669973889380/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Foffers%2Fsamsung-phone-deals" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://mint-mobile.pxf.io/c/221109/444520/7915?subId1=ac-us-7290658344113693644&sharedId=ac-us&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mintmobile.com%2Fdeals%2F" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100048248-15735111?sid=ac-us-1259408622221942527&url=https://www.att.com/deals/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong><br></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><em><strong>Cyber Monday Google Pixel deals</strong></em></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><em><strong>Cyber Monday Motorola deals</strong></em></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Also if you want HDMI connection without needing an extra dongle.</p><h2 id="transform-your-phone-into-the-ultimate-entertainment-device-2">Transform your phone into the ultimate entertainment device</h2><p>The Aurzen ZIP Tri-Fold Portable Projector is one of the most unique devices I've seen this year. In fact, it impressed us enough that it was one of our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-centrals-best-of-mwc-2025">Best of MWC 2025</a> winners!</p><p>This small, foldable device can project a bright 100-lumen image by mirroring your phone. This can turn any moment into a movie night if there's no TV in sight. Just connect and go! According to Aurzen, there's no lag, and the projector can adjust the image based on the angle to avoid distortion.</p><p>And it doesn't just work for horizontal videos; it can also display vertical videos without black bars by turning it on its side. And because of its tri-fold design, you can angle it in many different ways, from straight on to straight up. There's also a separate magnetic mount that you can stick on nearly any surface, letting you get creative with your projector placement, or use the magnetic stand to prop it up and double your battery life for movie nights (both accessories sold separately or in a bundle).</p><p>What's great is that it supports smartphone connections, but you can also connect it to your PS5 or Nintendo Switch, granted you have the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://aurzen.com/collections/zip-series-portable-projector/products/castplay-wireless-hdmi-transmitter">HDMI transmitter</a> (sold separately). This makes it a great backup in case you find yourself without a TV.</p><p>It's also extremely portable, weighing about as much as a large flagship smartphone but at half the size. So you can just stick it in your pocket if you don't have the carrying case.</p><p>Of course, there are downsides, such as a native 720p resolution (which supports 1080p upscaling), short battery life, and a lack of ports, but these are concessions that you can expect from such a portable yet powerful projector such as this.</p><p>If you're looking for a stocking stuffer, this would definitely make a great gift!</p><h2 id="cyber-monday-2025-quick-links-32">Cyber Monday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Cyber Monday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Cyber Monday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Cyber Monday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Cyber Monday</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Like most smart speakers, the device offers instant access to Amazon's Alexa voice assistant, seamlessly letting users cue up music on their favorite streaming services or control smart home devices such as lights, thermostats, and more.</p><p>The Echo Dot also comes with a ring LED light on the bottom of the unit, unlike previous generations, which included a similar light near the top. It also has a 3.5mm headphone output, in case users want to plug the device into an external speaker, a TV, or another device. This deal is available for all three of the Amazon Echo Dot smart speaker colors, including Charcoal, Deep Sea Blue, and Glacier White.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$49.99" data-dimension48="$49.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-vibrant-helpful-routines-Charcoal/dp/B09B8V1LZ3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:766px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="LdeR7Dvz9zXRXv8xYGvWET" name="amazon-echo-dot-5th-gen-square-render.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LdeR7Dvz9zXRXv8xYGvWET.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="766" height="766" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Amazon Echo Dot:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-vibrant-helpful-routines-Charcoal/dp/B09B8V1LZ3" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$49.99" data-dimension48="$49.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$49.99</del> <strong>$31.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>The Amazon Echo Dot just dropped 36% during <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-amazon-deals-2025">Amazon's Cyber Monday sale</a>, meaning it's currently just $31.
